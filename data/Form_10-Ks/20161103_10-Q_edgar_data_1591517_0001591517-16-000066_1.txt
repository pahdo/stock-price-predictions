  1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Description of Business  
  Time Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "us" or "our"), is one of the world's leading media companies, with a monthly global print audience of over   120 million   and worldwide digital properties that attract more than   150 million   visitors each month, including over   60   websites. Our influential brands include People, Sports Illustrated, InStyle, Time, Real Simple, Southern Living, Entertainment Weekly, Travel + Leisure, Cooking Light, Fortune and Food   Wine, as well as more than   50   diverse titles in the United Kingdom, such as Decanter, Horse   Hound and Wallpaper*. Time Inc. is home to celebrated franchises and events, including the Fortune 500, Time 100, People s Sexiest Man Alive, Sports Illustrated s Sportsperson of the Year, the Food   Wine Classic in Aspen, the Essence Festival and the biennial Fortune Global Forum.   Hundreds of thousands   of people attend our live media events every year. We have been extending the power of our brands through various investments and acquisitions, including the formation of Sports Illustrated Play, a new business devoted to youth and amateur sports, and the acquisitions of INVNT, a company that specializes in live media, and Viant, an advertising technology firm with a specialized people-based marketing platform. We also provide content marketing, targeted local print and digital advertising programs, branded book publishing and marketing and support services, including subscription sales services for magazines and other products, retail distribution and marketing services and customer service and fulfillment services, for ourselves and third-party clients, including other magazine publishers. 
  Basis of Presentation  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which are referred to herein as the  Financial Statements,  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these Financial Statements. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include accounting for asset impairments, multiple-element transactions, allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, magazine returns, business combinations, pension and other post-retirement benefits, equity-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies, litigation matters and reporting for certain transactions on a gross versus a net basis.  
  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not exercise control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are designated as available-for-sale if readily determinable fair values are available. If an investment s fair value is not readily determinable, we account for our investment under the cost method.  
  The financial position and operating results of our foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Translation gains or losses on assets and liabilities are included as a component of   Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net  .

  Recent Accounting Guidance 
  Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2016 
  In March 2016, guidance was issued which applies to entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective April 1, 2016 and it has not had an impact on our Financial Statements since adoption.  
  In September 2015, guidance was issued that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments following a business combination. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The prior period impact of the adjustment is to be presented separately on the face of the statement of operations or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods therein with early application permitted. We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2016 and it has not had a significant impact on our Financial Statements since adoption. 
  In April 2015, guidance was issued for the accounting of fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. In accordance with the provisions of this standard, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. However, if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new guidance, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, does not change customers' accounting for service contracts. We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2016 and it has not had a significant impact on our Financial Statements since adoption. 
  In June 2014, guidance was issued impacting the accounting for share-based performance awards. This guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The amendments in this guidance became effective on a prospective basis for us on January 1, 2016. We do not currently have share-based payment awards that fall within the scope of this guidance. Therefore, it has not had an impact on our Financial Statements since adoption.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted 
  In August 2016, guidance was issued which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be classified as well as how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on our Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, guidance was issued which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017 and do not expect it to have a significant impact on our Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, guidance was issued which requires that a lessee recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about its leasing arrangements. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated guidance will have on our Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
  In January 2016, guidance was issued which requires equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein.  We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated guidance will have on our Financial Statements and related disclosures  . 
  In July 2015, guidance was issued that simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein with earlier application permitted. We will adopt this guidance on a prospective basis on January 1, 2017 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our Financial Statements upon adoption.  
  In August 2014, guidance was issued that establishes management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and setting rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance for the year ended December 31, 2016 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our Financial Statements upon adoption.  
  In May 2014, guidance was issued that establishes a new revenue recognition framework in GAAP for all companies and industries. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue from the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive for those goods or services. The guidance includes a five-step framework to determine the timing and amount of revenue to recognize related to contracts with customers. In addition, this guidance requires new or expanded disclosures related to the judgments made by companies when following this framework. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2018, however, we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that the updated guidance will have on our Financial Statements and related disclosures. We expect to complete this evaluation by June 30, 2017. 
  Other accounting standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our Financial Statements upon adoption.

Interim Impairment Testing of Long-Lived Assets 
  Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets (e.g., tradenames, customer lists and property, plant and equipment), do not require that an annual impairment test be performed. Instead, long-lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for continued use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset or group of assets ("asset group") against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the asset or group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. If the intent is to hold the asset group for continued use, the impairment test first requires a comparison of estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset group against its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated     undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group and its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset group. If the intent is to hold the asset group for sale and certain other criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the asset group s carrying value to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining the appropriate asset group level at which to test, determining whether a triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining estimated fair value.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, a definite-lived tradename intangible experienced a triggering event and was evaluated for impairment. Brand leadership changes during the year beyond the announced Company reorganizations, as well as market conditions particularly in print advertising, have resulted in a sustained decline in the brand's financial results. As a result of our evaluation, we wrote down the value of a domestic tradename intangible from its carrying value of   $250 million   to its fair value of   $65 million  , resulting in a pretax non-cash impairment charge of   $185 million  . 
  Intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following: 

_______________________ 
           (a) 
    Decrease in gross tradenames was the result of the non-cash domestic tradename impairment of   $185 million   recorded during the third quarter, partially offset by an increase due to acquisitions made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (b) 
    Increase in customer lists and other intangible assets was the result of acquisitions made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Other asset impairments for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $3 million   and   $4 million  , respectively, related to internally developed software assets. 
   
  2  .  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 
  Bizrate Acquisition 
  On September 6, 2016, we acquired Bizrate Insights Inc. ( Bizrate ), a consumer data company that specializes in developing consumer insights by extending its online and mobile surveys across partner sites. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, consideration transferred of   $78 million   (  $80 million   cash, net of settlement of a pre-existing relationship) was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.  
  At the acquisition date, the consideration transferred of   $78 million   assigned to the net assets acquired is summarized as follows:

We valued the merchant relationships using the excess earnings method, an income approach.   Under the excess earnings method, the fair value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the asset s projected incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated value of contributory assets (contributory charge) over its remaining useful life. Software assets were valued using the replacement cost approach. The replacement cost contemplates the cost to recreate the intangible asset. The tradename asset was valued using a relief from royalty approach, which is based on a hypothetical royalty that a market participant would otherwise be willing to pay to use the asset. Key unobservable inputs utilized in this valuation include the estimated cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset, a royalty rate of   4%  , a long-term growth rate of   3%  , useful lives of   3  -  7   years, and a discount rate of   17%  . Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Preliminary assumptions may change and may result in changes to the final valuation. 
  Viant Acquisition 
  On March 2, 2016, we, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired certain assets of Viant Technology Inc. ( Viant ), a business that specializes in data-driven, people-based marketing, headquartered in Irvine, California, for   $87 million  , net of cash acquired. With Viant s people-based marketing platform, we are combining our premium content, subscriber and visitor data, and advertising inventory with first-party data and targeting capabilities to bring substantial value to our advertisers. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets and identified intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.

In connection with the acquisition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $6 million   pretax   Bargain purchase (gain)   (  $3 million  , net of a deferred tax liability). We were able to realize a gain because Viant was in need of capital to continue its operations and was unable to secure sufficient capital in the time frame it required. We have assessed the identification of and valuation assumptions surrounding the assets acquired and the consideration transferred and have determined that the recognition of a bargain purchase gain is appropriate. The Company retained an independent third party to assist management in determining the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management. 
  For tax purposes, the   Bargain purchase (gain)   resulted in the reduction of the tax basis in identifiable intangibles, resulting in a deferred tax liability of   $3 million   being recorded on the opening balance sheet. This deferred tax liability reduced the   Bargain purchase (gain)  , and the   Bargain purchase (gain)   is not taxable. 
  Technology and database assets are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   seven   years, websites are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   five   years, customer relationships are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   five   years, and tradenames are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   ten   years. Acquired property and equipment will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated remaining useful lives. We valued the technology and database, customer relationships, and tradenames using variations of the income approach. The primary asset of Viant s business is the technology and database, which was valued as a single asset using the excess earnings method. Customer relationships and tradenames were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, and with and without method, respectively, all income approaches. Websites were valued using a replacement cost approach. 
  Key unobservable inputs utilized in this valuation include the estimated cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset, royalty rates of   0.5%   -   1%  , a long-term growth rate of   3%  , and a discount rate of   18%  . The Company valued the   Technology and database   using the excess earnings method, an income approach. In determining the fair value of this intangible asset, the excess earnings approach values the intangible asset at the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the asset after deducting contributory asset charges. The incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset are then discounted to their present value. Under the relief from royalty method, value is estimated by discounting the royalty savings as well as any tax benefits related to ownership to a present value. The with and without method assumes that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the difference between the present value of the prospective cash flows with the intangible asset in place and the present value of the prospective cash flows without the intangible asset in place.  Replacement cost contemplates the cost to recreate the intangible asset. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. 
  The carrying value for   Receivables   approximated their fair values. The uncollectible amount of   Receivables   is not expected to be significant.

Other Acquisitions 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we completed additional acquisitions for total cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of   $26 million  . Additional consideration may be required to be paid by us that primarily relates to earn-outs that are contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives by the end of 2017, which are estimated to be   $2 million  . The excess of the total consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired has been recorded as   Goodwill  . The fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are subject to change. Any changes in these fair values could potentially result in an adjustment to the   Goodwill   recorded for these transactions if such adjustments are within one year of the acquisition date. Our results of operations include the operations of these additional acquisitions from the date of the respective acquisitions but such activities were not significant for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In conjunction with one of these acquisitions, we also recognized a loss relating to a write off of an asset of   $3 million   previously recognized in our Financial Statements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that will not be realized as a result of the acquisition. This loss is reported within transaction costs in   Selling, general and administrative expenses   on the accompanying Statements of Operations. 
  Disposition 
  On April 1, 2016, we completed the sale of This Old House Ventures, LLC and This Old House Productions, LLC (together,  TOH ).  The assets and liabilities associated with TOH met the criteria for classification as Assets and Liabilities held for sale as of March 31, 2016. Upon disposal, assets of   $27 million   primarily related to   Goodwill  , and liabilities of   $10 million   primarily related to   Deferred revenue  , were derecognized from our Balance Sheets. We recognized a pretax gain of   $11 million   within   (Gain) loss on operating assets, net   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  3.  INVESTMENTS 
  Our investments included within   Short-term investments   and   Other assets   on the accompanying Balance Sheets consist primarily of short-term investments, equity-method investments and cost-method investments. Our investments, by category, consisted of the following (in millions): 

_______________________ 
           (a) 
    Our   Short-term investments   consist of term deposits with original maturities greater than   three months   and remaining maturities of less than   one year  . Our term deposits are carried at amortized cost on the accompanying Balance Sheets as held-to-maturity securities. 
              (b) 
    Our equity-method investments primarily consist of joint ventures. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made a   $6 million   investment in a digital content company. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded equity losses of   $1 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, primarily related to resuming applying the equity method after providing additional financial support to certain equity-method investees. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded equity losses of   $1 million   and   $8 million  , respectively. 
              (c) 
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we made a   $3 million   investment in a privately-held e-commerce subscription company. 
     We use available qualitative and quantitative information to evaluate all Cost-method investments for impairment at least quarterly.  
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did   no  t experience other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments.

4.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   
  A fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tiered hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on (i) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), (ii) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and (iii) unobservable inputs that require us to use present value and other valuation techniques in the determination of fair value (Level 3).  
  The following table presents information about assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (in millions): 

_______________________ 
           (a) 
    Contingent consideration, of which   $3 million   and   $6 million   is included in   Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   and   $4 million   and   $7 million   in   Other noncurrent liabilities   on the accompanying Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consists of earn-out liabilities in connection with acquisitions. Fair values were derived using a Monte Carlo simulation approach or a probability weighted present value of expected future payouts approach, which are considered Level 3 measurements. Adjustments to fair value of such obligations are included as a component of   Selling, general and administrative expenses   in the Statements of Operations. Such contingent considerations are primarily based on financial targets and other metrics.  
              (b) 
    Our other liabilities included within   Other noncurrent liabilities   on the accompanying Balance Sheets consist primarily of a put option liability related to an equity method investment, the fair value of which was derived using a lattice model which is considered a Level 3 measurement. Adjustments to fair value of this obligation are included as a component of   Other (income) expense, net   in the Statements of Operations. 
     The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balance of our liabilities classified as Level 3 (in millions):

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Other Financial Instruments 
  Our other financial instruments, including our term loan (the "Term Loan") and our   5.75%   senior notes (the "Senior Notes"), are not required to be carried on our Balance Sheets at fair value. However, the following table summarizes the fair value of each of our significant debt instruments based on quoted market prices for similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for instruments of the same remaining maturities (in millions): 

Our Term Loan and Senior Notes were originally issued at a discount of   $13 million   and   $10 million  , respectively. Such discounts are being amortized under the effective interest method over the respective terms of the debt instruments. The fair value of the outstanding debt instruments presented above is based on pricing from observable market information in a non-active market. Therefore, these debt instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in realization or expenditure of cash and generally are not recognized in the Financial Statements unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity. 
  The carrying value for the majority of our other financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the financial instruments. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to the market value of the instrument as quoted on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market. In case a quoted market value is not available, fair value is based on an estimate using present value or other valuation techniques. 
  Non-Financial Instruments  
  The majority of our non-financial instruments, which include   Goodwill  ,   Intangible assets, net  ,   Inventories, net of reserves   and   Property, plant and equipment, net  , are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur (or at least annually for   Goodwill  ) a non-financial instrument is required to be evaluated for impairment. If we were to determine that the non-financial instrument was impaired, we would be required to write down the non-financial instrument to its fair value. 
  Fair value measurements are also used in nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with acquisition accounting. The nonrecurring valuations primarily include the valuation of tradenames, customer and advertiser relationships, technology and database intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculation that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on assumptions. The valuation of customer and advertiser relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the relationships, considering such factors as estimated life of the relationships and the revenue expected to be generated over the life of such relationships. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering such factors as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we wrote down the carrying value of a definite-lived tradename intangible asset by   $185 million  . The valuation of this definite-lived intangible asset is also considered a Level 3 fair value measurement and employed assumptions on projected future cash flows from our long-range plans adjusted for current market trends, a risk-adjusted discount rate of   11%  , a growth rate of   1%   and a royalty rate of   5%  .

5.  DEBT 
  Our debt obligations consisted of the following (in millions): 

Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities 
  On April 29, 2014, we issued   $700 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.75%   Senior Notes due April 15,   2022   in a private offering. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and, under certain circumstances, may become guaranteed by other existing or future subsidiaries.   Interest payable on the Senior Notes   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $15 million   and   $8 million  , respectively. We made semi-annual interest payments on the Senior Notes of   $17 million   in both April and October   2016  . 
  On April 24, 2014, we entered into senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Credit Facilities") providing for a Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million   with a   seven  -year maturity and a   $500 million   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with a   five  -year maturity, of which up to   $100 million   is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Term Loan was funded on May 29, 2014. The Revolving Credit Facility remained undrawn as of   September 30, 2016   except for utilization for letters of credit in the face amount of   $2 million  . 
  All obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of Time Inc.'s assets and the assets of our guarantor subsidiaries under the Senior Credit Facilities, including a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of our subsidiaries directly held by Time Inc. or the guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities. All then-outstanding principal and interest under the Term Loan is due and payable on April 24, 2021. All then-outstanding principal and interest under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable, and all commitments thereunder will be terminated, on June 6, 2019. 
  We are permitted to prepay amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities at any time. Subject to certain exceptions, the Term Loan requires us to prepay amounts outstanding thereunder with the net cash proceeds of asset sales out of the ordinary course of business and casualty events if we do not use (or commit to use) such proceeds within   15   months of receipt to invest in our business, including, among other things, by acquiring, maintaining or developing assets useful in our business or making acquisitions permitted under the Senior Credit Facilities. We are required to make quarterly repayments of the Term Loan equal to   0.25%   of the aggregate original principal amount. Principal payments of   $5 million   were made on the Term Loan during both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interest payable on the Term Loan as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was insignificant.     Interest payments of   $22 million   and   $23 million   were made on the Term Loan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities, we originally incurred deferred financing costs of   $13 million  . The Term Loan was originally issued at a discount of   $13 million   and the Senior Notes were originally issued at a discount of   $10 million  . Debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the Term Loan and the Senior Notes, respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred amortization expense on deferred financing costs and discounts on indebtedness of   $1 million   and   $4 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we incurred amortization expense on deferred financing costs and discounts on indebtedness of   $1 million   and   $3 million  , respectively. 
  In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized discretionary principal debt repayments and/or repurchases of up to   $200 million   in the aggregate on our Term Loan and our   5.75%   Senior Notes. The authorization expires on December 31, 2017, subject to the extension or earlier termination by our Board of Directors. The extent to which we repay and/or repurchase our debt and the timing of such repayments and/or repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market and industry conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company from time to time. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. We have been financing, and expect to finance in the future, any such principal debt repayments and/or repurchases out of working capital and/or cash balances. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   $50 million   of the aggregate principal amount of our   5.75%   Senior Notes at a discount with accrued interest for a total of   $46 million   and recognized a pretax gain from extinguishment of   $4 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $75 million   remains unused under the authorization. 
   
  6.  INCOME TAXES 
  At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective income tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary year-to-date earnings. The income tax expense or benefit related to significant or unusual items that are separately reported, or reported net of their respective tax impact, are individually computed and recognized in the period in which they occur. The effect of changes in enacted tax laws, tax rates or tax status is recognized in the period in which such changes occur. 
  For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our Income tax   benefit   was   $73 million  . For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , our Income tax   benefit   was   $3 million   and our Income tax   provision   was   $4 million  , respectively. Our effective income tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   39%   and   41%  , respectively. Our effective income tax rate for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   nil  . 
  The change in the effective income tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the effect of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment recorded in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change in the effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the effect of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment recorded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  On October 13, 2016, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued final and temporary regulations addressing whether certain instruments between related parties are treated as debt or equity, as well as required documentation. We are currently evaluating the impact of these new regulations on our operations.

7.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
  In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of our common stock of up to   $300 million  . The authorization expires on December 31, 2017, subject to the extension or earlier termination by our Board of Directors. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase shares in open-market and/or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 and/or Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The extent to which we repurchase shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market and industry conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company from time to time. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. We have been financing, and expect to finance in the future, the purchases out of working capital and/or cash balances. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   7.33 million   shares of our common stock for a weighted average price of   $14.82   per common share. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $128 million   remains authorized for share repurchases. 
  On   November 3, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 30, 2016  , payable   December 15, 2016  . On   August 4, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   August 31, 2016  .

On   February 11, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   February 29, 2016  . A total of   $20 million   was paid on   March 15, 2016   in respect of the dividend declared on   February 11, 2016  . Our Board of Directors has consistently declared quarterly dividends of   $0.19   per common share since October 2014. We currently intend to continue to declare regular quarterly dividends on our outstanding common stock in respect of each completed fiscal quarter. The declaration and amount of any actual dividend is in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and is subject to numerous factors that ordinarily affect dividend policy, including the results of our operations and our financial position, as well as general economic and business conditions.

  Basic net income (loss) per common share   is calculated by dividing   Net income (loss)   attributable to Time Inc. common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.   Diluted net income (loss) per common share   is similarly calculated, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the assumed issuance of common shares issuable under equity-based compensation plans in accordance with the treasury stock method, except where the inclusion of such common shares would have an anti-dilutive impact. 
  The determination and reporting of net income (loss) per common share requires the inclusion of certain of our time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") where such securities have the right to share in dividends, if declared, equally with common stockholders. During periods in which we generate net income, such participating securities have the effect of diluting both basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to participating securities, since they do not share in the losses of the Company.

  Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units 
  The following table sets forth the number of Time Inc. stock options and RSUs granted for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

The Company adopted the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2016 Omnibus Plan ) in June 2016, which replaces and supersedes the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Omnibus Plan"). Awards granted under the 2014 Omnibus Plan remain in effect pursuant to their terms. Generally, stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, vest in   four   equal annual installments, and expire   ten   years from the date of grant. RSUs granted generally vest in   four   equal annual installments.      Upon the exercise of a stock option award, or vesting of an RSU, shares of Time Inc. common stock may be issued from authorized but unissued shares or treasury stock, if applicable. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any treasury stock. There were   no   Time Inc. stock options exercised during both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Approximately   1 million   RSUs vested into common shares during both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Outperformance Plan 
  On February 8, 2016, the Company adopted a long-term incentive outperformance program (the  Outperformance Plan ) under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. The Outperformance Plan is designed to incentivize and reward executive officers and a small number of key senior level executives for effecting the successful transformation of our business, as measured by the growth in our stock price over the next two years. Stock price performance under the Outperformance Plan is measured as the average closing price of our common stock from February 15, 2018 through March 15, 2018.  Under the plan, recipients will be rewarded for value creation measured in share price upon the vesting of the performance stock units ("PSUs"). 
  Threshold performance level was established at   $17   per share, representing a stock price increase of approximately   18%   from the February 8, 2016 grant date stock price of   $14.38  , and target performance level was established at   $20   per share. There is no payout at   $17  , but achievement and payouts are interpolated between   0%   and   100%   for performance between   $17   and   $20  .  The maximum performance level was established at   $26   per share. 
  The PSUs will vest on   March 15, 2018   with the payout of shares determined by the share price between February 15 and March 15, 2018. Each PSU represents the unfunded, unsecured right to receive   one   share of our common stock on the vesting date but carries no voting or dividend rights. PSUs generally are eligible to vest (based on the stock price at the end of the performance period) on a pro rata basis if an employee terminates before the end of the performance period due to death or disability. Non-vested PSUs are generally forfeited upon termination for any other reason. The expense related to these PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the incentive period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value and compensation expense of each PSU is determined on date of grant by using the Monte Carlo valuation model. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Time Inc. granted   1 million   PSUs, the compensation expense was   $1 million   and the income tax benefit related to these awards was   $1 million  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested Time Inc. PSUs as of   September 30, 2016  , without taking into account expected forfeitures, was   $4 million  . 
   
  10.  BENEFIT PLANS 
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
  We participate in various funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plans, including international plans in the United Kingdom, Germany and Benelux. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $12 million   to our international pension plans. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we contributed   $13 million   to our international pension plans. 
  Components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in millions):

     In connection with our exit from the Time and Life Building in November 2015, we entered into an agreement with the landlord which gave us an option to surrender certain floors for   $86 million  . We exercised this option and made the related payment in January 2016. Additionally, in March 2016, we negotiated a settlement and made the related payment to our landlord to settle our obligations for certain floors of another leased property for   $9 million   and reversed   $3 million   of restructuring expense.  As a result of these agreements, our minimum rental obligations were reduced by   $77 million  . These rental obligations were payable through 2017. 
  In July 2016, we announced an extensive realignment program that is intended to unify and centralize the editorial, advertising sales and brand development organizations. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $43 million   net   Restructuring and severance costs   primarily related to the July realignment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , of the remaining   $100 million   liability,   $89 million   was classified as a current liability in the Balance Sheets, with the remaining   $11 million   classified as a noncurrent liability. Amounts classified as noncurrent liabilities are expected to be paid through   2018   and relate to severance and lease exit costs. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we reversed   $1 million   of restructuring charges primarily due to headcount reductions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we reversed   $8 million   of restructuring charges due to both modifications to certain employee termination agreements and settlement of certain lease obligations. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we reversed   $4 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, of restructuring charges due to both modifications to certain employee termination agreements and settlement of certain lease obligations.

  Commitments 
  We have commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ("firm commitments") to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. Our commitments not recorded on the Balance Sheets primarily consist of operating lease arrangements, talent commitments and purchase obligations for goods and services. Our other commitments primarily consist of debt obligations. Our commitments have not significantly varied from those disclosed within our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  Legal Proceedings 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are defendants in or parties to various legal claims, actions and proceedings. These claims, actions and proceedings are at varying stages of investigation, arbitration or adjudication, and involve a variety of areas of law. 
  On March 10, 2009, Anderson News L.L.C. and Anderson Services L.L.C. (collectively, "Anderson News") filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  District Court ) against several magazine publishers, distributors and wholesalers, including Time Inc. and one of its subsidiaries, Time Inc. Retail (formerly Time/Warner Retail Sales   Marketing, Inc.) ("TIR"). Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by engaging in an antitrust conspiracy against Anderson News, as well as other related state law claims. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to reduce competition in the wholesale market for single-copy magazines by rejecting the magazine distribution surcharge proposed by Anderson News and another magazine wholesaler and refusing to distribute magazines to them. Plaintiffs are seeking (among other things) an unspecified award of treble monetary damages against defendants, jointly and severally. On August 2, 2010, the District Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and, on October 25, 2010, the District Court denied Anderson News' motion for reconsideration of that dismissal. On November 8, 2010, Anderson News appealed and, on April 3, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the  Circuit Court ) vacated the District Court's dismissal of the complaint and remanded the case to the District Court. On January 7, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied defendants' petition for writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court vacating the District Court's dismissal of the complaint. In February 2014, Time Inc. and several other defendants amended their answers to assert antitrust counterclaims against plaintiffs. On December 19, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on Anderson News' claims and Anderson News filed a motion for summary judgment on the antitrust counterclaim. On August 20, 2015, the District Court granted the defendants  motion for summary judgment on Anderson News  claims and granted Anderson News  motion for summary judgment on the defendants  antitrust counterclaim. On August 25, 2015, Anderson News filed a notice with the Circuit Court appealing the District Court s dismissal of Anderson News  claims, and on September 14, 2015, the defendants filed a notice with the Circuit Court appealing the District Court s dismissal of the defendants  antitrust counterclaim. On December 8, 2015, Anderson News filed its appellate brief with the Circuit Court and on March 8, 2016, the defendants filed their appellate briefs with the Circuit Court. Anderson s reply brief was filed on May 9, 2016 and the defendants  sur-reply brief was filed on May 23, 2016. Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for December 2, 2016 
  On November 14, 2011, TIR and several other magazine publishers and distributors filed a complaint in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware against Anderson Media Corporation, the parent company of Anderson News, and several Anderson News affiliates. Plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the Anderson News bankruptcy estate, seek to avoid and recover in excess of   $70 million   that they allege Anderson News transferred to the Anderson News-affiliated insider defendants in violation of the United States Bankruptcy Code and Delaware state law prior to the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against Anderson News by certain of its creditors. On December 28, 2011, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On June 5, 2012, the court denied defendants' motion. On November 6, 2013, the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay barring claims against the debtor, allowing Time Inc. and others to pursue an antitrust counterclaim against Anderson News in the antitrust action brought by Anderson News in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (described above).

On October 26, 2010, the Canadian Minister of National Revenue denied the claims by TIR for input tax credits in respect of goods and services tax that TIR had paid on magazines it imported into, and had displayed at retail locations in, Canada during the years 2006 to 2008, on the basis that TIR did not own those magazines, and issued Notices of Reassessment in the amount of approximately C  $52 million  . On January 21, 2011, TIR filed an objection to the Notices of Reassessment with the Chief of Appeals of the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA"), arguing that TIR claimed input tax credits only in respect of goods and services tax it actually paid and, regardless of whether its payment of the goods and services tax was appropriate or in error, it is entitled to a rebate for such payments. On September 13, 2013, TIR received Notices of Reassessment in the amount of C  $26.9 million   relating to the disallowance of input tax credits claimed by TIR for goods and services tax that TIR had paid on magazines it imported into, and had displayed at retail locations in, Canada during the years 2009 to 2010. On October 22, 2013, TIR filed an objection to the Notices of Reassessment received on September 13, 2013 with the Chief of Appeals of the CRA, asserting the same arguments made in the objection TIR filed on January 21, 2011. Beginning in 2015, the collections department of the CRA requested payment of both assessments plus accrued interest or the posting of sufficient security.  In each instance, TIR responded by stating that collection should remain stayed pending resolution of the issues raised by TIR s objection. On February 8, 2016, the Company filed an application for a remission order with the International Trade Policy Division of Finance Canada to seek relief from the assessments and the CRA s collection efforts.  On February 12, 2016, TIR filed a complaint with the Office of the Taxpayers  Ombudsman about the CRA s failure for more than five years to rule on TIR s objections to the reassessments. TIR requested that the Ombudsman Office recommend to the CRA that the reassessments be vacated or the CRA support TIR s application for a remission order.  On March 2, 2016, the CRA proposed that the Tax Court of Canada resolve the issue of whether TIR or the publishers are entitled to the input tax credits. On March 9, 2016, TIR agreed to the proposal. On May 6, 2016, TIR filed a Notice of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada of the assessments issued by the CRA and on July 25, 2016, the CRA filed a Reply to TIR's Notice of Appeal. The matter remains unresolved.  Including interest accrued on both reassessments, the total reassessment by the CRA for the years 2006 to 2010 was C  $91.1 million   as of November 30, 2015.  
  On October 3, 2012, Susan Fox filed a class action complaint (the "Complaint") against Time Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging violations of Michigan s Video Rental Privacy Act ( VRPA ) as well as claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The VRPA limits the ability of entities engaged in the business of selling, renting or lending retail books or other written materials from disclosing to third parties certain information about customers  purchase, lease or rental of those materials. The Complaint alleges that Time Inc. violated the VRPA by renting to third parties lists of subscribers to various Time Inc. magazines.  The Complaint sought injunctive relief and the greater of statutory damages of   $5,000   per class member or actual damages.  On December 3, 2012, Time Inc. moved to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds that it failed to state claims for relief and because the named plaintiff lacked standing because she suffered no injury from the alleged conduct.  On August 6, 2013, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, Time Inc. s motion, dismissing the breach of contract claim but allowing the VRPA and unjust enrichment claims to proceed.  On November 11, 2013, Rose Coulter-Owens replaced Susan Fox as the named plaintiff.  On March 13, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking to certify a class consisting of all Michigan residents who between March 31, 2009 and November 15, 2013 purchased a subscription to TIME, Fortune or Real Simple magazines through any website other than Time.com, Fortune.com and RealSimple.com.  On July 27, 2015, the court granted plaintiff s motion to certify the class, which we estimate to comprise approximately   40,000   consumers. On August 31, 2015, Time Inc. and the plaintiff moved for summary judgment and on October 1, 2015 both parties filed briefs in opposition to their adversaries  motions. On February 16, 2016, the court granted Time Inc.'s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On March 16, 2016, the plaintiff filed a notice with the Circuit Court appealing the District Court s dismissal of plaintiff s claims. On May 26, 2016, Time Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue her claims. Plaintiff filed her opposition brief on June 23, 2016 and Time Inc. filed its reply brief on July 12, 2016. On September 22, 2016, the Motions Part of the Circuit Court issued an order directing that Time Inc.'s motion to dismiss the appeal should be decided by the appellate panel that was assigned the plantiff's appeal on the merits. Pursuant to a new schedule set by the Court, the appellate briefs will be filed between November 4, 2016 and January 26, 2017. On February 19, 2016, the same law firm representing Coulter-Owens filed another class action, entitled Perlin v. Time Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging violations of the VRPA as well as a claim for unjust enrichment.  This lawsuit was filed on behalf of Michigan residents who purchased subscriptions directly from Time Inc. On May 6, 2016 and May 31, 2016, Time Inc. moved to dismiss the Complaint. Perlin filed an opposition brief on June 27, 2016 and Time Inc. filed

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

its reply brief on July 11, 2016. Oral argument was held on Time Inc.'s motion to dismiss on September 1, 2016. We are awaiting the Court's decision. 
  We intend to vigorously defend against or prosecute the matters described above. 
  We establish an accrued liability for specific matters, such as a legal claim, when we determine both that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. 
  For the matters disclosed above, we do not believe that any reasonably possible loss in excess of accrued liabilities would be material to the Financial Statements as a whole. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, claims and other matters, we often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of a pending matter will be, or what the timing or results of the ultimate resolution of a matter will be. 
  Income Tax Uncertainties 
  Our operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We believe we have appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and do not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Time Warner that may require us to indemnify Time Warner for certain tax liabilities for periods prior to the Spin-Off.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  
  Business Description    
  We generate revenues primarily from the sale of advertising in our magazines and through web-based advertising products and from magazine subscriptions and newsstand sales. We operate as one reportable segment and the majority of our revenues are generated in the United States. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated   Revenues   of   $2,209 million   (  a decrease   of   $17 million   from   $2,226 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ); Operating loss of   $120 million   (  an increase   of   $713 million   from Operating loss of   $833 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ); Net   loss   of   $104 million   (  an increase   of   $794 million   from a Net   loss   of   $898 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ); and Cash provided by operations of   $106 million   (  a decrease   of   $21 million   from   $127 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ). 
  Advertising, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose fluctuations can have a material effect on our operating results and cash flow. We have to anticipate the level of advertising, circulation and paper prices in managing our businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles.  
  We continue to experience declines in our print advertising and circulation revenues as a result of the continuing shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media, as well as growing consumer engagement with digital media on mobile devices and social platforms, which have introduced significant new competition. At the same time, the use of digital devices and applications as content distribution platforms has lowered the barriers to entry for introducing new products that compete with our businesses. We expect these trends to continue. Furthermore, our advertising and circulation revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions, economic cycles and evolving consumer preferences.  
  Additionally, as a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union ( Brexit ), global markets and foreign currencies have been adversely impacted. In particular, the value of the British Pound has sharply declined as compared to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. A weaker British Pound compared to the U.S. Dollar during a reporting period would cause local currency results of our United Kingdom ( U.K. )  operations to be translated into fewer U.S. Dollars.  This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the European Union, but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker British Pound compared to the U.S. Dollar could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Business Strategy  
  We are pursuing initiatives to help mitigate the declines in our print advertising and circulation revenues, including building audiences across our owned and operated websites as well as social platforms, and developing new ways to serve advertisers, including building native advertising and custom content solutions. In addition, we are developing data, targeting and measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers and for our consumer marketing efforts. The Viant acquisition enables us to target specific individuals and customize marketing messages on behalf of advertisers across devices with enhanced data. In addition, we are improving our operating efficiency through management of our cost structure. 
  On July 13, 2016, we announced an extensive realignment program that we expect will enable us to pursue incremental efficiency initiatives while accelerating the structural transformation of the Company. We believe the realignment will allow the organization to more efficiently work across all brands as "One Time Inc." and more effectively share resources and best practices across the organization. The changes affect three broad groups: Advertising Sales, Editorial and Brand Development. 
  We have developed strategies and initiatives intended to enhance the scale of our digital platforms and associated revenues, extend brands and audiences into new adjacent opportunities, enhance the alignment of our creative functions with our business requirements, and stabilize operating income trends. These initiatives include:

     Key Developments in 2016 
  Bizrate Acquisition 
  On September 6, 2016, we acquired Bizrate Insights Inc. ( Bizrate ), a consumer data company that specializes in developing consumer insights by extending its online and mobile surveys across partner sites. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, consideration transferred of $78 million ($80 million cash, net of settlement of a pre-existing relationship) was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. At the acquisition date, the consideration transferred of $78 million assigned to the net assets acquired is summarized as follows: 
                     In millions of dollars 
      
      Goodwill

We valued the merchant relationships using the excess earnings method, an income approach. Under the excess earnings method, the fair value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the asset s projected incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated value of

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

contributory assets (contributory charge) over its remaining useful life. Software assets were valued using the replacement cost approach. The replacement cost contemplates the cost to recreate the intangible asset. The tradename was valued using a relief from royalty approach, which is based on a hypothetical royalty that a market participant would otherwise be willing to pay to use the asset. Key unobservable inputs utilized in this valuation include the estimated cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset, a royalty rate of 4%, a long-term growth rate of 3%, useful lives of 3-7 years, and a discount rate of 17%. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Preliminary assumptions may change and may result in changes to the final valuation. 
  Viant Acquisition 
  On March 2, 2016, we, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired certain assets of Viant Technology Inc. ( Viant ), a business that specializes in data-driven, people-based marketing, headquartered in Irvine, California, for   $87 million  , net of cash acquired. With Viant s people-based marketing platform, we are combining our premium content, subscriber and visitor data, and advertising inventory with first-party data and targeting capabilities to bring substantial value to our advertisers. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets and identified intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. At the acquisition date, the purchase price assigned to the net assets acquired is summarized as follows: 
                     In millions of dollars 
      
      Receivables

      Total assets acquired

    93 

In connection with the acquisition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $6 million   pretax   Bargain purchase (gain)   (  $3 million  , net of a deferred tax liability). We were able to realize a gain because Viant was in need of capital to continue its operations and was unable to secure sufficient capital in the time frame it required. We have assessed the identification of and valuation assumptions surrounding the assets acquired and the consideration transferred and have determined that the recognition of a bargain purchase gain is appropriate. The Company retained an independent third party to assist management in determining the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management. 
  For tax purposes, the   Bargain purchase (gain)   resulted in the reduction of the tax basis in identifiable intangibles, resulting in a deferred tax liability of   $3 million   being recorded on the opening balance sheet. This deferred tax liability reduced the   Bargain purchase (gain)  , and the   Bargain purchase (gain)   is not taxable. 
  Technology and database assets are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   seven   years, websites are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   five   years, customer relationships are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   five   years, and tradenames are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of   ten   years. Acquired property and equipment will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated remaining useful lives. We valued the technology and database, customer relationships, and tradenames using variations of the income approach. The primary asset of Viant s business is the technology and database, which was valued as a single asset using the excess earnings method. Customer relationships and tradenames were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, and with and without method, respectively, all income approaches. Websites were valued using a replacement cost approach. 
  Key unobservable inputs utilized in this valuation include the estimated cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset, royalty rates of   0.5%   -   1%  , a long-term growth rate of   3%  , and a discount rate of   18%  . The Company  
  
   32 

    TIME INC. 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

valued the   Technology and database   using the excess earnings method, an income approach. In determining the fair value of this intangible asset, the excess earnings approach values the intangible asset at the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the asset after deducting contributory asset charges. The incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset are then discounted to their present value. Under the relief from royalty method, value is estimated by discounting the royalty savings as well as any tax benefits related to ownership to a present value. The with and without method assumes that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the difference between the present value of the prospective cash flows with the intangible asset in place and the present value of the prospective cash flows without the intangible asset in place. Replacement cost contemplates the cost to recreate the intangible asset. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. 
  The carrying value for   Receivables   approximated their fair values. The uncollectible amount of   Receivables   is not expected to be significant. 
  Other Acquisitions 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we completed additional acquisitions for total cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of   $26 million  . Additional consideration may be required to be paid by us that primarily relates to earn-outs that are contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives by the end of 2017, which are estimated to be   $2 million  . The excess of the total consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired has been recorded as   Goodwill  . The fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are subject to change. Any changes in these fair values could potentially result in an adjustment to the   Goodwill   recorded for these transactions if such adjustments are within one year of the acquisition date. Our results of operations include the operations of these additional acquisitions from the date of the respective acquisitions but such activities were not significant for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In conjunction with one of these acquisitions, we also recognized a loss relating to a write off of an asset of   $3 million   previously recognized in our Financial Statements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that will not be realized as a result of the acquisition. This loss is reported within transaction costs in   Selling, general and administrative expenses   on the accompanying Statements of Operations. 
  Disposition 
  On April 1, 2016, we completed the sale of This Old House Ventures, LLC and This Old House Productions, LLC (together,  TOH ).  The assets and liabilities associated with TOH met the criteria for classification as Assets and Liabilities held for sale as of March 31, 2016. Upon disposal, assets of   $27 million   primarily related to   Goodwill  , and liabilities of   $10 million   primarily related to   Deferred revenue  , were derecognized from our Balance Sheet. We recognized a pretax gain of   $11 million   within   (Gain) loss on operating assets, net   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Stock and Debt Repurchase Authorization 
  In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of our common stock of up to   $300 million   and principal debt repayments and/or repurchases of up to   $200 million   on both our term loan (the "Term Loan") and our   5.75%   senior notes (the "Senior Notes"). The authorization expires on December 31, 2017, subject to extension or earlier termination by the Board of Directors. Under the stock repurchase authorization, we may repurchase shares in open-market and/or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and repurchases may be executed pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Act. The extent to which we repurchase shares or repay our debt, and the timing of such transactions, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market and industry conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us from time to time. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. We have been financing, and expect to finance in the future, the purchases and repayments out of the working capital and/or cash balances. Shares repurchased are immediately retired. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased approximately   7.33 million   shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of   $14.82   per share. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,

we repurchased   $50 million   in aggregate principal amount of our   5.75%   Senior Notes at a discounted price together with accrued interest for a total of   $46 million  . As a result of the repurchase, we recognized a pretax gain on extinguishment of   $4 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $128 million   of share repurchases and   $75 million   of debt repayment and/or repurchases remained under the authorization. 
  Myspace Data Breach 
  In May 2016, our Viant subsidiary became aware that email addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords for approximately 360 million Myspace user accounts were being made available for sale online. Shortly thereafter, our Viant subsidiary engaged a computer forensics firm that specializes in investigating data breaches to investigate this potential data breach. Based on the forensic firm s analysis and review of all available data sources and systems, it appears that the breach most likely occurred at some point between June 2013 and mid-2015, although a more recent compromise cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty. As Myspace has already reported, it has sent a notice to all impacted users concerning the incident and is working proactively with law enforcement authorities. The Myspace breach did not affect any of Time Inc. s systems, subscriber information or other media properties and did not have any material impact on our business.

  (Gain) Loss on Non-operating Assets, Net 
  There were   no   gains or losses on non-operating assets during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In April 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in a U.K. joint venture to establish Look magazine as a consolidated division of our Time Inc. UK operations.

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the pretax gain on extinguishment was not significant. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a pretax gain on extinguishment of   $4 million  . There were   no   gains or losses on extinguishment of debt during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Gains and losses on extinguishment of debt are included in   Other (income) expense, net   on the accompanying Statements of Operations. 
  Other Items Affecting Comparability 
  In addition to the items described above, the following items affected comparability of results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
             
    Real Estate Related  : We completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin building during the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, depreciation expense   decreased     $8 million   and   $28 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to 2015 as we accelerated the depreciation on our tenant improvements at our former New York City headquarters at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in 2015 in anticipation of relocating at the end of 2015. We also recognized less depreciation expense in 2016 related to the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building, partially offset by increased depreciation related to our new headquarters at 225 Liberty Street. Additionally, rent expense decreased   $11 million   and   $30 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to 2015 as we no longer have duplicate rent for our New York City facilities as we completed the exit from our former headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by rent expense in the first quarter of 2016 related to the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building. 
                
    Equity Method Losses  : We had suspended recognizing equity losses for certain equity method investments during 2015 as our investee losses were in excess of the investments' carrying amounts. During the   three and nine months

ended September 30, 2016  , we provided additional financial support to these equity-method investees and recognized   $1 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, in equity losses related to these fundings. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Statements of Operations. 
  Geographic Concentration of Revenues 
  A majority of our   Revenues   have been generated in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom. For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   87%   of our   Revenues   were generated in the United States and   10%   of our   Revenues   were generated in the United Kingdom. For both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   86%   of our   Revenues   were generated in the United States, and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   11%   and   12%   of our   Revenues   were generated in the United Kingdom, respectively. We expect the majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in the United States for the foreseeable future.  
  Seasonality 
  Our quarterly performance typically reflects moderate seasonal fluctuations. Advertising revenues from our magazines and websites are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year due to higher consumer spending activity and corresponding higher advertiser demand to reach our audiences during this period. 
  Results of Operations   Three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three months ended September 30, 2015

The following table presents our   Revenues  , by type, as a percentage of total revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Advertising Revenues 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Advertising   revenues   increased     5%   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in   Advertising   revenues was driven by a   63%     increase   in our   Digital advertising   revenues primarily resulting from the Viant acquisition and to a lesser extent growth in   Digital advertising   revenues relating to programmatic sales. This   increase   in   Digital advertising   revenues in   2016   as compared to   2015   reflects the investments we have made in digital advertising products including people-based targeting across devices with enhanced data, and native advertising capabilities. Partially offsetting the   increase   in our   Digital advertising   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was a   10%     decrease   in our   Print and other advertising   revenues. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound adversely impacted   Advertising   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by $5 million. 
  The decline in print magazine advertising revenues was attributable to fewer advertising pages sold primarily resulting from the continuing trend of advertisers shifting advertising spending from print to other media, and by lower average price per page of advertising sold. These were partially offset by a benefit of   $10 million   related to certain advertising revenues being recognized on a gross basis in 2016 that had been recognized on a net basis in 2015. As compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , our domestic titles experienced advertising declines, with particular weakness in the technology/telecommunications, automotive and fashion/retail categories. We expect the adverse market conditions associated with our   Print and other advertising   revenues to continue. However, we are pursuing strategies to benefit from the growth of our mobile audiences, including building native advertising and custom content solutions for advertisers. The Viant acquisition enables us to provide advertisers with people-based ad target capabilities across devices. We continue to invest in video to participate in the shift of advertising dollars into digital video.

Circulation Revenues 
  The components of   Circulation   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in millions): 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Circulation   revenues   decreased     15%   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to lower domestic   Subscription   revenues and a decline in both domestic and international   Newsstand   revenues.   Circulation   revenues also declined $5 million as a result of the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound adversely impacted   Circulation   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by $8 million. The decline in   Circulation   revenues was primarily due to the continued shift in consumer preferences from print to digital media. We expect the market conditions associated with our   Circulation   revenues to continue. 
  Other Revenues  
  Other   revenues, which include marketing and support services provided to third parties, branded book publishing, events, and licensing,   decreased     4%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , to   $110 million   primarily due to a decline from branded book publishing.

    Costs of revenues   and   Selling, general and administrative expenses   set forth above exclude depreciation. 
     Costs of Revenues  
  Costs of revenues   consist of costs related to the production of magazines and books, editorial costs, as well as other costs.   Production costs   include paper, printing and distribution costs. A variety of factors affect paper prices and availability, including demand, capacity, raw material and energy costs and general economic conditions. Our current paper supply arrangements are based on an annual request-for-proposal process establishing a non-binding pricing framework for the year. Price and volume adjustments are negotiated from time to time under this pricing framework, typically on a quarterly basis. The bulk of our U.S. printing occurs under multi-year contracts with a single printer. The Board of Governors of the USPS reviews prices for mailing services annually and periodically adjusts postage rates for each class of mail, including periodicals. Although prices and price increases for various USPS products vary, overall average price increases generally are capped by law at the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Effective May 31, 2015, rates for all classes of mail were increased by approximately   2%   by the Postal Regulatory Commission. In April 2016, the USPS announced a   4.3%   rate decrease for all classes of mail as a result of the removal of the exigent surcharge that was imposed in December 2013, effective April 10, 2016. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Costs of revenues     increased     5%   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .   Production costs     decreased     8%   primarily due to lower paper prices and volume, and a reduction in postage rates.   Editorial costs     increased   as a result of growth initiatives and digital investments, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings initiatives.   Other   costs of revenues   increased     $29 million   or   69%   as compared to the prior year primarily driven by costs of operations of acquired businesses as well as   $10 million   of costs that were reported net in   Print and other advertising   revenues in 2015 that are now included in   Other   costs of revenues in 2016. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound favorably impacted   Costs of revenues   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   by $6 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , SG A   decreased     9%   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Included in SG A for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $2 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, of other costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments and dispositions ("transaction costs"). The decrease in SG A was primarily driven by the benefits realized from previously announced cost savings initiatives, including real estate, and noncash losses recognized in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   in connection with the settlement of a domestic excess pension plan. These decreases were partially offset by the costs of operations of acquired businesses and expenses related to growth initiatives. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound benefited SG A by $6 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Asset Impairments 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized   Asset impairments   of   $188 million   primarily related to an impairment of a domestic tradename intangible. There were   no   such charges during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Goodwill Impairment 
  There was   no     Goodwill impairment   charge during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized a noncash   Goodwill impairment   charge of   $952 million  .  
  Restructuring and Severance Costs  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   Restructuring and severance costs   of   $43 million   and   $8 million  , respectively.   Restructuring and severance costs   in   2016     increased   primarily due to the realignment program to unify and centralize the editorial, advertising sales and brand development organizations. 
  Depreciation 
  Depreciation expense was   $14 million   and   $22 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   $8 million   decrease reflects accelerated depreciation in 2015 of assets at our former headquarters at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in anticipation of relocating at the end of 2015, as well as less depreciation expense in 2016 related to the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building in the fourth quarter of 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation related to our new headquarters at 225 Liberty Street. 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  Amortization of intangible assets was   $22 million   and   $21 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  (Gain) Loss on Operating Assets, Net 
  The Gain on operating assets, net of   $2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the recognition of the deferred gain from the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building in the fourth quarter of 2015. There were   no   gains or losses on the sale of operating assets during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Operating Income (Loss) 
  Operating   loss   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $167 million  . Operating   loss   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was   $899 million  . 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net   was   $16 million   and   $19 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest income for both the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was insignificant. The   decrease   in   Interest expense, net   was driven by lower debt outstanding due to repurchases.

  Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Income tax   benefit   was   $73 million   and   $3 million  , respectively. Our effective income tax rate was   39%   and   nil   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the effect of the non-deductible Goodwill impairment recorded in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Net income (loss)   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a Net   loss   of   $112 million   and   $913 million  , respectively.

The following table presents our   Revenues  , by type, as a percentage of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Advertising Revenues 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Advertising   revenues   increased     3%   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in   Advertising   revenues was driven by a   51%     increase   in our   Digital advertising   revenues primarily resulting from the Viant acquisition and to a lesser extent growth related to programmatic sales. Partially offsetting the   increase   in our   Digital advertising   revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a   9%     decrease   in our   Print and other advertising   revenues primarily due to a decline in domestic print advertising revenues. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound adversely impacted   Advertising   revenues by $8 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The decline in print magazine advertising revenues was attributable to fewer advertising pages sold primarily resulting from the continuing trend of advertisers shifting advertising spending from print to other media, and by lower average price per page of advertising sold. These were partially offset by a benefit of   $23 million   related to certain advertising revenues being recognized on a gross basis in 2016 that had been recognized on a net basis in 2015. As compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , our domestic titles experienced advertising declines in the beauty, fashion/retail and technology/telecommunications categories. We expect the adverse market conditions associated with our   Print and other advertising   revenues to continue. However, we are pursuing strategies to benefit from the growth of our mobile audiences including building native advertising and custom content solutions for advertisers. The Viant acquisition enables us to provide advertisers with people-based ad target capabilities across devices. We continue to invest in video to participate in the shift of advertising dollars into digital video. 
  Circulation Revenues 
  The components of   Circulation   revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   are as follows (in millions): 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Circulation   revenues   decreased     9%   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to lower domestic and international   Subscription   revenues and lower domestic and international   Newsstand   revenues. Circulation revenues also declined $12 million due to the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound adversely impacted   Circulation   revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by $14 million. The decline in   Circulation   revenues was primarily due to the continued shift in consumer preference from print to digital media. We expect the market conditions associated with our   Circulation   revenues to continue.

  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Costs of revenues     increased     9%     as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Production costs     decreased     5%   due to favorable paper and printing costs, a lower volume of pages produced and lower distribution costs.   Editorial costs     increased   primarily as a result of growth initiatives and digital investments, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings initiatives and lower editorial costs related to branded book publishing.   Other   costs of revenues   increased     $95 million   or   106%   as compared to the prior year primarily driven by costs of operations of acquired businesses as well as   $23 million   of costs that were reported in   Print and other advertising   revenues in 2015 that are now included in   Other   costs of revenue in 2016. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound favorably impacted   Costs of revenues   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by $11 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , SG A   decreased   by   3%   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Included in SG A for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $23 million   and   $5 million  , respectively, of transaction costs. Transaction costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related in part to payments made to certain vendors of the Viant business in order to continue receiving services from such vendors. The other components of SG A decreased by $40 million primarily driven by benefits realized from previously announced costs savings initiatives, including real estate, and noncash losses recognized in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   in connection with the settlement of a domestic excess pension plan. These decreases were partially offset by the costs of operations of acquired businesses and an increase in expenses related to growth initiatives. The stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound benefited SG A by $10 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Asset Impairments 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized Asset impairment charges of   $189 million   primarily related to an impairment of  a domestic tradename intangible. There were   no   such charges during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Goodwill Impairment 
  There was   no     Goodwill impairment   charge during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized a noncash   Goodwill impairment   charge of   $952 million  .  
  Restructuring and Severance Costs  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred   Restructuring and severance costs   of   $54 million   and   $22 million  , respectively.   Restructuring and severance costs   in   2016   primarily due to the realignment program to unify and centralize the editorial, advertising sales and brand development organizations.   Restructuring and severance costs   in   2015   primarily related to headcount reductions and settlement of certain real estate obligations. 
  Depreciation 
  Depreciation expense was   $41 million   and   $69 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   $28 million     decrease   reflects accelerated depreciation in   2015   of assets at our former headquarters at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in anticipation of relocating at the end of   2015  , as well as less depreciation expense in   2016   related to the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building in the fourth quarter of   2015  , partially offset by increased depreciation related to our new headquarters at 225 Liberty Street. 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  Amortization of intangible assets was   $63 million   and   $60 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   increase   in amortization expense was primarily the result of newly acquired intangible assets. 
  (Gain) Loss on Operating Assets, Net 
  Gain on operating assets, net of   $18 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily related to a gain on sale of TOH of   $11 million   and the recognition of the deferred gain of $7 million from the sale-leaseback of the Blue Fin Building in the fourth quarter of 2015. There were   no   gains or losses on the sale of operating assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Operating Income (Loss) 
  Operating   loss   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $120 million   as compared to Operating   loss   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $833 million  .

  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net   was   $51 million   and   $58 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest income for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was insignificant. The   decrease   in   Interest expense, net   was driven by lower debt outstanding due to repurchases. 
  Other (Income) Expense, Net 
  Other (income) expense, net   was expense of   $9 million   and   $3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and primarily consisted of losses on equity method investments, partially offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt. 
  Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Income tax   benefit   was   $73 million   and our Income tax   provision   was   $4 million  , respectively. Our effective income tax rate was   41%   and   nil   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change in the effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the non-deductible Goodwill impairment recorded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Net income (loss)   was a Net   loss   of   $104 million   and   $898 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
  Our operations have historically generated positive net cash flow from operating activities. Sources of cash primarily include cash flow from operations, amounts available under our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and access to capital markets. Our access to additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions, including the absence of any event or circumstance having a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the obligation of the financial institutions under our Revolving Credit Facility are several and not joint, and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond markets. However, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including (i) our financial condition, prospects and credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on favorable terms or at all. As of   September 30, 2016  , total   Cash and cash equivalents   were   $244 million  , including $56 million held by foreign subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , we also held   Short-term investments   consisting of term deposits of   $60 million   with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year. 
  The principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and capital expenditures; acquisitions; dividends and stock repurchases; debt repurchases and debt service costs, including interest and principal payments on our Senior Notes and senior credit facilities (the "Senior Credit Facilities"); investments; and income tax payments. Of the up to   $300 million   of stock repurchases and   $200 million   for debt repayments and/or repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors,   $128 million   and   $75 million  , respectively, remains unused as of   September 30, 2016  . We have been financing, and expect to finance in the future, repurchases under our 2015 share repurchase authorization and fund debt repayments and/or repurchases out of working capital and/or cash balances.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of other securities or the assumption of indebtedness. In accordance with the provisions of our debt agreements, we may under certain circumstances be required to use the net cash proceeds of asset sales out of the ordinary course of business to prepay our debt unless we invest (or commit to invest) such proceeds in our business within 15 months of receipt. 
  On   November 3, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 30, 2016  , payable   December 15, 2016  . On   August 4, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   August 31, 2016  . A total of   $19 million   was paid on   September 15, 2016   in respect of the dividend declared on   August 4, 2016  . On   May 5, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   May 31, 2016  . A total of   $19 million   was paid on   June 15, 2016   in respect of the dividend declared on   May 5, 2016  . On   February 11, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.19   per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   February 29, 2016  . A total of   $20 million   was paid on   March 15, 2016   in respect of the dividend declared on   February 11, 2016  . Our Board of Directors has consistently declared quarterly dividends of   $0.19   per common share since October 2014. We currently intend to continue to declare regular quarterly dividends on our outstanding common stock in respect of each completed fiscal quarter. The declaration and amount of any actual dividend are in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and are subject to numerous factors that ordinarily affect dividend policy, including the results of our operations and our financial position, as well as general economic and business conditions.  
  We believe that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, along with our funding and investment requirements over the next twelve months and over the long-term. 
  Our level of debt could have important consequences on our business, including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. In addition, economic or market disruptions could lead to a decrease in demand for our services, such as lower levels of advertising. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As of   September 30, 2016  , the only utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility was letters of credit in the face amount of   $2 million  . Subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, undrawn revolver commitments are available to be drawn for our general corporate purposes. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of the filing of this quarterly report. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Cash and cash equivalents     decreased   by   $407 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the year ended   December 31, 2015  ; and   decreased     $254   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to the year ended   December 31, 2014  .

   The decrease in Cash provided by operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily reflects the buyouts of the leases at our former corporate headquarters and another leased property for $95 million, partially offset by lower cash rent expense and lower bonus payments.

Investing Activities  
  Details of   Cash provided by (used in) investing activities   are as follows (in millions): 

The decrease in Cash used in investing activities primarily reflects lower capital spending in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to the completion of the relocation of our corporate headquarters and other properties in 2015. 
  Financing Activities  
  Details of   Cash provided by (used in) financing activities   are as follows (in millions): 

The increase in Cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily associated with repurchases under our 2015 share and debt repurchase authorizations.

    a Term Loan in an initial principal amount of   $700 million   with a   seven  -year maturity; and  
                
    a   $500 million   Revolving Credit Facility with a five-year maturity, of which up to   $100 million   is available for the issuance of letters of credit. 
     The proceeds from the Senior Notes and the Term Loan were used to fund the purchase of our Time Inc. U.K. operations (the "Time Inc. UK Purchase") from Time Warner and to pay Time Warner a special dividend. The credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities permits us to incur incremental senior secured term loan borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in an aggregate principal amount not

    TIME INC. 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

to exceed the sum of   $500 million  . The credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities also allows us to incur additional incremental senior secured term loans in unlimited amounts (beyond the   $500 million  ) so long as, on a pro forma basis at the time of incurrence, our consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities) does not exceed   2.50  x to   1.00  x. However, no lender is under any obligation to make any such incremental senior secured term loans to us. 
  We are permitted to prepay amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty. Under certain circumstances, the Term Loan may require us to prepay amounts outstanding thereunder with the net cash proceeds of asset sales out of the ordinary course of business and casualty events if we do not use (or commit to use) such proceeds within 15 months of receipt to invest in our business, including, among other things, by acquiring, maintaining or developing assets useful in our business or making acquisitions permitted under the Senior Credit Facilities. We are required to make quarterly repayments of the Term Loan equal to   0.25%   of the aggregate original principal amount. All then-outstanding principal and interest under the Term Loan is due and payable on April 24, 2021. All then-outstanding principal and interest under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable, and all commitments thereunder will be terminated, on June 6, 2019. 
  On or after April 15, 2017, we may redeem the Senior Notes at a premium that will start at   4.313%   and decrease over time to   zero  . Prior to April 15, 2017, we may redeem the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount thereof plus a customary  make-whole  premium. In addition, until April 15, 2017, we may redeem up to   40%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to   105.75%   of the principal amount thereof with the proceeds of certain equity offerings. In the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes), the holders of the Senior Notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the principal amount of such Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Notes mature in April   2022  . 
  The indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell preferred or mandatorily redeemable stock; to pay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock; to make investments or acquisitions; to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; to allow liens to exist on our assets; to enter into sale/leaseback transactions; to consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries  assets; or to enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These limitations restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations. With respect to the Revolving Credit Facility only, we are required to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities) not to exceed   2.75  x to   1.00  x, as tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with all provisions of our debt agreements as of the filing of this Form 10-Q. 
  Our Board of Directors has authorized discretionary principal debt repayments and/or repurchases of up to   $200 million   in the aggregate on our Term Loan and our   5.75%   Senior Notes. The authorization expires on December 31, 2017, subject to the extension or earlier termination by our Board of Directors. The extent to which we repay and/or repurchase our debt and the timing of such repayments and/or repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market and industry conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us from time to time. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. We have been financing, and expect to finance in the future, such principal debt repayments and/or repurchases out of working capital and/or cash balances. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   $50 million   in aggregate principal of our   5.75%   Senior Notes at a discount with accrued interest for a total of   $46 million   and recognized a pretax gain on extinguishment of   $4 million  . 
  The foregoing description of the Senior Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities is only an overview. We also refer you to the form of indenture for the Senior Notes and the credit agreement for the Senior Credit Facilities that have been filed as exhibits to our Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2014.

Contractual and Other Obligations  
  Contractual Obligations  
  In addition to the financing arrangements discussed above, we have obligations under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual obligations secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, the future rights and obligations pertaining to certain firm commitments, such as operating lease obligations and certain purchase obligations under contracts, are not reflected as assets or liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets. Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   are not significantly different from those disclosed within our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Contingencies 
  We are defendants in or parties to various legal claims, actions and proceedings. These claims, actions and proceedings are at varying stages of investigation, arbitration or adjudication, and involve a variety of areas of law. See to Note   12  , "Commitments and Contingencies" to the accompanying Financial Statements. 
  Income Tax Uncertainties 
  Our operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We believe we have appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and do not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Tax Matters Agreement with Time Warner that requires us to indemnify Time Warner for certain tax liabilities for periods prior to the Spin-Off.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We have exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk. We neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  The following sections provide quantitative and qualitative information on our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. We make use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We conduct operations in three principal currencies: the U.S. dollar; the British pound sterling; and the Euro. These currencies primarily serve as the functional currency for our U.S., U.K. and European operations, respectively. Cash is managed centrally within each of these regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital and/or overdraft facilities. We generally do not hedge our investments in the net assets of our U.K. and European operations. 
  To manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, we may enter into foreign currency contracts from time to time with financial institutions to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
  Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the results of our operations. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities' statements of earnings and balance sheets from each functional currency to our reporting currency (the U.S. dollar) for consolidation purposes. We do not hedge translation risk because we typically generate positive cash flows from our international operations that are typically reinvested locally. The currency exchange rates with the most significant impact on translation are the British pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Euro. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years. 
  As a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union ( Brexit ), global markets and foreign currencies have been volatile. In particular, the value of the British pound has sharply declined as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies.  This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the European Union but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur.   
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate Senior Notes of   $561 million   was   less than   their carrying value of   $567 million   by   $6 million  . The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for comparable securities and consideration of our risk profile. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at   September 30, 2016   would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately   $21 million   to approximately   $582 million  .  
  Our Term Loan is subject to variable interest rates but includes a eurocurrency "floor" that is higher than the corresponding market rate currently prevailing. As such, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in current interest rates will not have a material impact on our annual interest expense. A hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately   $10 million  . The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to variable interest rates but is assumed to be undrawn for purposes of this calculation. Our Revolving Credit Facility remained undrawn as of the date of filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, except for   $2 million   in letters of credit issued thereunder. 
    
  The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans is determined by using a spot-rate yield curve, derived from the yields available on high quality corporate bonds. Broad equity and bond indices are used in the determination of the expected long-term rate of return on our non-U.S. pension plan assets. Therefore,  
  
   53 

interest rate fluctuations and volatility of the debt and equity markets can have a significant impact on asset values of our non-U.S. pension plans and future anticipated contributions. For example, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates generally would decrease our benefit obligations under our non-U.S. pension plans by approximately $122 million. 
  Credit Risk 
  Cash and cash equivalents   are maintained with several financial institutions as well as invested in certain high quality money market mutual funds and term deposits. Insurance with respect to deposits held with banks is limited to an insignificant amount of such deposits. However, our bank deposits generally may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. 
  There is also limited credit risk with respect to the money market mutual funds and term deposits in which we invest as these investments all have issuers, guarantors and/or other counterparties of reputable credit.  
  Our receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold. 
  We monitor our positions and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 
  Other Market Risk 
  We continue to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. Paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. Our expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper. The cost of raw materials, of which paper expense is a major component, represents approximately   5%   of our total annual operating costs. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed and submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  Except as described below, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On March 2, 2016, we completed the Viant acquisition. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this event. We plan to exclude this acquisition from the scope of our annual report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended   December 31, 2016  , as permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. We are in the process of integrating the Viant business into our overall internal control over financial reporting process and plan to include it in scope for the year ended December 31, 2017. This process may result in additions or changes to our internal control over financial reporting.

Richard Battista 
  95 Apple Tree Lane 
  New Canaan, CT 06840 

Dear Rich, 
    
  We have discussed the possibility of your being offered and becoming President and Chief Executive Officer of Time Inc., subject to the parties reaching agreement on mutually acceptable terms.   
    
  The following sets forth the terms and conditions which Time Inc. is prepared to provide in connection with your appointment to such position by action of the Board of Directors.  All of these terms and conditions are subject to the execution of a definitive employment agreement between you and the company.  Such agreement will have a three-year term, and will supersede your existing employment agreement with the company.   
    
  As President and Chief Executive Officer, you would report directly to the Board of Directors and you will be the most senior operating executive of the company.  In connection with your appointment to such positions, effective upon the execution of your new employment agreement, the Board of Directors would elect you as a member of the Board of Directors, and the company will commit in your agreement to continue to nominate you for election to the Board during your continued tenure as President and Chief Executive Officer.   

Your annual base salary will be increased to be   $1,200,000  , effective upon signing the definitive employment agreement  .  

You will be eligible to participate in the company s annual incentive bonus plan, with a target bonus opportunity of   150%   of base salary.  Bonus payments will be subject to the terms of our annual bonus plan, except as expressly set forth herein.   

Together with your annual base salary, this enhanced target bonus opportunity will provide you with a total target annual cash compensation opportunity of $  3,000,000.    For 2016, your base salary and bonus percentage will be prorated such that your existing employment terms will apply for the period prior to the date of your new employment agreement is executed, and your new base salary and bonus percentage will apply for the period after such date. 

You will be entitled to participate in our annual long-term equity award program with a target incentive value of   $3,000,000.    The annual equity awards would be made 50% in performance share units for 2017, and somewhere between 50% and 66.7% in performance share units as determined by the Compensation Committee for subsequent years, with the remainder of the grant value divided approximately equally between stock options and restricted stock unit awards and subject only to time vesting.  Consistent with generally applicable practices, actual grants will be determined by the Compensation Committee based on     this target, subject to adjustment to reflect     your performance and that of the company, including its share price and such other factors as the Compensation Committee shall deem pertinent.  Your enhanced annual equity awards will be made at the same time as grants are generally made to other executives (generally in February of each calendar year), and subject to standard equity plan vesting and other terms, except as expressly set forth herein.   

With respect to the 2017 opportunity, one half of your annual award will be granted at the same time as the 2016 Special Grant described below (the  Accelerated 2017 Grant ).  The Accelerated 2017 Grant will be comprised of options in respect of 200,000 shares, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, and that number of restricted stock units having a value at the date of grant of $750,000.  Each  
     
   1 

component of the Accelerated 2017 Grant will be subject to our standard equity plan vesting and other terms, except as expressly set forth herein. 

You will receive a one-time special equity award as soon as practicable following execution of your new employment agreement (the  2016 Special Grant ).  The 2016 Special Grant will be comprised of options in respect of 200,000 shares, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, and that number of restricted stock units having value at the date of grant of $750,000.  Each component of the 2016 Special Grant will be subject to our standard equity plan vesting and other terms, except as expressly set forth herein.  

You will be granted an additional Outperformance Plan ( OPP ) opportunity of $3,000,000 at target (target defined as $22/share of Time Inc. stock price) to bring your total target OPP to $  5,000,000  .  Except as otherwise provided below, this additional $3,000,000 opportunity (the  Incremental OPP Opportunity ) will be subject to and substantially consistent with the company s standard grant practices with respect to the OPP as denoted in your current award agreements except as set forth herein.  The terms of your previously granted opportunity under the OPP will remain unchanged. 

Notwithstanding the company s standard practices, vesting of the 2016 Special Grant and the Accelerated 2017 Grant will accelerate in full and vesting of the Incremental OPP Opportunity will accelerate to the extent that the stock price performance hurdles are achieved, in each case, upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined under the company s applicable equity incentive plan (a  Change in Control ). 

In the event that your employment is involuntarily terminated by the company without cause or by you due to a material breach of your agreement by the company or other good reasons (a  Qualifying Termination ), you will receive severance equal to the salary and bonus that you would have received had you continued to work for an additional 24 months.  In the event of a Qualifying Termination prior to the payment of your annual bonus for your services in 2018 (which will be payable on or before March 15, 2019), the bonus component of your severance would be determined based on your target annual bonus opportunity, in lieu of applying your  average actual bonus.   Such average actual bonus will apply to any such Qualifying Termination occurring after payment of the 2018 annual bonus.  Your severance benefits will not be subject to any duty to mitigate damages or (except as provided in the next bullet) any offset in respect of amounts earned from other activities following your termination. 
     
   2 

As an additional severance benefit, in the event of any Qualifying Termination, the company will either pay your cost of COBRA coverage or reimburse you for such COBRA coverage for you and your eligible dependents any period that you are eligible to elect such coverage by reason of such Qualifying Termination (e.g., such benefit will cease if you become eligible for coverage by reason of employment under another group health plan).   
                
    Notwithstanding the payment provisions applicable to severance contained in the company s standard employment agreement, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, in the event that you suffer a Qualifying Termination within 12 months following a Change in Control, the severance benefits payable under your employment agreement will be payable to you in a single lump sum.  In any other circumstances, the standard payment provisions will apply. 

Additionally, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, you will be permitted to vest in the 2016 Special Grant, the 2017 Accelerated Grant and any other equity award granted after 2016 to the same extent, and at the same time, as you would otherwise have become vested in any such award had your employment continued for the 24-month period following your termination (including, in the case of any award the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of any performance objectives, the satisfaction of the applicable performance objectives).  If you incur a Qualifying Termination prior to the conclusion of the applicable measurement date of the Incremental OPP Opportunity, you will become vested in the Incremental OPP Opportunity to the same extent as though you were employed at such measurement date. 

Recognizing that the change in your position and the associated increase in your contingent award opportunities resulting therefrom is reasonably likely to result in a significant short-term disparity between your historical compensation and your available compensation opportunities, in the event of a change in control of the company occurring prior to the second anniversary of the execution of your revised employment agreement (the  Second Anniversary Date ), the company will provide you with an excise tax gross-up related to any golden parachute excise tax that you incur by reason of such change in control.  In the event that any such change in control occurs after the Second Anniversary Date, you will be subject to a  best net  provision, such that your compensation will be limited to the amount that can be paid to you without the imposition of any such excise tax, if so doing will result in your receiving a better after tax result than if no such limitation were applied.  In no event shall any excise tax gross-up payment be provided with respect to any change in control occurring after the Second Anniversary Date. 

The revised employment agreement will contain the same provisions regarding limitations on your ability to compete with the company during and following your employment that are reflected in your current employment agreement, and also will contain provisions giving you the right to be indemnified by the company (including without limitation the advance of expenses) to the maximum extent permissible for actions taken during your service for the company.   

You will be reimbursed for your legal fees and costs incurred in connection with the negotiation of the employment agreement and any other related agreements up to a maximum amount of $25,000 in the aggregate.  
       If you indicate your agreement to accept the appointment as the company s President and Chief Executive Officer on the terms and conditions outlined above (including without limitation subject to the execution of a mutually-approved definitive employment agreement), your appointment will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval.

I have great confidence that your leadership will create a mutually beneficial relationship for the company and its stockholders, customers and employees.   
    
  Sincerely,

  Dear Rich: 
  You and Time Inc. (the "Company") are parties to an employment agreement dated March   5,   2015 (the "Prior Agreement").  In connection with your appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer, this agreement supersedes such Prior Agreement and will serve to confirm our discussions concerning the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and from and after the date hereof, will constitute our agreement ("Agreement"):  
  1.  Term of Employment.    Except for earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof, the term of employment under this Agreement ("Term of Employment") will commence on September 13, 2016 ("Effective Date") and will continue thereafter until September 30, 2019.  Your employment with the Company upon the expiration of this Agreement shall be at-will if no new or amended employment agreement is in place between the parties at that time. 
  2.  Employment.    During the Term of Employment, the Company will employ you as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  You shall report directly to the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company and you will be the most senior operating executive of the Company.  You shall have the authority, functions, duties, powers and responsibilities normally associated with such position as well as such additional authority, functions, duties, powers and responsibilities as may be assigned to you from time to time consistent with your position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. You will devote substantially all of your business time, attention, skill and efforts to the performance of your duties hereunder and will faithfully and diligently serve the Company. You may manage your passive investments and be involved in charitable, religious, and civic interests so long as they do not materially interfere with the performance of your duties hereunder, and so long as they do not otherwise violate the written policies of the Company. In performing your duties hereunder, you will comply with all written policies and procedures of the Company. Without your prior written consent, your principal place of business shall not be more than 50 miles from Manhattan, New York. 
  3.  Compensation and Other Remuneration. 
  3.1      Base Salary.    During the Term of Employment, the Company will pay to you a base salary at the rate of not less than $1,200,000 per annum (the "Base Salary"), which the Company  

may increase, but not decrease. The increase in such rate of base salary effected by this Agreement shall take effect at the Effective Date.  Base Salary will be paid in accordance with the   customary payroll practices of the Company and shall be subject to payroll deductions and required withholdings. 
  3.2      Bonuses and Long Term Incentives. 
  (a)  For each year during the Term of Employment, you shall be eligible to participate in the Company's annual incentive plan ("AIP  "  ) to the extent you are eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of such plan.  Your bonus target is 150% of Base Salary earned in the applicable bonus year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of your 2016 services, your annual bonus with respect to your services performed and base salary payable prior to the Effective Date shall be determined by applying the target bonus percentage specified in the Prior Agreement to such base salary, and with respect to your services performed and base salary payable in 2016 on and after the Effective Date applying the target bonus percentage specified herein to the base salary payable from and after the Effective Date. 
  (b)  Each year, the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board ("Compensation Committee") will determine, in their sole discretion, whether to grant long term incentive awards. For each year during the Term of Employment, you shall be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards with an annual long term incentive target value is $3,000,000 (which shall be applied based on the same valuation method used by the Company for awards to its senior executives, as the same may be effect from time to time)   at the same time as annual awards are made to other senior executives of the Company.  Consistent with generally applicable practices, actual grants will be determined by the Compensation Committee based on     this target, subject to adjustment to reflect     your performance and that of the Company, including its share price, and such other factors as the Compensation Committee shall deem pertinent.  Long term incentive compensation awards (i) in respect of your 2017 long-term incentive award opportunity will be made 50% in performance share units, with the remainder of the grant value in respect of 2017 divided approximately equally between stock options and restricted stock unit awards and subject only to time vesting (the   "  2017 Time Vested Awards  "  ), and (ii) awards in respect of subsequent years during the Term of Employment shall be made between 50% and 66.7% in performance share units, as determined by the Compensation Committee, with the remainder of the grant value in respect of any such year divided approximately equally between stock options and restricted stock unit awards that are subject only to time vesting.  All grants are subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
  (c)  Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, you shall be awarded (i) options in respect of 400,000 shares of the Company s common stock, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, and (ii) that number of restricted stock units having a value at the date of grant of $1,500,000.  One half of the options and restricted stock units subject to the grant made hereby shall constitute a one-time special equity award made in connection with your promotion (the   "  2016 Special Grant  "  ) and the other half shall be treated as an accelerated grant of the 2017 Time Vested Awards (the   "  Accelerated 2017 Grant  "  ).  Except as specified below, the terms and conditions of the 2016 Special Grant and the Accelerated 2017 Grant will be generally consistent with the terms and conditions applicable to the Company s grants of similar types of awards made to executive officers in respect of 2016 annual awards, except that it is agreed that the 2016 Special Grant and the Accelerated 2017 Grant shall be subject only to time (and not performance) vesting. 
  (d)  Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, you shall be awarded an additional outperformance plan (  "  OPP  "  ) opportunity with a projected value, based on the  

methodology applied generally in the granting of such of awards, of $3,000,000 (the   "I  ncremental OPP Opportunity  "  ).  Except as provided below, the terms and conditions of the Incremental OPP Opportunity will be generally consistent with the terms and conditions applicable to the Company s grants of similar types of awards to executive officers in 2016.    
  (e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(c) or 3(d), vesting of the 2016 Special Grant and the Accelerated 2017 Grant will accelerate in full, and vesting of the Incremental OPP Opportunity will accelerate to the extent that the stock price performance hurdles are achieved, in each case, upon the occurrence of a change in control (a   "  Change in Control  "  ) as defined under the Company s 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  
  (f)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(c) or 3(d), in the event that your employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason, as each term is defined in Section 5 below (either such termination, a   "  Qualifying Termination  "  ), you will be permitted to vest in the 2016 Special Grant, the 2017 Accelerated Grant and any other equity award granted to you after the Effective Date to the same extent, and at the same time, as you would otherwise have become vested in any such award had your employment continued for the 24-month period following your termination of employment (subject, in the case of any award the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of any performance objectives, the satisfaction of the applicable performance objectives).  If you incur a Qualifying Termination prior to the conclusion of the applicable measurement date of the Incremental OPP Opportunity, you will become vested in the Incremental OPP Opportunity to the same extent as though you were employed at such measurement date. 
  4.  Benefits.   You will be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of the Company, whether now existing or established hereafter, to the extent that you are eligible under the general provisions thereof as in effect from time to time. 
  5.  Termination. 
  5.1      Termination for Cause. 
  (a)    The Company may terminate your employment during the Term of Employment and all of the Company's obligations hereunder, other than its obligations set forth below in this Section 5.1 at any time for "Cause." "Cause" shall mean termination because of your (a) conviction (treating a nolo contendere plea as a conviction) of a felony (whether or not any right to appeal has been or may be exercised) other than as a result of a Limited Vicarious Liability (as defined below), (b) willful failure or refusal without proper cause to perform any of your material duties with the Company, including your material obligations under this Agreement (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental impairment), (c) misappropriation, embezzlement or reckless or willful destruction of Company property, (d) breach of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company other than an unintentional breach that would not reasonably be expected to have any significant affect on the financial condition, operation or reputation of the Company or any of its affiliates, (e) intentional and improper conduct materially prejudicial to the business of the Company or any of its affiliates, or (f) material breach of any of the covenants provided for in Section 6 hereof. Any termination by the Company for Cause shall be effected by written notice thereof delivered by the Company to you and shall be effective as of the date of such notice; provided, however, that if such termination is because of (i) your willful failure or refusal without proper cause to perform your material duties with the Company or (ii) a breach of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or a material breach of any of the covenants provided for in Section 6, and you cure such failure or refusal or such breach, if such action is reasonably susceptible of cure, promptly and in any event not more than thirty (30) days following the date of such notice, the  

termination effected by such notice shall not be effective.  To the extent you have the opportunity to cure a failure, refusal or breach in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may, in its discretion, simultaneously with or following the delivery of such termination notice place you on an administrative leave for up to thirty (30) days, without pay, and during which it may suspend your duties and responsibilities hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, any action related to such administrative leave shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of any of the Company s duties to you under this Agreement and shall not constitute Good Reason for you terminate your employment, so long as it fully reinstates you and promptly pays any missed compensation payments, should you effect a cure thereof that results in such termination for Cause not being effective.  For purposes of this definition of Cause, no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be considered   "  willful  "   or   "  intentional  "   unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that such action or omission was opposed to the best interest of the Company.  The term   "  Limited Vicarious Liability  "   shall mean any liability which is based on acts of the Company for which you are responsible solely as a result of your office(s) with the Company; provided that (1) you are not directly involved in such acts and either had no prior knowledge of such intended actions or, upon obtaining such knowledge, promptly acted reasonably and in good faith to attempt to prevent the acts causing such liability, or (2) after consulting with the Company s counsel, you reasonably believed that no law was being violated by such acts. 
  (b)    In the event of the termination of your employment by the Company for Cause, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law or in equity, the Company shall have no further obligations to you other than to: (i) pay Base Salary and unused vacation accrued in accordance with Company policy through the effective date of termination, (ii) pay unreimbursed business expenses incurred before the effective date of your termination of employment in accordance with Company policy; and (iii) comply with obligations owed under the Company's benefit plans in accordance with their terms as in effect as of the effective date of termination ((i) through (iii) collectively, the "Termination Entitlement")). 
  5.2      Termination Due to Death.    This Agreement shall terminate upon your death and the Company shall not have any further obligations hereunder, except that your estate will be entitled to receive, in addition to any regular life insurance benefits paid by the Company, the Termination Entitlement. 
  5.3      Termination Due to Disability  .  If during the Term of Employment you become physically or mentally disabled, whether totally or partially, so that you are prevented from performing the material functions of your position for periods aggregating six (6) months in any twelve (12) month period, the Company will be entitled to terminate the Term of Employment upon written notice to you given at any time thereafter during which you are still disabled.  You will thereafter be entitled to receive, in addition to the Termination Entitlement (subject to the requirements of Section 5.9) for the greater of the remainder of the original Term of Employment or twelve (12) months, bi-weekly payments made in substantially equal installments in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company, and subject to payroll deductions and required withholdings at an annualized rate equal to the sum of your Base Salary and "Average Annual Bonus" (as defined below), but reduced on a monthly basis by an amount equal to the disability payments received for such month by you from Workers' Compensation, Social Security and disability insurance policies maintained by the Company or its affiliate: provided. however, that all payments under this Section 5.3 shall cease upon the earlier of: (i) your commencing substantially full-time employment, or (ii) you ceasing to be eligible for long-term disability benefits under the Company's or an affiliate's long-term disability plan or becoming eligible only for partial benefits of less than fifty percent (50%) under such plan.  Upon the termination of payments made pursuant to this Section 5.3, your disability payments, if any, will be determined in  

accordance with the Company's long-term disability program then in effect, and no further payments will be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  All payments made under this Section 5.3 after the date of termination of employment are intended to be disability payments, regardless of the manner in which they are computed.  For all purposes of this Agreement, "Average Annual Bonus" shall be defined as an amount equal to the average of the two (2) highest Bonus amounts received by you before the effective date of your termination (excluding any special, spot or long term incentive plan bonuses) for the most recent three (3) completed Bonus plan years at the Company; provided, that, if your  employment terminates prior to the payment of your annual bonus for your services in 2018 (which will be payable on or before March 15, 2019), then in any instance where you would be entitled to receive an amount equal to or based upon the Average Annual Bonus, you shall receive $1,800,000 in lieu of such Average Annual Bonus.  
  5.4      Other Termination by the Company. 
  (a)    The Company may terminate your employment during the Term of Employment, other than a termination under Sections 5.1, 5.2. or 5.3, at any time upon written notice to you.  In the event that your employment is so terminated, in addition to the Termination Entitlement, you will receive (subject to the requirements of Section 5.9), for the duration of the Severance Period (defined in Section 5.4(b) below), bi-weekly payments made in substantially equal installments in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company, and subject to payroll deductions and required withholdings, at an annualized rate equal to the sum of your then Base Salary and Average Annual Bonus; provided however, that: 
  (i)  if you die during the Severance Period. your payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall cease, and your estate will be entitled to receive, in addition to any regular life insurance benefits paid by the Company, any payments due pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) through the date of your death; 
  (ii)  if you accept benefits-eligible employment with any other corporation, partnership. trust, government or other entity during the Severance Period (notice of such employment to be provided to the Company within ten (10) business days) or otherwise notify the Company in writing of your intention to terminate your benefits during the Severance Period, then you will continue to receive all payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a). but shall cease to receive any applicable post-termination benefits described in Section 5.4(c) below, effective upon the commencement of such employment or the effective date of such termination as specified by you in your notice of intention to terminate benefits;  
  (iii)  in the event that you suffer a Qualifying Termination within 12 months following a Change in Control, the severance benefits payable under your employment agreement will be payable to you in a single lump sum within 70 days of the date of such termination of employment; and 
  (iv)  if you accept employment with the Company or an affiliated entity during the Severance Period, your payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall cease effective the first date of employment with such related or affiliated entity. 
  (b)    The "Severance Period  "   shall be 24 months. 
  (c)    During the Severance Period, unless prohibited by law, (i) you will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company's life insurance plans on the same terms and conditions as regular full-time employees and (ii) the Company will either pay your cost of COBRA  

coverage or reimburse you for such COBRA coverage for you and your eligible dependents in respect of any period that you are eligible to elect such coverage by reason of such Qualifying Termination.  During the Severance Period, you will not be entitled to any additional awards or grants under any equity plan or other long-term incentive plan or to continue elective deferrals in or accrue additional benefits under the Company's 401(k) plan or any other qualified or nonqualified retirement programs maintained by the Company. 
  (d)    If the Company terminates your employment during the Term of Employment pursuant to this Section 5.4, provided that you have participated in the AIP for  at least six months of the applicable fiscal year, you will receive an additional severance payment in lieu of  an AIP bonus payment in the  amount of  what you would have earned under the AIP if your employment had not terminated, calculated using a prorated target based on the number of days you were employed during the plan year, a strategic rating of 100% and actual Company/Division financial performance.  This severance payment will be paid at the same time AIP bonus payments for the applicable plan year are made to active employees. 
  (e)  In the event that the Company terminates the Term of Employment pursuant to this Section 5.4 or you terminate your employment for Good Reason under Section 5.5, you shall not be required to take actions in order to mitigate your damages hereunder and the Company shall have no right to offset against any amounts that you are entitled to receive under this Agreement any amounts that you earn or receive after the termination of your employment.  Any payments or rights to which you are entitled by reason of the termination of employment without cause shall be considered as liquidated damages hereunder. 
  (f)  If the Company does not offer to renew this Agreement upon expiration of the Term of Employment, and your employment is subsequently terminated by the Company for a reason other than Cause or by you for Good Reason (as described in Section 5.5 below), such termination will be treated as a termination pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, except that the "Severance Period" shall be 12 months, and you will be subject to the requirements of Sections 5.9 and 6. 
  5.5      Termination Due to Good Reason.    You will have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company, to terminate your employment for Good Reason effective thirty (30) days after the giving of notice that an event, occurrence or breach constituting Good Reason shall have occurred.  Good Reason shall exist if the Company, during the Term of Employment, shall without your prior written consent (i) reduce your base salary or your target bonus opportunity; (ii) remove you from the position of President or Chief Executive Officer, (iii) materially reduce your duties, responsibilities and authorities from those that are in effect on the Effective Date; (iv) move the Company s headquarters more than 50 miles outside of Manhattan; (v) fail, during the Term of Employment, to have nominated you for re-election as a member of the Board, which failure results in your ceasing to be a member of the Board, or (vi) otherwise be in material breach of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that you shall not have Good Reason unless you provide written notice of any such event, occurrence or breach to the Company within ninety (90) days after the initial occurrence thereof; and provided further that you shall not have Good Reason to terminate your employment if within the thirty (30)-day notice period referenced above the Company shall have cured any such occurrence, event or breach.  If the action giving rise to your right to terminate your employment for Good Reason has not been so cured, you may elect, subject to the requirements of Section 5.9, to terminate your employment for Good Reason, in which case such termination shall be treated as though a termination of the Term of Employment by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4 above, and you shall be entitled to the rights and benefits provided for in Section 5.4 as and when due thereunder. 

5.6      Resignation or Retirement.    You may terminate the Term of Employment for any reason, including, without limitation your retirement, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Company.  If you terminate your employment for any reason other than for Good Reason, the Company's only obligation to you will be payment of the Termination Entitlement. In any instance in which you provide written notice of your termination of the Term of Employment to the Company, the Company may elect to terminate your employment immediately, in which case the Company's only obligation to you will be payment of the Termination Entitlement, treating the last day of the notice period as the date of termination solely for purposes of calculating the Termination Entitlement. In no event will the Company's early termination of your employment pursuant to the preceding sentence be considered a termination of the Term of Employment by the Company under Section 5.4 and in no event shall the Company's early termination of you pursuant to the preceding sentence require the Company to provide the Termination Entitlement for any greater period than the period beginning on the date your written notice of termination is received by the Company and ending sixty (60) days thereafter. 
  5.7      Effect of Qualifying Termination Upon Right in Respect of Certain Equity Awards.    As provided in Section 3.2(f), in the event your employment is terminated due to a Qualifying Termination, you will be permitted to vest in the 2016 Special Grant, the 2017 Accelerated Grant and any other equity award granted after the Effective Date to the same extent, and at the same time, as you would otherwise have become vested in any such award had your employment continued for the 24-month period following your termination (but subject, in the case of any award the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of any performance objectives, to the satisfaction of the applicable performance objectives).  If, prior to the applicable measurement date of the Incremental OPP Opportunity, your employment is terminated in a Qualifying Termination, you will become vested in the Incremental OPP Opportunity to the same extent as though you were employed at such measurement date. 
  5.8      Resignation from the Board  .  If requested by the Board, you shall resign as a member of the Board upon your termination of employment with the Company and its affiliates, regardless of the reason for such termination.   
  5.9       Release.

You acknowledge that the Company has a compelling business interest in preventing unfair competition stemming from the use or disclosure of confidential client information, including but not limited to the identity of clients and prospective clients ("Client Information"), in the event that. after any termination of your employment with the Company, you go to work for or become affiliated with a competitor of the Company or otherwise engage in business activities that are competitive with those of the Company. You further acknowledge that   all   clients serviced by you as an executive of the Company are clients of the Company and not yours personally,   and that   by virtue of your employment with the Company, you have gained or will gain knowledge of   the   identity, characteristics, and preferences of clients, and that you would inevitably have to draw on Client Information if you were to solicit or service the Company's clients or contact prospective clients on behalf of a competing business enterprise.

You acknowledge that, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing, all of the foregoing shall be owned by and belong exclusively to the Company and that you will have no personal interest therein, provided that they are, in the case of Work Product, conceived or made on the Company's time or with the use of the Company's facilities or materials, or, in the case of business opportunities, are presented to you for the possible interest or participation of the Company.

  9.      Golden Parachute Provisions  .   
  (a)      Gross-Up in Respect of a Change in Control Within Two Years of the Effective Date.      If, prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date (the   "  Second Anniversary Date  "  ), there shall occur a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, in any such case, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the   "  Code  "  ) 

(any such change in ownership, effective control or assets hereafter called a   "  280G Change in Control  "  ),  and  any amount or benefit paid or distributed to you pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to you by the Company or any affiliated company (collectively, the   "  Covered Payments  "  ), are or become subject to the tax (the   "  Excise Tax  "  ) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code or any successor provision thereto, the Company shall pay you at the time specified below an additional amount (the   "  Tax Reimbursement Payment  "  ) such that the net amount retained by you with respect to such Covered Payments and the Tax Reimbursement Payment, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income and employment tax and Excise Tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section 9, but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments. The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) shall be paid to you not later than 10 business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to you by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered Payment.  In the event that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to you, payable on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).  In no event shall the Tax Reimbursement Payment be made later than the time specified in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v). 
  (b)      Best Net Provision Applicable Following Second Anniversary Date  .  In the event that any 280G Change in Control occurs after the Second Anniversary Date, you will be subject to a   "  best net  "   provision, such that your compensation and benefits that would otherwise constitute   "  parachute payments  "   under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code will be limited to the largest amount that can be paid to you without the imposition of any such excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, if so doing will result in your receiving a better (i.e. higher) after tax result than if no such limitation were applied.  In no event shall any excise tax gross-up payment be provided with respect to any 280G Change in Control occurring after the Second Anniversary Date.  If the determination made in this Section 9(b) above results in a reduction of the payments that would  otherwise be paid to you except for the application of the preceding sentence, such reduction in payments shall be first applied to reduce any cash severance payments that you would otherwise be entitled to receive hereunder, in reverse order of the date the severance payments would otherwise be received, and shall thereafter be applied to reduce other payments and benefits in a manner that would not result in subjecting you to additional taxation under Section 409A of the Code. 
  (c)      Calculation Provisions  .  (i)  For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, 
           (A) 
    such Covered Payments will be treated as   "  parachute payments  "   within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all   "  parachute payments  "   in excess of the   "  base amount  "   (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company s independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the change in ownership or control or tax counsel  

selected by such Accountants that is acceptable to you (the   "  Accountants  "  ), whose fees shall be paid by the Company, it is more likely than not such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute   "  parachute payments  "   or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) prior to the date of the change in ownership or control in excess of the   "  base amount  "  , or such   "  parachute payments  "   are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and 
           (B) 
    the value of any non cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.   
       (ii)    For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, you shall be deemed to pay: 
           (A) 
    Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made (determined without regard to Section 409A, unless the Accountants shall determine that any amount is also subject to the incremental tax applicable thereunder), and 
              (B) 
    any applicable state and local income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.   
     (iii)    In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, you shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to you, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed interest received or credited to you by such tax authority for the period it held such portion.  You shall have no obligation to file a claim for a refund or credit with the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority.  If you file a claim for a refund with the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority and your claim for refund or credit is denied, you and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) after your good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.  In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.

In such event, the Company may, at its option, seek and obtain from any court having jurisdiction, injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to pursuing at arbitration all other remedies available to it (including without limitation any claims for relief arising out of any breach of Section 6 or 7 of this Agreement). In the event that the Company chooses to bring any such suit, proceeding or action for injunctive or equitable relief in an appropriate court, you hereby waive your right, if any, to trial by jury, and hereby waive your right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever and agree to arbitrate any and all such claims. 
  10.8      Specific Remedy.   In addition to such other rights and remedies as the Company may have at equity or in law with respect to any breach of this Agreement, if you commit a material breach of any of the provisions of Sections 6 or 7, the Company will have the right and remedy to have such provisions specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company.

If a court should determine that any provision of this Agreement is overbroad or unreasonable, such provision shall be  

given effect to the maximum extent possible by narrowing or enforcing in part that aspect of the provision found overbroad or unreasonable.

To the extent that payments and benefits in this Agreement are subject to Section 409A of the Code, this Agreement is intended to comply with and will be interpreted in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of your termination of employment with the Company you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to you) until the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code). On the first day of the seventh month following the date of your separation from service, or if earlier, the date of your death, (x) all payments delayed pursuant to this paragraph (whether they would have otherwise been paid or reimbursed to you in a single sum or in installments) shall be paid or reimbursed to you in a single sum and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal dates specified for them in this Agreement. In addition, if any other payments of money or other benefits due to you hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Company, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to you under this Agreement constitute "deferred compensation  "   under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to you in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). Each payment   made under   this Agreement shall be designated as a "separate payment" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. References herein to a termination of your employment shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which you have experienced a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A. The Company shall consult with you in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 10.13; provided that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to you with respect thereto. 
  10.14      No Offset.   Neither you nor the Company shall have any right to offset any amounts owed by one party hereunder against amounts owed or claimed to be owed to such party, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and you and the Company shall make all the payments provided for in this Agreement in a timely manner. 

10.15      Survival.   Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive any termination of the Term of Employment pursuant to Section 5 and any expiration of this Agreement and shall apply for the duration of employment and beyond in accordance with their terms. 
  10.16      Legal fees  .  You shall be reimbursed for your reasonable, out-of-pocket legal fees incurred in connection with the negotiation of the employment agreement and any other related agreements up to a maximum amount of $25,000 in the aggregate. 
  10.17      Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of which shall constitute one original instrument. 
  10.18      Interpretation.   The parties to this Agreement have cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement. Hence, in any construction or interpretation of this   Agreement, the same shall not be construed against any party on the basis that such party was the drafter.    If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding between you and the Company, please sign and date below and return this Agreement to the Company.

   3 

vest will be reduced to the extent such reduction results in a greater net after tax benefit to the Grantee and the Change in Control date shall be the Vesting Date for that portion of the Award that vests. 
           c) 
    Requirement of Continuous Employment  .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 5, the vesting of RSUs under this Agreement and any Retained Distributions relating thereto shall occur only if the Grantee s Employment has continued from the Date of Grant through the Vesting Date.

    RSUs Extinguished  .  Upon each issuance or transfer of Shares in accordance with this Agreement, a number of RSUs equal to the number of Shares issued or transferred to the Grantee shall be extinguished and such number of RSUs will not be considered to be held by the Grantee for any purpose. 
              e) 
    Final Issuance  .  Shares issued or transferred upon vesting of the RSUs shall be issued in whole Shares.  Upon the final issuance or transfer of Shares and Retained Distributions, if any, to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement, in lieu of a fractional Share, the Grantee shall receive a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share. 
              f)

              5. 
    Termination of Employment  .  If the Grantee s Employment terminates for any reason (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Grantee is providing services) prior to the Vesting Date with respect to any portion of the Award, then except as otherwise provided in the Separation from Service Addendum or an employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company or an Affiliate, the RSUs covered by any such portion of the Award and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination. 
              6. 
    Responsibility for Taxes; Compliance with Laws; Incorporation of Plan Terms  . 
              a) 
    Obligation to Pay Withholding Taxes  .  The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action taken or failed to be taken by the Company or, if different, the Grantee s employer (the      Employer     ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and payment on account or other tax-related items related to Grantee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Grantee (the    Tax-Related Items   ), is and remains the Grantee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Grantee further agrees and acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the  
     
   4 

Award, the vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement, the receipt of any dividends, and the receipt of any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.   
  The Company s obligation to deliver the Shares subject to the RSUs and the Company s obligation, if any, to pay any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions shall be subject to payment of all Tax-Related Items by the Grantee.   
           b) 
    Satisfaction of Company s Withholding Obligations  .  No later than any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items due as a result of such taxable or tax withholding event.  In this regard, Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: 
              (i) 
    by requiring the Grantee to deliver a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to sell a sufficient number of Shares to generate net proceeds (after commission and fees) equal to the Tax-Related Items and promptly deliver such amount to the Company; 
              (ii) 
    by requiring or allowing the Grantee to pay the Tax-Related Items in cash or by check;  
              (iii) 
    by deducting the Tax-Related Items from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and/or the Employer;  
              (iv) 
    for U.S. Grantees, by allowing the Grantee to surrender other Shares that (A) in the case of Shares initially acquired from the Company (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), have been owned by the Grantee for such period (if any) as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company s earnings, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the Tax-Related Items; 
              (v) 
    by withholding a number of Shares to be issued upon delivery of Shares that have a Fair Market Value equal to the Tax-Related Items;  
              (vi) 
    by selling any Shares (on the Grantee s behalf pursuant to this authorization) to the extent required to pay the Tax-Related Items; or 
     
   5 

(vii) 
    by such other means or method as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Grantee deems appropriate; 
     provided  ,   however  , that if the Grantee is a Section 16 officer of the Company, within the meaning of the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods above. 
  Depending on the withholding method, the Company shall withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering (x) applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other withholding rates if withholding is in Shares or (y) if withholding is not in Shares but by another means, other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Grantee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 
  The Company may satisfy its obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items on Dividend Equivalents, and Retained Distributions (in each case, to the extent payable pursuant to Section 3) by withholding a sufficient amount from the payment or by such other means as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Grantee deems appropriate, including withholding from salary or other amounts payable to the Grantee, Shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items.   
  The Company will not issue any Shares, or pay any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions to the Grantee unless and until the Grantee satisfies its obligations for Tax-Related Items. 
           c) 
    Compliance with Applicable Laws  .  The Committee may also require the Grantee to acknowledge that he or she shall not sell or transfer Shares except in compliance with all applicable securities and exchange control laws, and may apply such other restrictions on the sale or transfer of the Shares as it deems appropriate. 
              d) 
    Changes in Capitalization and Government and Other Regulations  .  The Award shall be subject to all of the terms and     provisions as provided in this Agreement and in the Plan, which are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 4 of the Plan (generally relating to adjustments to the number of Shares subject to the Award, upon certain changes in capitalization and certain reorganizations and other transactions).   
     
   6 

7. 
    Forfeiture; Waiver  .  A breach of any of the foregoing restrictions or a breach of any of the other restrictions, terms and conditions of the Plan or this Agreement, with respect to any of the RSUs or any Dividend Equivalents and Retained Distributions relating thereto, except as waived by the Board or the Committee, will cause a forfeiture of such RSUs and any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions relating thereto.  The Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by the Grantee or any other grantee. 
              8. 
    Right of Company to Terminate Employment  .  Nothing contained in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer on the Grantee any right to continued Employment and the Company and any of its Affiliates shall have the right to terminate the Employment of the Grantee at any such time, with or without Cause, notwithstanding the fact that some or all of the RSUs and related Retained Distributions covered by this Agreement may be forfeited as a result of such termination.  The granting of the RSUs under this Agreement shall not confer on the Grantee any right to any future Awards under the Plan. 
              9. 
    Notices  .  Any notice which either party hereto may be required or permitted to give the other shall be in writing and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, addressed to Time Inc., at 225 Liberty Street, New York, NY 10281, attention Stock Plan Administration and to the Grantee at his or her address, as it is shown on the records of the Company or its Affiliate, or in either case to such other address as the Company or the Grantee, as the case may be, by notice to the other may designate in writing from time to time. 
              10. 
    Interpretation and Amendments  .  The Committee has plenary authority to interpret this Agreement and the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating thereto and to make all other determinations in connection with the administration of the Plan.  The Committee may from time to time modify or amend this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
              11. 
    Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Grantee and his or her legatees, distributees and personal representatives. 
              12. 
    Copy of the Plan and Documents  .  By accepting this Award, the Grantee agrees and acknowledges that he or she has received and had an opportunity to read a copy of the Plan.  The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Grantee may be entitled from time to time to receive certain other documents related to the Company, including the Company s annual report to Shareholders and proxy statement related to its annual meeting of Shareholders (which become available each year approximately three months after the end of the calendar year), and the Grantee consents to receive such documents electronically through the Internet or as the Company otherwise directs. 
              13. 
    Governing Law  .  The Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any choice of law rules thereof which might apply the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Grantee is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Grantee s country may apply to the Grantee s situation. 
  If the Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Grantee is currently residing and/or working (or if the Grantee is considered as such for local law purposes) or if the Grantee moves to another country after receiving the grant of the RSUs, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Grantee in the same manner.

Further, if the Grantee is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

    Satisfaction of Company s Withholding Obligations  .  No later than any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items due as a result of such taxable or tax withholding event.  In this regard, Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:

    by requiring or allowing the Grantee to pay the Tax-Related Items in cash or by check;  
              (iii) 
    by deducting the Tax-Related Items from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and/or the Employer;  
     
   5 

(iv) 
    for U.S. Grantees, by allowing the Grantee to surrender other Shares that (A) in the case of Shares initially acquired from the Company (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), have been owned by the Grantee for such period (if any) as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company s earnings, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the Tax-Related Items; 
              (v) 
    by withholding a number of Shares to be issued upon delivery of Shares that have a Fair Market Value equal to the Tax-Related Items;  
              (vi)

              (vii) 
    by such other means or method as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Grantee deems appropriate; 
     provided, however, that if the Grantee is a Section 16 officer of the Company, within the meaning of the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods above. 
  Depending on the withholding method, the Company shall withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering (x) applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other withholding rates if withholding is in Shares or (y) if withholding is not in Shares but by another means, other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Grantee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 
  The Company will not issue any Shares unless and until the Grantee satisfies its obligations for Tax-Related Items.

APPENDIX B 
  Time Inc. 
  2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan 
  Performance Stock Units Agreement 
    
  Country-Specific Terms and Conditions 
    
  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Plan, the Performance Stock Units Agreement and the Terms and Conditions for Non-U.S. Grantees. 
  Terms and Conditions 
  This Appendix B includes additional terms and conditions that govern the PSUs if the Grantee resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below.  If the Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country (or is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one in which the Grantee is currently residing and/or working or if the Grantee moves to another country after receiving the grant of the PSUs, the Company will, in its discretion, determine the extent to which the terms and conditions herein will be applicable to the Grantee. 
  Notifications 
  This Appendix B also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which the Grantee should be aware with respect to the Grantee s participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of February 2016.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Grantee not rely on the information in this Appendix B as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Grantee s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the PSUs vest or the Grantee sells Shares acquired under the Plan. 
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Grantee s particular situation and the Company is not in a position to assure the Grantee of a particular result.  Accordingly, the Grantee is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Grantee s country may apply to the Grantee s situation. 
  If the Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Grantee is currently residing and/or working (or if the Grantee is considered as such for local law purposes) or if the Grantee moves to another country after receiving the grant of the PSUs, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Grantee in the same manner. 

UNITED KINGDOM 
  Terms and Conditions 
  Responsibility for Taxes.    The following provisions supplement Section 6 of the Agreement: 
  If payment or withholding of the income tax due in connection with the Award is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the tax year in which any event giving rise to the income tax liability occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K.  Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the      Due Date     ), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by the Grantee to the Employer, effective on the Due Date.  The Grantee agrees that the loan will bear interest at the official rate of Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs (     HMRC     ) and will be immediately due and repayable by the Grantee, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 6 of the Agreement or otherwise permitted under the Plan.  The Grantee authorizes the Company to delay the issuance of any Shares unless and until the loan is repaid in full. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee is an executive officer or director (as within the meaning of section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the Grantee shall not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax due as described above.  In the event that the Grantee is an executive officer or director and Tax-Related Items are not collected from or paid by the Grantee by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to the Grantee on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable.  the Grantee acknowledges that the Grantee ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Employer (as applicable) for the value of any national insurance contribution due on this additional benefit.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company or the Employer may recover such amounts from the Grantee by any of the means referred to in Section 6 of the Agreement, or otherwise permitted under the Plan. 
  Joint Election.    As a condition of the Grantee s participation in the Plan, the Grantee agrees to accept any liability for secondary Class 1 national insurance contributions which may be payable by the Company and/or the Employer in connection with the PSUs and any event giving rise to Tax-Related Items (the      Employer s NICs     ).  Without limitation to the foregoing, the Grantee agrees to enter into a joint election with the Company (the      Joint Election     ), the form of such Joint Election being formally approved by HMRC, and to execute any other consents or elections required to accomplish the transfer of the Employer s NICs to the Grantee.  The Grantee further agrees to execute such other joint elections as may be required between the Grantee and any successor to the Company and/or the Employer.  The Grantee further agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may collect the Employer s NICs from him or her by any of the means set forth in Section 6 of the Agreement. 
  If the Grantee does not complete the Joint Election prior to vesting of the PSUs, or if approval of the Joint Election is withdrawn by HMRC and a new Joint Election is not entered into, the PSUs shall become null and void and will not vest, without any liability to the Company or the Employer.

   4 

or regulation of any governmental body or national securities exchange that the Committee shall in its sole reasonable discretion determine to be necessary or advisable. 
  (iii)        Upon the Company s determination that the Option has been validly exercised as to any of the Shares, the Company shall issue certificates in the Grantee s name for such Shares or register the Grantee s ownership of such shares electronically.

  (iv)        In the event of the Grantee s death, the Vested Portion of an Option shall remain vested and exercisable by the Grantee s executor or administrator, or the person or persons to whom the Grantee s rights under this Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth in Section 4(a) of this Agreement.  Any heir or legatee of the Grantee shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 
  5.        No Right to Continued Employment or Future Grants of Options  .  The Grantee understands that nothing contained herein constitutes an employment contract and neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Grantee the right to be retained in the Employment of the Company or any Affiliate.  Further, the Company or its Affiliate may at any time dismiss the Grantee or discontinue any other relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.  The Grantee also agrees and acknowledges that grants of Options under the Plan are discretionary and any grant of Options under the Plan does not imply or create any obligation on the part of the Company to make any future grants of Options to the Grantee. 
  6.        Legend on Certificates  .  The certificates representing the Shares purchased by exercise of an Option shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem reasonably advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares are listed, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws and the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum applicable rates or other withholding rates including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Grantee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. 
  (ii)        The Grantee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if the Grantee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  9.        Securities Laws  .

   6 

other address as either party hereto may hereafter designate in writing to the other.  Any such notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee. 
  11.        Data Privacy  .  The Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Grantee s personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Option grant materials (   Data   ) by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and its Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Grantee s participation in the Plan. 
  The Grantee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Grantee, including, but not limited to, the Grantee s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Grantee s favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.   
  The Grantee understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC, or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  The Grantee understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients  country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Grantee s country.  The Grantee understands that he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative.  The Grantee authorizes the Company, Fidelity Stock Plan Services, LLC and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan.  The Grantee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Grantee s participation in the Plan.  If the Grantee resides outside the U.S., the Grantee understands that he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing his or her local human resources representative.  Further, the Grantee understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If the Grantee does not consent, or if the Grantee later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Grantee s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Grantee Options or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, the Grantee understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect the Grantee s ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of the Grantee s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Grantee understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.   12.        No Advice Regarding Grant  .  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor  
  
   7 

is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Grantee s participation in the Plan, or the Grantee s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares.

As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Grantee not rely on the information in this Appendix B as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Grantee s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the Option is exercised or the Grantee sells Shares acquired under the Plan.

Accordingly, the Grantee is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Grantee s country may apply to the Grantee s situation. 
  If the Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Grantee is currently residing and/or working (or if the Grantee is considered as such for local law purposes) or if the Grantee moves to another country after receiving the grant of the Option, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Grantee in the same manner.

The Grantee further agrees to execute such other joint elections as may be required between the Grantee and any successor to the Company and/or the Employer.  The Grantee further agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may collect the Employer s NICs from him or her by any of the means set forth in Section 8 of the Agreement. 
    
  If the Grantee does not complete the Joint Election prior to exercise of the Option, or if approval of the Joint Election is withdrawn by HMRC and a new Joint Election is not entered into, the Option shall become null and void and may not be exercised, without any liability to the Company or the Employer.

If your employment terminates pursuant to Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 below, you will have no repayment obligation. 
  4.      Benefits  .    You will be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of the Company, whether now existing or established hereafter, to the extent that you are eligible under the general provisions thereof as in effect from time to time.   
  5.      Termination  . 
  5.1      Termination for Cause  .   
  (a)    The Company may terminate your employment during the Term of Employment and all of the Company s obligations hereunder, other than its obligations set forth below in this Section 5.1, at any time for  Cause.    Cause  shall mean termination because of your (a) conviction (treating a nolo contendere plea as a conviction) of a felony (whether or not any right to appeal has been or may be exercised), (b) willful failure or refusal without proper cause to perform your duties with the Company, including your obligations under this Agreement (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental impairment) and, after having been given written notice thereof by the Company, failure to correct such willful failure or refusal to perform (if curable) within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, (c) misappropriation,  
  
   2 

embezzlement or reckless or willful destruction of Company property, (d) breach of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company, (e) intentional and improper conduct materially prejudicial to the business of the Company or any of its affiliates, or (f) breach of any of the covenants provided for in Section 6 hereof. 
  (b)    In the event of the termination of your employment by the Company for Cause, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law or in equity, the Company shall have no further obligations to you other than to: (i) pay Base Salary and unused vacation accrued in accordance with Company policy through the effective date of termination, (ii) pay approved, unreimbursed business expenses in accordance with Company policy; and (iii) comply with obligations owed under the Company s benefit plans in accordance with their terms as in effect as of the effective date of termination ((i) through (iii) collectively, the  Termination Entitlement ). 
  5.2      Termination Due to Death  .  This Agreement shall terminate upon your death and the Company shall not have any further obligations hereunder, except that your estate will be entitled to receive, in addition to any regular life insurance benefits paid by the Company, the Termination Entitlement. 
  5.3      Termination Due to Disability  .  If during the Term of Employment you become physically or mentally disabled, whether totally or partially, so that you are prevented from performing the material functions of your position for periods aggregating six (6) months in any twelve (12) month period, the Company will be entitled to terminate the Term of Employment upon written notice to you given at any time thereafter during which you are still disabled.  You will thereafter be entitled to receive, in addition to the Termination Entitlement, (subject to the requirements of Section 5.7) for the greater of the remainder of the original Term of Employment or twelve (12) months, bi-weekly payments made in substantially equal installments in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company, and subject to payroll deductions and required withholdings, at an annualized rate equal to the sum of your Base Salary and  Average Annual Bonus  (as defined below), but reduced on a monthly basis by an amount equal to the disability payments received for such month by you from Workers  Compensation, Social Security and disability insurance policies maintained by the Company or its affiliate; provided, however, that all payments under this Section 5.3 shall cease upon the earlier of: (i) your commencing substantially full-time employment, or (ii) you ceasing to be eligible for long-term disability benefits under the Company s or an affiliate s long-term disability plan or becoming eligible only for partial benefits of less than fifty percent (50%) under such plan.  Upon the termination of payments made pursuant to this Section 5.3, your disability payments, if any, will be determined in accordance with the Company s long-term disability program then in effect, and no further payments will be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  All payments made under this Section 5.3 after the date of termination of employment are intended to be disability payments, regardless of the manner in which they are computed.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Average Annual Bonus  shall be defined as an amount equal to the average of the two (2) highest Bonus amounts received by you before the effective date of your termination (excluding any special, spot or long term incentive plan bonuses) for the most recent five (5) completed Bonus plan years at the Company.  If you have received only one full-year Bonus payment, then Average Annual Bonus shall equal the amount of such Bonus.  If you have not received any Bonus payments, or if you received only one Bonus  
  
   3 

payment and such Bonus was prorated because you did not work the full Bonus plan year, then in lieu of an Average Annual Bonus you will receive $500,000.    5.4      Other Termination by the Company  .    
  (a)    The Company may terminate your employment during the Term of Employment, other than a termination under Sections 5.1, 5.2, or 5.3, at any time upon written notice to you.  In the event that your employment is so terminated, in addition to the Termination Entitlement, you will receive (subject to the requirements of Section 5.7), for the duration of the Severance Period (defined in Section 5.4(b) below), bi-weekly payments made in substantially equal installments in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company, and subject to payroll deductions and required withholdings, at an annualized rate equal to the sum of your Base Salary and Average Annual Bonus; provided however, that: 
  (i)    if you die during the Severance Period, your payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall cease, and your estate will be entitled to receive, in addition to any regular life insurance benefits paid by the Company, any payments due pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) through the date of your death;  
    
  (ii)    if you accept benefits-eligible employment with any other corporation, partnership, trust, government or other entity during the Severance Period (notice of such employment to be provided to the Company within ten (10) business days) or otherwise notify the Company in writing of your intention to terminate your benefits during the Severance Period, you will continue to receive all payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a), but shall cease to receive any applicable post-termination benefits described in Section 5.4(c) below, effective upon the commencement of such employment or the effective date of such termination as specified by you in your notice of intention to terminate benefits; and 
  (iii)    if you accept employment with the Company or a related or affiliated entity during the Severance Period, your payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall cease effective the first date of employment with such related or affiliated entity. 
  (b)    The  Severance Period  shall be 12 months. 
  (c)    During the Severance Period, unless prohibited by law, you will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company s health and life insurance plans on the same terms and conditions as regular full-time employees.  During the Severance Period, you will not be entitled to any additional awards or grants under any equity plan or other Long-Term Incentive Plan or to continue elective deferrals in or accrue additional benefits under the Company s 401(k) plan or any other qualified or nonqualified retirement programs maintained by the Company. 
  (d)    If the Company terminates your employment during the Term of Employment pursuant to this Section 5.4, provided that you have participated in the AIP plan for at least six months of the fiscal year, you will receive an additional severance payment in lieu of an AIP Bonus payment in the amount of what you would have earned under the AIP plan if your employment had not terminated, calculated using a prorated target based on the number of days you were employed during the plan year, a strategic rating of 100% and actual Company/Division  
  
   4 

financial performance.  This severance payment will be paid at the same time AIP bonus payments for the applicable plan year are made to active employees. 
  (e)    In the event that the Company terminates the Term of Employment pursuant to this Section 5.4, you shall not be required to take actions in order to mitigate your damages hereunder, unless Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), would apply to any payments to you by the Company and your failure to mitigate would result in the Company losing tax deductions to which it would otherwise have been entitled.  In such an event, you will engage in whatever mitigation is necessary to preserve the Company s tax deductions.  With respect to the preceding sentences, any payments or rights to which you are entitled by reason of the termination of employment without cause shall be considered as damages hereunder. Any obligation to mitigate your damages pursuant to this Section 5.4(f) shall not be a defense or offset to the Company s obligation to pay you in full the amounts provided in this Section 5.4 upon the occurrence of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4 at the times provided herein, or the timely and full performance of any of the Company s other obligations under this Section 5.4. 
  (f)    If the Company does not offer to renew this Agreement upon expiration of the Term of Employment, and your employment is subsequently terminated by the Company for a reason other than Cause, such termination will be treated as a termination pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, and you will be subject to the requirements of Sections 5.7 and 6.   
  5.5      Termination Due to Material Breach by Company  .  You will have the right, exercisable by notice to the Company, to terminate your employment, effective thirty (30) days after the giving of notice, if at the time of such notice, the Company shall be in material breach of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that such notice is provided to the Company within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such material breach; and provided further, this Agreement and your employment will not so terminate if within such thirty (30)-day notice period the Company has cured all such material breaches of its obligations hereunder.  If such material breach has not been so cured, you may elect, subject to the requirements of Section 5.7, to treat such breach as a termination of the Term of Employment by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4 above, and you shall be entitled to the rights and benefits provided for therein. 
  5.6      Resignation or Retirement  .  You may terminate the Term of Employment for any reason, including, without limitation, your retirement, at any time on sixty (60) days  prior written notice to the Company.  In such event, the Company s only obligation to you will be payment of the Termination Entitlement.  In any instance in which you provide written notice of your termination of the Term of Employment to the Company, the Company may elect to terminate your employment immediately, in which case the Company s only obligation to you will be payment of the Termination Entitlement, treating the last day of the notice period as the date of termination solely for purposes of calculating the Termination Entitlement.  In no event will the Company s early termination of your employment pursuant to the preceding sentence be considered a termination of the Term of Employment by the Company under Section 5.4 and in no event shall the Company s early termination of you pursuant to the preceding sentence require the Company to provide the Termination Entitlement for any greater period than the period beginning on the date your written notice of termination is received by the Company and ending sixty (60) days thereafter.  
  
   5 

5.7      Release  .  In the event of a termination of the Term of Employment pursuant to Sections 5.3, 5.4, or 5.5 above,  a condition precedent to the Company s obligation to make or continue to make the payments associated with such termination shall be your execution and delivery to the Company of a release of all claims you may have against the Company, its affiliates and their related persons arising out of or in connection with your employment or termination of employment, including, but not limited to, a release of all claims of discrimination, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit  A (as such form may be updated in the discretion of the Company).  The Company will deliver such release to you at or about the time it delivers or receives the notice of termination, and you will execute and deliver such release to the Executive Vice President, Human Resources or his or her designee within twenty-one (21) days thereafter (or forty-five (45) days if required by law).  The Company will begin to make any severance payments due to you pursuant to Sections 5.3, 5.4, or 5.5 above on the next administratively feasible payroll date following the termination of your employment; however, if you fail to execute and deliver such release to the Company within the 21-day period (or forty-five (45) day period if required by law), or if you revoke your consent to such release as provided therein, you will not be eligible to receive any further payments from the Company, and you will be obligated to return to the Company all severance payments received pursuant to Sections 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5 within ten (10) business days after receipt of notice pursuant to Section 9.1. 
  5.8      No Other Payments or Benefits  .  In the event your employment is terminated during the Term of Employment, you shall not be entitled to any severance under the Company s general employee policies or any severance policy or plan maintained by the Company, the payment and benefits provided for in this Agreement constituting the sole source of any payments or benefits payable to you except any amounts payable to you as required by applicable law.  Except as may be otherwise provided in Section 5.4(c), your rights to benefits and payments under any benefit plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan, or other plan of the Company will be determined in accordance with the then current terms and provisions of such plans and any agreements under which such benefits or payments were granted.   
  5.9      Forfeiture  .  In the event you breach the terms of Section 6 of this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that you shall forfeit any remaining amounts due to you under this Section 5 other than your Termination Entitlement.   The Company s rights contained in this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to, and shall not limit, any other rights or remedies that the Company may have under law or in equity. 
  6.      Protection of Confidential Information, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Non-Disparagement and Cooperation  .  
  6.1      Protection of Confidential Information and Non-Competition Covenants  .   
  (a)       Acknowledgements  .  You acknowledge that your employment by the Company will bring you into close contact with many confidential affairs of the Company, including information about costs, profits, markets, sales, products, key personnel, operational methods, technical processes, plans for future development and other business affairs and editorial matters not readily available to the public.

  (b)      Safeguarding of Confidential Information  .  You will keep secret all confidential matters of the Company, including without limitation, the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any payments or benefits you receive pursuant to this Agreement in connection with a termination of employment, and will not use for your own benefit or intentionally disclose such matters to anyone outside of the Company, either during or after the Term of Employment, except with the Company s written consent, provided that (i) you will have no such obligation to the extent such matters are or become publicly known other than as a result of your breach of your obligations hereunder; (ii) you may, after giving prior notice to the Company to the extent practicable under the circumstances, disclose such matters to the extent required by applicable laws or governmental regulations or judicial or regulatory process; and (iii) you may disclose the terms of this Agreement to your spouse or life partner, attorney, accountant, and/or financial advisor, provided that such persons also agree to maintain such confidentiality.  Nothing in this provision prohibits you from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. You do not need the Company s prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures, and you are not required to notify the Company that you have made such reports or disclosures.  The rights set forth herein are in addition to all rights the Company may have under the common law or applicable statutory laws relating to the protection of trade secrets; 
       (c)      Return of Company Property and Information  .  Upon termination of your employment for any reason, or at any other time the Company may so request, you will deliver promptly to the Company all memoranda, notes, records, reports and other documents (and all copies thereof) in any form whatsoever (including information contained in computer memory or on any computer disks or other storage devices) relating to the Company s business, which you obtained while employed by, or otherwise serving or acting on behalf of, the Company and which you may then possess or have under your control and not maintain copies of any such documents on any personal computer or other storage device in your personal possession.  No later than the effective date of your termination, you will also return all Company property previously in your possession, including but not limited to any Company equipment, electronic devices, keys, identification cards, and credit cards;     
  (d)      Nonsolicitation of Employees  .  (i) During the Term of Employment, and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the effective date of your termination of employment pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.3 or 5.6, and (iii) during the Severance Period for any termination of your employment pursuant to Sections 5.4 or 5.5, you will not, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit the employment of, and shall not assist, induce, cause or encourage any other person or entity to employ or solicit the employment of, any person who was an employee of the Company or any of its affiliated companies at the date of your termination or within six (6) months prior thereto;  
  
   7 

provided, however, that this Section 6.1(d) shall not preclude     general advertising for personnel or responding to an unsolicited request for a personal recommendation for or evaluation of an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; and    
  (e)      Noncompetition  .  (i) During the Term of Employment, and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the effective date of your termination of employment pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.3 or 5.6, and (iii) during the Severance Period for any termination of your employment pursuant to Sections 5.4 or 5.5; you will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, or his or her designee, render any services to any other person or entity, or own or acquire any interest of any type in any other person or entity which is engaged, either directly or indirectly, in any line of business that is substantially the same as any material line of business which the Company engages in, conducts or, to your knowledge has definitive plans to engage in or conduct.  The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit you from acquiring securities of any corporation which are publicly traded so long as such securities do not constitute more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting power of that public company.  For clarity s sake, Sections 6.1(d) and 6.1(e) will not apply in the event that this Agreement expires at the end of the Term of Employment, is not renewed, and your employment terminates for any reason other than pursuant to Section 5.4(f), in which case Sections 6.1(d) and 6.1(e) will continue to apply. 
  (f)      Waiver  .   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your employment with the Company is terminated pursuant to Sections 5.4 or 5.5 and you are eligible to receive payments pursuant to Section 5.4(a) for a period of more than 12 months, commencing with the 13th month of the Severance Period, you may elect, upon thirty (30) days  advance written notice to the Company, to be relieved of your obligations under Sections 6.1(d) and (e) hereof.  Upon any such election by you, the Company shall waive your obligations under Sections 6.1(d) and (e) for the remainder of the Severance Period, but you shall in return forfeit your right to receive any remaining amounts due to you pursuant to Section 5.4(a).  Any such election shall be irrevocable by you as of the date on which the first forfeited payment would otherwise be made. 
  6.2      No Use of Client Information; Nonsolicitation of Company Clients or Prospective Clients.      You acknowledge that the Company has a compelling business interest in preventing unfair competition stemming from the use or disclosure of confidential client information, including but not limited to the identity of clients and prospective clients ( Client Information ), in the event that, after any termination of your employment with the Company, you go to work for or become affiliated with a competitor of the Company or otherwise engage in business activities that are competitive with those of the Company.  You further acknowledge that all clients serviced by you as an executive of the Company are clients of the Company and not yours personally, and that by virtue of your employment with the Company, you have gained or will gain knowledge of the identity, characteristics, and preferences of clients, and that you would inevitably have to draw on Client Information if you were to solicit or service the Company s clients or contact prospective clients on behalf of a competing business enterprise. Accordingly, you agree that for one (1) year following the termination of your employment for any reason, you will not, in connection with a business in competition with the Company, solicit the business of or service any actual or prospective client for whom you provided any services or as to whom you had access to Client Information during the course of your employment with the Company.  You also agree that, during this one-year period, you will not encourage or assist any person or entity in competition with the  
  
   8 

Company to solicit or service any actual or prospective client of the Company covered by this Section 6.2, or otherwise seek to encourage or induce any such client to cease doing business with, or lessen its business with, the Company. 
  6.3      Non-Disparagement  .  You will not make any statements that are professionally or personally disparaging about, or adverse to, the interests of the Company (including any subsidiaries or affiliates and each of their officers, directors, and employees), including, but not limited to, any statements that disparage any person, product, service, financial condition, or any other aspect of the business of the Company, Company subsidiaries or affiliates, provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent you from exercising your rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.  The Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice Presidents of the Company will not make any disparaging statements about you to anyone not employed by the Company or its affiliates.  Nothing herein shall prevent you or the Company from testifying truthfully under oath pursuant to any lawful court order or subpoena or otherwise responding to or providing disclosures required by law. 
  6.4      Cooperation  .  Following the termination of your employment under this Agreement for any reason, you agree to cooperate with the Company in providing for an orderly transition through the effective date of your termination of employment pursuant to Section 5 and thereafter, which cooperation shall include giving such assistance at reasonable times as may be reasonably requested by the Company.  Such cooperation shall extend to additional matters as reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, including, without limitation, legal matters about which you have knowledge by virtue of your employment with the Company.  The Company will reimburse you for your reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (excluding attorneys  fees) incurred by you in connection with providing such assistance to the extent allowed by applicable law. 
  7.      Ownership of Work Product  .   You acknowledge that during the Term of Employment, you may  ,   in the course of your employment  ,   conceive of, discover, invent or create inventions, improvements, new contributions, literary property, material, ideas and discoveries, whether patentable or copyrightable or not (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to herein as  Work Product ), and that various business opportunities shall be presented to you by reason of your employment by the Company.  You acknowledge that, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing, all of the foregoing shall be owned by and belong exclusively to the Company and that you will have no personal interest therein, provided that they are,     in the case of Work Product, conceived or made on the Company s time or with the use of the Company s facilities or materials, or, in the case of business opportunities, are presented to you for the possible interest or participation of the Company. You will further, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing, (i) promptly disclose any such Work Product and business opportunities to the Company; (ii) assign to the Company, upon request and without additional compensation, the entire rights to such Work Product and business opportunities to the extent not otherwise owned at law by the Company; (iii) sign all papers necessary to carry out the foregoing; and (iv) give testimony in support of your inventorship or creation in any appropriate case. You agree that you will not assert any rights to any Work Product or business opportunity as having been made or acquired by you prior to the date of this Agreement except for Work Product or business opportunities, if any, disclosed to and acknowledged by the Company in writing prior to the date hereof.  In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, any copyrightable work created in connection with the services provided by you hereunder shall  
  
   9 

be considered  work made for hire  under the Copyright Law of 1976 and any successor thereto, and the Company shall be the owner of such work. 
  8.      Representations  .   
  (a)    You represent and warrant that you are not a party to any agreements or understandings which would prevent your fulfillment of the terms of this Agreement or which would be violated by entering into this Agreement and performing your obligations hereunder.   
  (b)    The Company shall have the right to use your name, biography and likeness in connection with its respective businesses and that of its subsidiaries and affiliates, but not as a direct endorsement. 
  (c)    You shall be entitled throughout the Term of Employment (and after the end of the Term of Employment, to the extent relating to service during the Term of Employment) to the benefit of the indemnification provisions contained on the date hereof in the Charter and By-laws of the Company (not including any amendments or additions after the Effective Date that limit or narrow, but including any that add to or broaden, the protection afforded to you by those provisions).

  9.4      Entire Agreement and No Other Representations  .  The parties expressly acknowledge, represent and agree that this Agreement (together with all exhibits and the Company s Standards of Business Conduct) is fully integrated, and contains and constitutes the complete and  
  
   10 

entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes any and all agreements, understandings, and discussions, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof.  The parties further acknowledge, represent and agree that neither has made any representations, promises or statements to induce the other party to enter into this Agreement, and each party specifically disclaims reliance, and represents that there has been no reliance, on any such representations, promises or statements and any rights arising therefrom.   
  9.5      Assignability  .  This Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned by you.  The Company may assign its rights, together with its obligations, hereunder in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Company or of the magazine, group, or division, which is employing you and such rights and obligations shall inure to, and be binding upon, any successor to the business or substantially all of the assets of the Company or of the magazine, group, or division which is employing you; whether by merger, purchase of stock or assets or otherwise, and such successor shall expressly assume such obligations. 
  9.6      Amendments, Waivers  .  This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded, canceled, renewed or extended and the terms or covenants hereof may be waived only by written instrument executed by both of the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance.  The failure of either party at any time or times to require performance of any provisions hereof shall in no manner affect such party s right at a later time to enforce the same.  No waiver by either party of the breach of any term or covenant contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any such breach, or a waiver of the breach of any other term or covenant contained in this Agreement. 
  9.7      Arbitration  .  The parties agree that all claims, disputes, and/or controversies arising under this Agreement and/or related to your employment hereunder (whether or not based on contract, tort or upon any federal, state or local statute, including but not limited to claims asserted under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, any state fair employment practices act, and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act), shall be resolved exclusively through mediation/arbitration by JAMS, in the County of New York in the State of New York, in accordance with the JAMS Rules and Procedures for Mediation/Arbitration of Employment Disputes; provided, however, that in the event that the Company alleges that you are in breach of any of the provisions contained in Section 6 or 7 of this Agreement, the Company shall not be exclusively required to submit such dispute to mediation/arbitration.  In such event, the Company may, at its option, seek and obtain from any court having jurisdiction, injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to pursuing at arbitration all other remedies available to it (including without limitation any claims for relief arising out of any breach of Section 6 or 7 of this Agreement).  In the event that the Company chooses to bring any such suit, proceeding or action for injunctive or equitable relief in an appropriate court, you hereby waive your right, if any, to trial by jury, and hereby waive your right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever and agree to arbitrate any and all such claims. 
  
   11 

9.8      Specific Remedy  .  In addition to such other rights and remedies as the Company may have at equity or in law with respect to any breach of this Agreement, if you commit a material breach of any of the provisions of Sections 6 or 7, the Company will have the right and remedy to have such provisions specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company.  In the event that you violate any of the provisions of Sections 6 or 7, the period of the restrictive covenants set forth in those provisions shall be extended for the period of time you remain in violation.  You also agree to indemnify the Company and hold the Company harmless from any and all losses suffered by the Company as a result of any violation by you of this Agreement, and to pay the Company s reasonable attorneys  fees and other legal expenses incurred to enforce this Agreement. 
  9.9      Acknowledgment and Consent.

If a court should determine that any provision of this Agreement is overbroad or unreasonable, such provision shall be given effect to the maximum extent possible by narrowing or enforcing in part that aspect of the provision found overbroad or unreasonable.

  9.13      Compliance with IRC Section 409A  .

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of your termination of employment with the Company you are a  specified employee  as  
  
   12 

defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to you) until the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code).  On the first day of the seventh month following the date of your separation from service, or if earlier, the date of your death, (x) all payments delayed pursuant to this paragraph (whether they would have otherwise been paid or reimbursed to you in a single sum or in installments) shall be paid or reimbursed to you in a single sum and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal dates specified for them in this Agreement. In addition, if any other payments of money or other benefits due to you hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Company, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax.  To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to you under this Agreement constitute  deferred compensation  under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to you in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv).  Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated as a  separate payment  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  References herein to a termination of your employment shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which you have experienced a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A.  The Company shall consult with you in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 9.12; provided that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to you with respect thereto. 
  9.14      No Offset  .  Neither you nor the Company shall have any right to offset any amounts owed by one party hereunder against amounts owed or claimed to be owed to such party, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and you and the Company shall make all the payments provided for in this Agreement in a timely manner. 
  9.15      Survival  .  Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 shall survive any termination of the Term of Employment pursuant to Section 5 and any expiration of this Agreement and shall apply for the duration of employment and beyond in accordance with their terms. 
  9.16      Counterparts  . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of which shall constitute one original instrument. 
  9.17      Interpretation  .  The parties to this Agreement have cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement.  Hence, in any construction or interpretation of this Agreement, the same shall not be construed against any party on the basis that such party was the drafter.

If the last day on which the Option may be exercised, whether the Expiration Date or an earlier date due to a termination of the Grantee s Employment prior to the Expiration Date, is a Saturday, Sunday or other day that is not a trading day on the NYSE or, if the Company s Shares are not then listed on the NYSE, such other stock exchange or trading system that is the primary exchange on which the Company s Shares are then traded, then the last day on which the Option may be exercised shall be the preceding trading day on the NYSE or such other stock exchange or trading system.   
  (b)        Method of Exercise  .

Payment of the aggregate Option Price shall be paid to the Company, at the election of the Committee, pursuant to one or more of the following methods: (A) in cash, or its equivalent; (B) for U.S. Grantees, by transferring Shares already owned by the Grantee (for the period necessary to avoid a charge to the Company s earnings for financial reporting purposes) having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased to the Company and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee; (C) for U.S. Grantees, partly in cash and partly in Shares; or (D) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee, through delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Option Price and any Tax-Related Items withholding.  No Grantee shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares subject to the Option until the issuance of the Shares. 
  (ii)        Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, absent an available exemption to registration or qualification, the Option may not be exercised prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Option or the Shares under applicable U.S. state, federal or foreign securities or other laws, or under any ruling or regulation of any governmental body or national securities exchange that the Committee shall in its sole reasonable discretion determine to be necessary or advisable. 
  (iii)        Upon the Company s determination that the Option has been validly exercised as to any of the Shares, the Company shall issue certificates in the Grantee s name for such Shares or register the Grantee s ownership of such shares electronically.  However, the Company shall not be liable to the Grantee for damages relating to any delays in issuing the Shares to the Grantee, any loss by the Grantee of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the issuance of the certificates or in the certificates themselves.

(iv)        In the event of the Grantee s death, the Vested Portion of an Option shall remain vested and exercisable by the Grantee s executor or administrator, or the person or persons to whom the Grantee s rights under this Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth in Section 4(a) of this Agreement.  Any heir or legatee of the Grantee shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 
  5.        No Right to Continued Employment or Future Grants of Options  .  The Grantee understands that nothing contained herein constitutes an employment contract and neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Grantee the right to be retained in the Employment of the Company or any Affiliate.  Further, the Company or its Affiliate may at any time dismiss the Grantee or discontinue any other relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.  The Grantee also agrees and acknowledges that grants of Options under the Plan are discretionary and any grant of Options under the Plan does not imply or create any obligation on the part of the Company to make any future grants of Options to the Grantee. 
  6.        Legend on Certificates  .  The certificates representing the Shares purchased by exercise of an Option shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem reasonably advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares are listed, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws and the Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 
  7.        Transferability  .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an Option may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. 
  8.        Responsibility for Taxes  .   
  (a)        Obligation to Pay Withholding Taxes  .  The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action taken or failed to be taken by the Company or, if different, the Grantee s employer (the    Employer   ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and payment on account or other tax-related items related to Grantee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Grantee (the    Tax-Related Items   ), is and remains the Grantee s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Grantee further agrees and acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant of the Option, the vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Option or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee is subject to tax in more than one  
  
   5 

jurisdiction, as applicable, the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.   
  (b)        Satisfaction of Company s Withholding Obligations  . 
  (i)        No later than any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items due as a result of such taxable or tax withholding event.  In this regard, Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding from any payment due or transfer made under the Option or under the Plan or from any proceeds of the sale of Shares in a cashless exercise or any compensation or other amount owing to a Grantee, by the Company or the Employer, the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Options or other property) of any applicable Tax-Related Items in respect of the Option, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under the Option or under the Plan.  Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum applicable rates or other withholding rates including maximum applicable rates, in which case the Grantee will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. 
  (ii)        The Grantee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if the Grantee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  9.        Securities Laws  .

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Grantee agrees to enter into a joint election with the Company (the    Joint Election   ), the form of such Joint Election being formally approved by HMRC, and to execute any other consents or elections required to accomplish the transfer of the Employer s NICs to the Grantee.  The Grantee further agrees to execute such other joint elections as may be required between the Grantee and any successor to the Company and/or the Employer.  The Grantee further agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may collect the Employer s NICs from him or her by any of the means set forth in Section 8 of the Agreement. 
    
  If the Grantee does not complete the Joint Election prior to exercise of the Option, or if approval of the Joint Election is withdrawn by HMRC and a new Joint Election is not entered into, the Option shall become null and void and may not be exercised, without any liability to the Company or the Employer.

  New York, New York 10281 
    
  Dear Evelyn: 
    
  Reference is made to your Employment Agreement dated February 19, 2014 (the  Employment Agreement ) with Time Inc. (the  Company ).  Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined in this agreement ( Separation Agreement ) shall have the meanings given such terms in the Employment Agreement.  We have agreed that your employment with the Company will be terminated and the provisions of Section 5.4 of your Employment Agreement will apply, subject to the modifications set forth in this Separation Agreement (which modifications shall be deemed to constitute an amendment to your Employment Agreement).  This Separation Agreement sets forth the understandings between the Company and you concerning the termination of your employment and your entitlements under the Employment Agreement. 
    
  You and the Company, intending to reflect our mutual understanding regarding the terms of the plan for the separation of your employment from the Company, hereby agree as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Your duties and responsibilities as Executive Vice President shall cease effective August 31, 2016 ( Separation Date ) at which time you shall be deemed to have resigned from all boards, committees and positions related to, or affiliated with, the Company.   
       
           2. 
    Pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Employment Agreement, and subject to your execution of the General Release attached hereto as Exhibit  A  and incorporated by reference herein, you shall receive a severance benefit equivalent to 18 months of Base Salary (at the annual rate of $850,000) and Average AIP (at the annual rate of $707,903), for a total cash severance payment of $2,336,855,     less applicable withholdings and deductions.  Effective the first day after the Separation Date, you will receive such severance by remaining on Company payroll and receiving such severance in substantially equal bi-weekly payments for 18 months (the  Severance Period ).   
       
           3. 
    During the Severance Period, unless prohibited by law, you will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company s health and life insurance plans on the same terms and conditions as regular full-time employees.  During the Severance Period, you will not be entitled to any additional awards or grants under any equity plan or other Long-Term Incentive Plan or to continue elective deferrals in or accrue additional benefits under the Company s 401(k) plan or any other qualified or nonqualified retirement programs maintained by the Company.  Your unvested equity will cancel on the Separation Date in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement(s). 
       
           4. 
    If you accept employment with the Company or a related or affiliated company during the Severance Period, all payments under this Separation Agreement shall cease immediately upon the acceptance of such employment, and any remaining payments shall be forfeited. 
     
   1 

5. 
    If you accept benefits-eligible employment with any other corporation, partnership, trust, government or other entity during the Severance Period (notice of such employment to be provided to the Company within ten (10) business days) or otherwise notify the Company in writing of your intention to terminate your benefits during the Severance Period, you shall cease to receive any applicable post-termination benefits described in Paragraph 3 above, effective upon the commencement of such employment or the effective date of such termination as specified by you in your notice of intention to terminate benefits.  Unless the employment violates Section 6 of the Employment Agreement or the provisions of Section 6.1(f) of the Employment Agreement apply, you will continue to receive all payments pursuant to this Separation Agreement. 
       
           6. 
    If you die during the Severance Period, your payments pursuant to this Separation Agreement shall cease, and your estate will be entitled to receive, in addition to any regular life insurance benefits paid by the Company, any payments due pursuant to this Separation Agreement through the date of your death. 
       
           7. 
    The Company will provide you with one year of outplacement services.  Such outplacement services must commence within 90 days of the Separation Date.   
       
           8. 
    On or before March 15, 2017, at the same time as all other eligible employees, you will receive an additional severance payment in lieu of an AIP Bonus payment for 2016 in the amount of what you would have earned under the AIP plan if your employment had not terminated, calculated using a prorated target based on the number of days you were employed in 2016, a strategic rating of 100% and actual Company/Division financial performance. 
       
           9. 
    You will receive payment for any unused vacation and personal days accrued through your Separation Date.  After that date, you will not accrue any additional vacation and you will not be eligible for any additional personal days.  
       
           10. 
    The Company agrees to pay for the preparation of your US and UK tax returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018 and will cover the costs of any tax-related expenses insofar as they relate to your employment with Time Inc. 
       
           11. 
    Without limiting the express provisions of this Separation Agreement, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (except for Sections 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) of the Employment Agreement, are superseded in their entirety by this Separation Agreement, and shall have no further force or effect.  The remaining portions of the Employment Agreement shall continue in accordance with their terms after giving effect to the amendments provided for in this Separation Agreement, and you shall continue to be subject to any obligations under the Employment Agreement that survive your termination of employment including, but not limited to, Sections 6 (confidential information, non-compete and non-solicitation), 7 (ownership of work product) and 8 (representations).   
       
           12. 
    You acknowledge and agree that except as provided in this Separation Agreement, no other termination payments or payments of any other kind are due you by the Company, other than any vested benefits to which you may be entitled under the Time Inc. Savings Plan, the Time Inc. Supplemental Savings Plan, and/or the Time Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, as applicable.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute a release of any claim for indemnification for acts or omissions taken or omitted to be taken  
     
   2 

by you or prior to August 31, 2016, under the Charter and Bylaws of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. 
    
           13. 
    You agree that the Company has provided you with Travel and Expense reimbursement of all expenses incurred in performance of your job functions through the date of this letter and that there are no outstanding reimbursements due.  
       
           14. 
    You must keep this Agreement and its terms confidential and may only discuss the contents and substance of this Separation Agreement with your immediate family members, and your financial and legal advisors, provided such other persons agree to be bound by the terms of such confidentiality provisions, except where required by lawful subpoena or where required by law.   
       
           15. 
    You agree to cooperate with the Company in providing for an orderly transition through the Separation Date and thereafter, which cooperation shall include giving such assistance at reasonable times as may be reasonably requested by the Company. Such cooperation shall extend to additional matters as reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, including, without limitation, legal matters about which you have knowledge by virtue of your employment with the Company.  The Company will reimburse you for your reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (excluding attorneys  fees) incurred by you in connection with providing such assistance to the extent allowed by applicable law.   
       
           16. 
    You will not make any statements that are professionally or personally disparaging about, or adverse to, the interests of the Company (including any subsidiaries or affiliates and each of their officers, directors, and employees), including, but not limited to, any statements that disparage any person, product, service, financial condition, or any other aspect of the business of the Company, Company subsidiaries or affiliates, provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent you from exercising your rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.  The Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice Presidents of the Company will not make any disparaging statements about you to anyone not employed by the Company or its affiliates.  Nothing herein shall prevent you or the Company or its current or former employees from testifying truthfully under oath pursuant to any lawful court order or subpoena or otherwise responding to or providing disclosures required by law. 
       
           17. 
    You acknowledge that: (a) you have carefully read this Separation Agreement together with the General Release (which is fully incorporated herein) in its entirety; (b) you have had an opportunity to consider fully its terms for at least twenty-one (21) days; (c) you have been advised in writing by the Company to consult with an attorney of your choosing before signing this Separation Agreement; (d) you fully understand the significance of all the terms and conditions of this Separation Agreement; (e) you have discussed it with independent legal counsel, or have had a reasonable opportunity to do so; (f) you have had answered to your satisfaction any questions you have asked with regard to the meaning and significance of any of the provisions of this Separation Agreement; and (g) you are signing this Separation Agreement voluntarily and of your own free will and agree to all the terms and conditions contained herein.  You have the right to revoke your consent to this Separation Agreement and General Release for seven days following your signing of them.  Provided you do not revoke them, the effective date of this Separation Agreement and General Release shall be the 8   th    day after you sign them. 
       
           18. 
    The parties expressly acknowledge, represent and agree that the Employment Agreement, as modified by this Separation Agreement and the General Release executed and delivered pursuant to this Separation Agreement, are fully integrated and contain and constitute the complete and entire agreement and  
     
   3

           19. 
    To the extent that payments and benefits in this Separation Agreement are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), this Separation Agreement is intended to comply with and will be interpreted in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to you under this Separation Agreement constitute  deferred compensation  under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to you in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv).  Each separately identified payment made under this Separation Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(2).  The Company shall consult with you in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Paragraph 19, provided that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to you with respect thereto.   
       
  All of the above shall be contingent upon your execution of this Separation Agreement and the General Release attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit  A.   Should you fail to execute the General Release, or should you revoke such execution as provided for therein, this Separation Agreement shall be null and void. 
    
  If the foregoing accurately represents our agreement, kindly execute Exhibit  A,  countersign this Separation Agreement and return both to the undersigned. 
    
  Sincerely,

Exhibit  A  

GENERAL RELEASE 
    
    This General Release is made by me, Evelyn Webster, as of the date set forth below in connection with the Employment Agreement dated February 19, 2014 between me and Time Inc. (the  Company ), and the separation agreement between me and the Company dated July 24, 2016 (the  Separation Agreement ), and in association with the termination of my employment with the Company. 
    
  In consideration of payments made to me by the Company and other benefits to be received by me pursuant to the Employment Agreement, as further reflected in the Separation Agreement, I, Evelyn Webster, being of lawful age, and on behalf of myself, my heirs, dependents, executors, administrators, trustees, legal representatives and assigns (collectively referred to as  Releasors ) do hereby release and forever discharge the Company and Time Warner Inc., and each of their respective parent entities, subsidiaries, divisions, related and affiliated entities and employee benefit plans, and all of their officers, directors, shareholders, agents, administrators, trustees, fiduciaries and employees (in their official and individual capacities), and all of their heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to herein as  Time Inc. Entities and Persons ), of and from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, or demands of any kind whatsoever (including without limitation for general, special or punitive damages, attorney s fees, expenses, or other compensation and/or equitable remedy), known or unknown, which in any way relate to or arise out of my employment with the Time Inc. Entities and Persons or the termination of such employment, which I had or may now have against any Time Inc. Entities or Persons by reason of any actual or alleged act, omission, transaction, practice, conduct, statement, occurrence, or other matter up to and including the date I sign this General Release.  Each of the Time Inc. Entities and Persons is intended to be a third party beneficiary under this General Release. 
    
  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this General Release is intended to and shall release the Time Inc. Entities and Persons from any and all claims, whether known or unknown, which Releasors ever had or may now have against any of the Time Inc. Entities and Persons arising out of my employment, the terms and conditions of such employment, and/or the termination or separation of my employment, including but not limited to: (i) any claims of discrimination or harassment in employment on the basis of age, religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, national origin, disability or any other legally protected characteristic, and of retaliation, under, without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.   1981, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act, the New York Human Rights Law, the New York Labor Law; the New York City Administrative Code,     and all other federal, state and local equal employment opportunity and fair employment practice laws (all as amended); (ii) any claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (except as set forth below), the Family and Medical Leave Act and state and local laws of similar effect, the National Labor Relations Act, Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the New York Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and other state and local laws of similar effect (all as amended); and (iii) any other claim (whether based on federal, state, or local law, statutory or decisional) relating to or arising out of my employment, the terms and conditions of such employment, and/or the termination or separation of such employment, and/or any of the events and decisions relating directly or indirectly to or surrounding the termination of that employment, including but not limited to claims for breach of contract (express or implied), wrongful discharge, detrimental reliance, defamation, whistleblowing, harassment, retaliation, mental distress, emotional distress, physical injury, humiliation or compensatory or punitive damages. 
  
   5 

By virtue of this General Release, I agree that I have waived any damages and other relief available to me (including, without limitation, money damages, equitable relief and reinstatement) with respect to any claim or cause of action waived or released herein.  Nothing herein, however, shall constitute a waiver of claims arising after the date I sign this General Release or the Separation Agreement, claims to enforce the Employment Agreement, my rights to accrued, vested benefits under any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit plan of the Company or its parent companies or subsidiaries (in accordance with the terms of the official plan documents and applicable law), claims for benefits under the Company group medical, dental and vision plans (in accordance with the terms of such plans and applicable law), claims for unemployment or workers compensation benefits, claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or any claim that cannot be waived by law.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute a release of any claim for indemnification for acts or omissions taken or omitted to be taken by me on or prior to August 31, 2016, under the Charter and Bylaws of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  Additionally, nothing in the Separation Agreement or this General Release shall be construed to prevent me from filing a charge with, responding to a subpoena from, or participating in an investigation conducted by, any governmental agency, though I acknowledge and agree that I have waived the right to recover monetary damages and any other relief with respect to the claims I am waiving and releasing in this General Release in connection with any charge or proceeding. 
    
  I acknowledge that I have been given 21 days from the day I received a copy of this General Release and the Separation Agreement to sign these papers and that I have been advised to consult an attorney before signing them. I understand that I have the right to revoke my consent to this General Release and the Separation Agreement for seven days following my signing this General Release and the Separation Agreement.  Provided I do not revoke them, the effective date of this General Release and the Separation Agreement shall be the 8   th    day after I sign them (the  Effective Date ).   
    
  I further state that I have read the foregoing document and the Separation Agreement, that I know and understand the contents thereof, and that I knowingly and voluntarily have signed the same as my own free act. 

WITNESS my hand this ______ day of ______________________, 2016.
