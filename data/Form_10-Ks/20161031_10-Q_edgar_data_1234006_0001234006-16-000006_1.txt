  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
  1. Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
  Gladstone Commercial Corporation is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland on February 14, 2003. We focus on acquiring, owning and managing primarily office and industrial properties. On a selective basis, we may make long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans; however, we do not have any mortgage loans currently outstanding. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by Gladstone Management Corporation, a Delaware corporation, or the Adviser, and administrative services are provided by Gladstone Administration, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or the Administrator, each pursuant to a contractual arrangement with us. Our Adviser and Administrator collectively employ all of our personnel and pay their salaries, benefits, and general expenses directly. Gladstone Commercial Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations through a subsidiary, Gladstone Commercial Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, or the Operating Partnership. 
  All further references herein to  we,   our,   us  and the  Company  mean Gladstone Commercial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the term means only Gladstone Commercial Corporation. 
  Interim Financial Information 
  Our interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted. The year-end balance sheet data presented herein was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included. The interim financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2016. The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or for the full fiscal year. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties, and as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ; however we issued mezzanine equity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which is further described in Note 10.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  ( ASU 2016-02 ), The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to minimally impact our consolidated financial statements as we currently have   four   operating ground lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. We also expect our legal expense to increase as the new standard requires us to expense indirect leasing costs that were previously capitalized to leasing commissions. ASC 2016-02 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-15 and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.   
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-17,  Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  ( ASU 2016-17 ), which amends the consolidation guidance in ASU 2015-02     regarding the treatment of indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-17 and do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU-2015-03 ), which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred financing cost. ASU 2015-03 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We have adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We had unamortized deferred financing fees of   $5.6 million   and   $6.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These costs have been reclassified from deferred financing costs, net, to mortgage notes payable, net, borrowings under line of credit, net, borrowings under term loan facility, net, and Series C mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, net. All periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted. 
  The following table summarizes the retrospective adjustment and the overall impact on the previously reported consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):

2. Related-Party Transactions 
  Gladstone Management and Gladstone Administration 
  We are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator, which collectively employ all of our personnel and pay their salaries, benefits, and general expenses directly. Both our Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of ours, as their parent company is owned and controlled by Mr. David Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer.   Two   of our executive officers, Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Terry Brubaker (our vice chairman and chief operating officer) serve as directors and executive officers of our Adviser and our Administrator. Mr. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary, serves as our Administrator s president. We have an advisory agreement with our Adviser, and an administration agreement with our Administrator, or the Administration Agreement. The services and fees under the advisory agreement and Administration Agreement are described below. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , $  2.0 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, was collectively due to our Adviser and Administrator. 
  Base Management Fee 
  On July 24, 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated advisory agreement, with the Adviser effective July 1, 2015. We subsequently entered into a third amended and restated advisory agreement with the Adviser on July 12, 2016 effective July 1, 2016, or the Advisory Agreement. Our entrance into each of the amended agreements was approved unanimously by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors reviews and considers approving or renewing the agreement with our Adviser each July.    
  Effective July 1, 2015, the calculation of the annual base management fee equals   1.5%   of our adjusted total stockholders  equity, which is our total stockholders  equity (before giving effect to the base management fee and incentive fee), adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses that do not affect realized net income (including impairment charges) and adjusted for any one-time events and certain non-cash items (the later to occur for a given quarter only upon the approval of our Compensation Committee). The fee is calculated and accrued quarterly as   0.375%   per quarter of such adjusted total stockholders  equity figure. Effective July 1, 2016, the definition of adjusted total stockholders' equity in the calculation of the base management fee and the incentive fee (described below) includes total mezzanine equity. All other provisions remained unchanged.  
  Prior to July 1, 2015, our then-existing advisory agreement with the Adviser, provided for an annual base management fee equal to   2.0%   of our common stockholders  equity, which was our total stockholders  equity, less the recorded value of any preferred stock and adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains, losses, or other items that did not affect realized net income (including impairment charges). 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a base management fee of   $1.1 million   and $  2.8 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a base management fee of $  0.9 million   and $  2.6 million  , respectively. 
  Incentive Fee 
  Effective July 1, 2015, the calculation of the incentive fee was revised to reward the Adviser in circumstances where our quarterly Core FFO (defined at the end of this paragraph), before giving effect to any incentive fee, or pre-incentive fee Core FFO, exceeds   2.0%   quarterly, or   8.0%   annualized, of adjusted total stockholders  equity (after giving effect to the base management fee but before giving effect to the incentive fee), or the hurdle amount. Effective July 1, 2016, the definition of adjusted total stockholders' equity includes total mezzanine equity. The Adviser will receive   15.0%   of the amount of our pre-incentive fee Core FFO that exceeds the hurdle amount. However, in no event shall the incentive fee for a particular quarter exceed by   15.0%   (the cap) the average quarterly incentive fee paid by us for the previous   four   quarters (excluding quarters for which no incentive fee was paid). Core FFO (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) is GAAP net income (loss) available to common stockholders, excluding the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization, any realized and unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period, and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP. 
  Prior to July 1, 2015, our then-existing advisory agerement rewarded the Adviser in circumstances where our quarterly FFO, before giving effect to any incentive fee, or pre-incentive fee FFO, exceeded   1.75%  , or   7.0%   annualized, or the hurdle rate, of common stockholders  equity. Funds from operations, or FFO, included any realized capital gains and capital losses, less any distributions paid on preferred stock and Senior Common Stock, but FFO did not include any unrealized capital gains or losses (including impairment charges). The Adviser received   100.0%   of the amount of the pre-incentive fee FFO that exceeded the hurdle rate, but was less than   2.1875%   of our common stockholders  equity. The Adviser also received an incentive fee of   20.0%   of the amount of our pre-incentive fee FFO that exceeded   2.1875%   of common stockholders  equity.

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an incentive fee of   $0.6 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded an incentive fee of $  0.6 million   and $  4.1 million  , respectively, offset by credits related to unconditional, voluntary and irrevocable waivers issued by the Adviser of $  0.0 million   and $  2.5 million  , respectively, resulting in a net incentive fee for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , of $  0.6 million   and $  1.6 million  , respectively. Our Board of Directors accepted the Adviser s offer to waive, on a quarterly basis, a portion of the incentive fee for the nine months covering January 1, 2015 through September 31, 2015 to support the current level of distributions to our stockholders. The Adviser did not waive any portion of the incentive fee for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Waivers cannot be recouped by the Adviser in the future.  
    
  Capital Gain Fee 
  Under the Advisory Agreement, we will pay to the Adviser a capital gains-based incentive fee that will be calculated and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the agreement). In determining the capital gain fee, we will calculate aggregate realized capital gains and aggregate realized capital losses for the applicable time period. For this purpose, aggregate realized capital gains and losses, if any, equals the realized gain or loss calculated by the difference between the sales price of the property, less any costs to sell the property and the current gross value of the property (which is calculated as the original acquisition price plus any subsequent non-reimbursed capital improvements). At the end of the fiscal year, if this number is positive, then the capital gain fee payable for such time period shall equal   15.0%   of such amount.   No   capital gain fee was recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Termination Fee 
  The Advisory Agreement includes a termination fee whereby, in the event of our termination of the agreement without cause (with   120   days  prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), a termination fee would be payable to the Adviser equal to two times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by the Adviser during the 24-month period prior to such termination. A termination fee is also payable if the Adviser terminates the agreement after the Company has defaulted and applicable cure periods have expired. The agreement may also be terminated for cause by us (with   30   days  prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), with no termination fee payable. Cause is defined in the agreement to include if the Adviser breaches any material provisions of the agreement, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Adviser, dissolution of the Adviser and fraud or misappropriation of funds. 
  Administration Agreement 
  Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator s expenses in performing services to us, including, but not limited to, rent and the salaries and benefits of its personnel, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator s president), and their respective staffs. Our allocable portion of the Administrator s expenses is derived by multiplying our Administrator s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time the Administrator s employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under contractual agreements. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an administration fee of   $0.3 million   and $  1.1 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded an administration fee of $  0.3 million   and $  1.1 million  , respectively. Our Board of Directors reviews and considers approving or renewing the agreement with our Administrator each July. 
  Gladstone Securities 
  Gladstone Securities, LLC, or Gladstone Securities, is a privately held broker dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is an affiliate of ours, as its parent company is owned and controlled by Mr. David Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Gladstone also serves on the board of managers of Gladstone Securities.

Dealer Manager Agreement 
  In connection with the offering of our Senior Common Stock (see Note 10,  Stockholders  and Mezzanine Equity,  for further details) we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement, dated March 25, 2011, or the Dealer Manager Agreement, with Gladstone Securities pursuant to which Gladstone Securities agreed to act as our exclusive dealer manager in connection with the offering. The Dealer Manager Agreement terminated according to its terms on   March 28, 2015  , requiring us to write-off   $0.1 million   of deferred offering costs to general and administrative expense. Pursuant to the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement, Gladstone Securities was entitled to receive a sales commission in the amount of   7.0%   of the gross proceeds of the shares of Senior Common Stock sold, plus a dealer manager fee in the amount of   3.0%   of the gross proceeds of the shares of Senior Common Stock sold. In addition, we agreed to indemnify Gladstone Securities against various liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws. We made approximately   $0.3 million   of payments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , to Gladstone Securities pursuant to this agreement. 
  Mortgage Financing Arrangement Agreement 
    
  We entered into an agreement with Gladstone Securities, effective June 18, 2013, for it to act as our non-exclusive agent to assist us with arranging mortgage financing for properties we own. In connection with this engagement, Gladstone Securities may from time to time solicit the interest of various commercial real estate lenders or recommend to us third party lenders offering credit products or packages that are responsive to our needs. We pay Gladstone Securities a financing fee in connection with the services it provides to us for securing mortgage financing on any of our properties. The amount of these financing fees, which are payable upon closing of the financing, are based on a percentage of the amount of the mortgage, generally ranging from   0.15%   to a maximum of   1.0%   of the mortgage obtained. The amount of the financing fees may be reduced or eliminated, as determined by us and Gladstone Securities, after taking into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, the involvement of any third party brokers and market conditions. We paid financing fees to Gladstone Securities of   $0.05 million   and   $0.2 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which are included in mortgage notes payable, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, or   0.28%   and   0.36%   of total mortgages secured. We paid financing fees to Gladstone Securities of   $0.02 million   and   $0.2 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which are included in mortgage notes payable, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, or   0.3%   of total mortgages secured in each period. Our Board of Directors renewed the agreement for an additional year, through August 31, 2017, at its July 2016 meeting.

3. Loss per Share of Common Stock 
  The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share of common stock for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We computed basic loss per share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted loss per share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , reflects additional shares of common stock related to our convertible senior common stock (if the effect would be dilutive), that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued, as well as an adjustment to net income available to common stockholders as applicable to common stockholders that would result from their assumed issuance (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts).

    We excluded   800,116   shares of convertible senior common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, because it was anti-dilutive. We also excluded   828,444   shares and   791,582   shares of convertible senior common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, because it was anti-dilutive.

5. Real Estate Dispositions, Held for Sale, and Impairment Charges 
  Real Estate Dispositions 
  On May 16, 2016, we completed the sale of our Dayton, Ohio property for   $0.2 million  . There was   no   gain or loss recognized on this sale. We considered this office asset to be non-core to our long term strategy, and we re-deployed the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt.  
  On August 24, 2016, we completed the sale of our property located in Rock Falls, Illinois, and our   two   properties located in Angola, Indiana for an aggregate of   $3.0 million   and recognized a loss of   $0.02 million  . We considered these industrial assets to be non-core to our long term strategy, and we re-deployed the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt. 
  Per ASU 2014-08, "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity," our 2016 dispositions were not classified as discontinued operations because they do not represent a strategic shift in operations, nor will they have a major effect on our operations and financial results.  
  The table below summarizes the components of operating income from the real estate and related assets disposed of during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively (dollars in thousands):

Real Estate Held for Sale 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we classified   five   properties (located in Montgomery, Alabama, Hazelwood, Missouri, Syracuse, New York, Toledo, Ohio and South Hadley, Massachusetts) as held for sale under the provisions of ASC 360-10,  Property, Plant, and Equipment.  ASC 360-10 requires that the assets and liabilities of any such properties, be presented separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the current period presented, and that we cease recording depreciation and amortization expense. We consider all   five   of these assets to be non-core to our long term strategy. We have executed sales agreements for the Montgomery, Alabama, Hazelwood, Missouri, and Toledo, Ohio properties, and are actively looking for buyers for the Syracuse, New York and South Hadley, Massachusetts properties. We anticipate the Hazelwood, Missouri property sale will close during second quarter 2017, and we currently anticipate the remaining   four   properties to sell during the fourth quarter 2016.  
  Per ASU 2014-08, our assets classified as held for sale were not classified as discontinued operations because they do not represent a strategic shift in our operations, nor will they have a major effect on our operations and financial results.  
    
  The table below summarizes the components of income from real estate and related assets held for sale (dollars in thousands):

Impairment Charges 
  We performed an evaluation and analysis on our held for sale properties and recorded impairment charges of   $1.8 million   and   $2.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $0.6 million   for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We recognized impairment charges of   $0.04 million   on our Dayton, Ohio property and   $0.02 million   on our Angola, Indiana and Rock Falls, Illinois properties, which were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We also recognized   $0.2 million  ,   $0.7 million   and   $1.1 million   of impairment charges on our Montgomery, Alabama, Hazelwood, Missouri and South Hadley, Massachusetts properties, respectively, which are all classified as held for sale in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recognized impairment on these assets as the hold period for these assets was shortened when they met the definition of held for sale.  
  We recognized   $0.6 million   of impairment charges on our Dayton, Ohio property during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This property was sold in May 2016. 
  The fair values for the above properties were calculated using Level 3 inputs which were calculated using an estimated sales price, less estimated costs to sell. The estimated sales price was determined using an executed purchase and sale agreement,  auction house price ranges and real estate broker guidance. 
   
  6. Mortgage Note Receivable 
  On July 25, 2014, we closed a   $5.6 million   second mortgage development loan for the construction of an   81,371   square foot, build-to-suit transitional care facility located on a major hospital campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Subsequently, on April 14, 2015, we closed an additional   $0.3 million   interim financing loan for the development of the Phoenix, Arizona property. Construction was completed in July 2015 and we earned   9.0%   interest, paid currently in cash, on the loan during construction and through maturity. Prior to completion of the facility, we were granted a right of first offer to purchase the property at fair value. We elected not to purchase the property, and received an exit fee upon maturity of the loan in an amount sufficient for us to earn an internal rate of return of   22.0%   on the second mortgage development loan, inclusive of interest earned. We recognized $  0.4 million   in both cash interest income and exit fee revenue during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We recognized $  0.3 million   and $  0.8 million  , respectively, in both cash interest income and exit fee revenue during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The principal balance of the loans and all associated interest and exit fee revenue was received in January 2016. We currently have   no   mortgage notes receivable outstanding.

Mortgage Notes Payable 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   43   mortgage notes payable, collateralized by a total of   71   properties with a net book value of   $638.5 million  . Gladstone Commercial Corporation has limited recourse liabilities that could result from any one or more of the following circumstances: a borrower voluntarily filing for bankruptcy, improper conveyance of a property, fraud or material misrepresentation, misapplication or misappropriation of rents, security deposits, insurance proceeds or condemnation proceeds, or physical waste or damage to the property resulting from a borrower s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Gladstone Commercial Corporation has full recourse for   $7.4 million   of the mortgages notes payable outstanding, or   1.7%   of the outstanding balance. We will also indemnify lenders against claims resulting from the presence of hazardous substances or activity involving hazardous substances in violation of environmental laws on a property.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repaid   6   mortgages, collateralized by   12   properties, and issued   5   long-term mortgages, collateralized by   10   properties, which are summarized below (dollars in thousands): 

(1) 
    We refinanced maturing debt on our Chalfont, Pennsylvania, Big Flats, New York and Franklin and Eatontown, New Jersey properties, which was originally set to mature during second quarter 2016. We entered into an interest rate cap agreement with Key Bank, which caps LIBOR at   3%   through   March 1, 2019  . 
              (2) 
    We refinanced maturing debt on our Coppell, Texas property, which was originally set to mature during second quarter 2016. We pooled the new mortgage debt with unencumbered properties located in Allen and Colleyville, Texas. We entered into an interest rate cap agreement with Great Southern Bank, which caps LIBOR at   2.5%   through April 22, 2019. 
              (3) 
    We repaid our   $10.7 million   mortgage on our Springfield, Missouri property that was originally set to mature on July 1, 2016, and we repaid our   $11.8 million   mortgage on our Wichita, Kansas, Clintonville, Wisconsin, Angola, Indiana and Rock Falls, Illinois properties that was originally set to mature on May 5, 2016. We repaid both mortgages using existing cash on hand and borrowings from our line of credit.

              (6) 
    We borrowed   $14.1 million   to acquire the property in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

(1) This figure does not include   $0.2 million   of premiums and (discounts), net and   $5.0 million   of deferred financing costs, which are reflected in mortgage notes payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
  Interest Rate Cap Agreements 
  We have entered into interest rate cap agreements that cap the interest rate on certain of our variable-rate notes payable. We have adopted the fair value measurement provisions for our financial instruments recorded at fair value. The fair value guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Generally, we will estimate the fair value of our interest rate caps, in the absence of observable market data, using estimates of value including estimated remaining life, counterparty credit risk, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our interest rate cap agreements were valued using Level 2 inputs. 
  The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements is recorded in other assets on our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. We record changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements quarterly based on the current market valuations at quarter end as interest expense on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the key terms of each interest rate cap agreement (dollars in thousands): 

The fair value of all mortgage notes payable outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   was   $454.6 million  , as compared to the carrying value stated above of   $449.3 million  . The fair value is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using management s estimate of market interest rates on long-term debt with comparable terms and loan to value ratios. The fair value was calculated using Level 3 inputs of the hierarchy established by ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.

Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility 
  In August 2013, we procured a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Line of Credit, with KeyBank National Association (serving as a revolving lender, a letter of credit issuer and an administrative agent). On October 5, 2015, we expanded our Line of Credit to   $85.0 million  , extended the maturity date one-year through August 2018, with a   one   year extension option through August 2019 and entered into a   $25.0 million   Term Loan Facility (discussed below). The interest rate on the Line of Credit was also reduced by 25 basis points at each of the leverage tiers.  
  In connection with the Line of Credit expansion in October 2015 mentioned above, we added a   $25.0 million  ,   five   year term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, which was fully drawn at closing and matures in October 2020. The Term Loan Facility is subject to the same leverage tiers as the Line of Credit; however the interest rate at each leverage tier is five basis points lower. We have the option to repay the Term Loan Facility in full, or in part, at any time without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date.  
  The total maximum commitment under the two facilities, including the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility is $  150.0 million  . The bank syndicate is comprised of KeyBank, Comerica Bank, Fifth Third Bank, US Bank and Huntington Bank.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $72.3 million   outstanding under our Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately   3.01%   and   $2.5 million   outstanding under letters of credit at a weighted average interest rate of   2.5%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum additional amount we could draw under the Line of Credit was   $27.4 million  . We were in compliance with all covenants under the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The amount outstanding under the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility approximates fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , as the debt is variable rate. 
   
  8. Mandatorily Redeemable Term Preferred Stock 
  In February 2012, we completed a public offering of   1,540,000   shares of   7.125%   Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value   $0.001   per share, or the Term Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of   $25.00   per share. Gross proceeds of the offering totaled   $38.5 million   and net proceeds, after deducting offering expenses borne by us, were   $36.7 million  .  The shares of the Term Preferred Stock had a mandatory redemption date of January 31, 2017.  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of  the Term Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we wrote-off unamortized offering costs of   $0.06 million   and   $0.2 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which were recorded to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  The Term Preferred Stock was recorded as a liability in accordance with ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,  which states that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments should be classified as liabilities and therefore the related dividend payments are treated as a component of interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

In February 2016, we amended our common ATM program, or the Amended Common ATM, with Cantor Fitzgerald. The amendment increased the amount of shares of common stock that we may offer and sell through Cantor Fitzgerald, to   $160.0 million  . All other terms of the common ATM program remained unchanged.

  Series D Preferred Stock:     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we entered into purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and broker dealers whereby we agreed to sell a total of 2,273,725 shares of our 7.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share or the Series D Preferred, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, in registered direct placements.  Our total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting offering expenses, were $55.1 million. The proceeds were used to redeem $38.5 million of our Term Preferred Stock, which represents all of our then outstanding shares of such stock, with the remainder used to repay outstanding debt.   The Series D Preferred is classified as mezzanine equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheet because it is redeemable at the option of the shareholder upon a change of control  of greater than 50% in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99 "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,"     which requires mezzanine equity classification for preferred stock issuances with redemption features which are outside of the control of the issuer. A change in control of our company outside of our control is only possible if a tender offer is accepted by over 90% of our shareholders. All other change in control situations would require input from our Board of Directors.  We will periodically evaluate the likelihood that a change of control greater than 50% will take place, and if we deem this probable, we would adjust the Series D Preferred presented in mezzanine equity to their redemption value, with the offset to gain (loss) on extinguishment. We currently believe the likelihood of a change of control greater than 50% is remote. 
  Series D Preferred Stock ATM  :  In June 2016, we entered into an open market sales agreement, or the Series D Preferred ATM, with Cantor Fitzgerald, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer to sell shares of our Series D Preferred, having an aggregate offering price of up to   $50.0 million  , through Cantor Fitzgerald, acting as sales agent and/or principal. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   502,000   shares of our Series D Preferred for net proceeds of $  12.5 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining capacity to sell up to $  37.3 million   of Series D Preferred under the Series D Preferred ATM.

Leasing Activity 
  On October 10, 2016, we entered into a lease amendment with the tenant occupying our Vance, Alabama property.  We agreed to fund a   $7.0 million   expansion which would add   75,000   square feet to our property, bringing the property to a total of   245,000   square feet. Upon completion of the expansion project, we will enter into a new   10  -year lease.  
  On October 18, 2016, we extended the lease with the tenant occupying our property located in Wichita, Kansas. The lease covering this property was extended for an additional   five years   through September 30, 2022. The lease was originally set to expire on September 30, 2017. The lease provides for prescribed rent escalations over its life, with annualized straight line rents of approximately  $0.8 million  . In connection with the extension of the lease and modification of certain terms of the lease, we committed to   $0.3 million   in tenant improvements.  
  Officer Appointment 
  On October 19, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Michael Sodo to the office of Chief Financial Officer, effective November 1, 2016.

  General 
  We are an externally-advised real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland on February 14, 2003. We focus on acquiring, owning, and managing primarily office and industrial properties. On a selective basis, we may make long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans. Our properties are geographically diversified and our tenants cover a broad cross section of business sectors and range in size from small to very large private and public companies. We actively communicate with buyout funds, real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio. We target secondary growth markets that possess favorable economic growth trends, diversified industries, and growing population and employment. 
  We have historically entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, purchase agreements for real estate having net leases with terms of approximately 7 to 15 years and built in rental rate increases. Under a net lease, the tenant is required to pay all operating, maintenance, repair and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property. 
  As of   October 31, 2016  : 

the weighted average remaining term of our mortgage debt was   6.4   years and the weighted average interest rate was   4.71%  ; and 
                
    the average remaining lease term of the portfolio was   7.9   years. 

Business Environment 
  In the United States, vacancy rates have decreased for both office and industrial properties in most markets, as increased user demand has led to improved conditions. In fact, vacancy rates in many markets have been reduced to levels seen at the peak before the most recent recession and rental rates have increased in many primary and secondary markets. This condition has led to a rise in construction activity for both office and industrial properties in many markets; however, vacancy rates in certain secondary and tertiary markets are still higher than pre-recession levels as job growth has yet to return to all areas of the country even though the published unemployment rate has dropped over the past 12 months. Interest rates have been volatile since the beginning of the year and although interest rates are still relatively low, lenders have increased their required spreads and overall financing costs for fixed rate mortgages appear to be on the rise. At the beginning of the year several research firm surveys reflected that the current real estate cycle may be peaking and that publicly traded real estate investment trusts could be net sellers. Through the first nine months of the year, statistics from reputed international investment sales companies reflect that overall investment volume is reported to be down by as much as 20% compared to the same period in 2015.

From a more macro-economic perspective, the strength of the global economy and U.S. economy in particular continue to be uncertain with increased volatility due to the recent vote in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, the oversupply of energy worldwide and an apparent global economic slowdown. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding the ability of the federal government to address its fiscal condition in both the near and long term as well as other geo-political issues has increased domestic and global instability. These developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may adversely affect our ability to access both the equity and debt markets and could have an adverse effect on our tenants as well. 
  We continue to focus on re-leasing vacant space, renewing upcoming lease expirations, re-financing upcoming loan maturities, and acquiring additional properties. Currently, we only have one fully vacant building, which is located in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and a total of five partially vacant buildings.  
  We have   three   expiring leases in 2017, which accounts for   0.7%   of rental income recognized during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   three   expiring leases in 2018, which accounts for   1.3%   of rental income recognized during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Our available vacant space at   September 30, 2016   represents   2.3%   of our total square footage and the annual carrying costs on the vacant space, including real estate taxes and property operating expenses, are approximately $0.7 million. We continue to actively seek new tenants for these properties. 
  Our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon our ability to procure external financing. Our principal sources of external financing generally include the issuance of equity securities, long-term mortgage loans secured by properties and borrowings under our line of credit, or the Line of Credit. While lenders  credit standards have tightened, long-term mortgages are readily obtainable. We continue to look to regional banks and insurance companies, in addition to the collateralized mortgage backed securities market, or the CMBS market, to issue mortgages to finance our real estate activities. 
  In addition to obtaining funds through borrowing, we have been active in the equity markets during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We have issued shares of both common and preferred stock through our at-the-market programs, or ATM Programs, pursuant to our open market sale agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald, discussed in more detail below and completed an underwritten offering of Series D Preferred.

During 2016, we continued to execute our capital recycling program, whereby we opportunistically sell properties outside of our core markets, and redeploy proceeds to fund property acquisitions located in our target secondary growth markets.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold four non-core properties, and applied the proceeds towards outstanding debt, and property acquisitions. We will continue to sell non-core properties under advantageous circumstances.

Diversity of Our Portfolio 
  Our Adviser seeks to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, industry or geographic market. By diversifying our portfolio, our Adviser intends to reduce the adverse effect on our portfolio of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular industry or geographic market. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our largest tenant comprised only   5.7%   of total rental income. The table below reflects the breakdown of our total rental income by tenant industry classification for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (dollars in thousands):

Our Adviser and Administrator 
  Our Adviser is led by a management team with extensive experience purchasing real estate and originating mortgage loans. Our Adviser and Administrator are controlled by Mr. David Gladstone, who is also our chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Gladstone also serves as the chairman and chief executive officer of both our Adviser and Administrator. Mr. Terry Lee Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer, is also the vice chairman and chief operating officer of our Adviser and Administrator. Mr. Robert Cutlip, our president, is also an executive managing director of our Adviser. Gladstone Administration, LLC, or our Administrator, employs our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator s president) and their respective staffs. 
    
  Our Adviser and Administrator also provide investment advisory and administrative services, respectively, to certain of our affiliates, including, but not limited to, Gladstone Capital Corporation and Gladstone Investment Corporation, both publicly-traded business development companies, as well as Gladstone Land Corporation, a publicly-traded REIT that primarily invests in farmland. With the exception of Ms. Danielle Jones, our chief financial officer through November 1, 2016, and Mr. Michael Sodo, our incoming chief financial officer effective November 1, 2016, Mr. Jay Beckhorn, our treasurer, and Mr. Robert Cutlip, our president, all of our executive officers and all of our directors serve as either directors or executive officers, or both, of Gladstone Capital Corporation and Gladstone Investment Corporation. In addition, with the exception of Mr. Cutlip, Ms. Jones and Mr. Sodo, all of our executive officers and all of our directors, serve as either directors or executive officers, or both, of Gladstone Land Corporation. In the future, our Adviser may provide investment advisory services to other companies, both public and private. 
   
  Advisory and Administration Agreements 
  We are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator. Our Adviser and Administrator employ all of our personnel and pay their payroll, benefits and general expenses directly. We have an investment advisory agreement with our Adviser, and an administration agreement with our Administrator, or the Administration Agreement. 
  Under the terms of the advisory agreement, we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit. Examples of these expenses include legal, accounting, interest on short-term debt and mortgages, tax preparation, directors  and officers  insurance, stock transfer services, stockholder-related fees, consulting and related fees. In addition, we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business, which include real estate brokerage fees, mortgage placement fees, lease-up fees and transaction structuring fees (although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers). 
  Advisory Agreement 
  On July 24, 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated advisory agreement, or the Second Amended Advisory Agreement, with the Adviser that was effective July 1, 2015. We subsequently entered into a third amended and restated advisory agreement with the Adviser on July 12, 2016 that was effective July 1, 2016, or the Advisory Agreement. Our entrance into each of the amended agreements was approved unanimously by our Board of Directors.

Effective July 1, 2015, the calculation of the annual base management fee was revised to equal 1.5% of our total stockholders  equity, (before giving effect to the base management and incentive fee), adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses that do not affect realized net income (including impairment charges), adjusted for any one-time events and certain non-cash items (only after approval of our Compensation Committee), or adjusted total stockholders  equity. The fee is calculated and accrued quarterly as 0.375% per quarter of such adjusted total stockholders  equity figure. Effective July 1, 2016, the definition of adjusted stockholders' equity was redefined to include total mezzanine equity, in the calculation of both the base management and incentive fee. All other provisions of the Second Amended Advisory Agreement remained unchanged. 
  Effective July 1, 2015, the calculation of the annual incentive fee was revised to reward the Adviser if our quarterly Core FFO (defined below), before giving effect to any incentive fee, or pre-incentive fee Core FFO, exceeds 2.0%, or 8.0% annualized, of adjusted total stockholders  equity (after giving effect to the base management fee but before giving effect to the incentive fee), or the hurdle amount. The Adviser receives 15.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee Core FFO that exceeds the hurdle amount. However, in no event shall the incentive fee for a particular quarter exceed the average quarterly incentive fee paid by us for the previous four quarters by greater than 15.0% (excluding quarters for which no incentive fee was paid). Core FFO (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) is GAAP net income (loss) available to common stockholders, excluding the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization, any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period, and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP. 
  A capital gains-based incentive fee was instituted that is calculated and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination). In determining the capital gain fee, we calculate aggregate realized capital gains and aggregate realized capital losses for the applicable time period. For this purpose, aggregate realized capital gains and losses, if any, equals the realized gain or loss calculated by the difference between the sales price of the property, less any costs to sell the property and the current gross value of the property (which is calculated as the original acquisition price plus any subsequent non-reimbursed capital improvements). At the end of the fiscal year, if this number is positive, then the capital gain fee payable for such time period shall equal 15.0% of such amount. 
  The Advisory Agreement includes a termination fee where, in the event of a termination without cause (with 120 days  prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), a termination fee would be payable to the Adviser equal to two times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by the Adviser during the 24-month period prior to such termination. A termination fee is also payable if the Adviser terminates the agreement after the Company has defaulted and applicable cure periods have expired. The agreement may also be terminated for cause (with 30 days  prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), with no termination fee payable. Cause is defined in the agreement to include if the Adviser breaches any material provisions of the Agreement, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Adviser, dissolution of the Adviser and fraud or misappropriation of funds. 
  Administration Agreement 
  Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of our Administrator s overhead expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us, including, but not limited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our personnel, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator s president), and their respective staffs. Our allocable portion of the Administrator s expenses is generally derived by multiplying our Administrator s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time the Administrator s employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under contractual agreements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., or GAAP, requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties, and as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ; however we issued mezzanine equity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which is further described in Note 10 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations 
  The weighted average yield on our total portfolio, which was 8.6% as of   September 30, 2016   and 8.7% as of   September 30, 2015  , is calculated by taking the annualized straight-line rents, reflected as rental income on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, of each acquisition since inception as a percentage of the acquisition cost. The weighted average yield does not account for the interest expense incurred on the mortgages placed on our properties. 
    
  A comparison of our operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  :

    Diluted FFO available to common stockholders was not previously adjusted for the income impact of the assumed conversion of senior common stock, in accordance with ASC 260 ( Earnings per Share ). This adjustment has increased Diluted FFO available to common stockholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   by $0.01 per share.

Same Store Analysis 
  For the purposes of the following discussion, same store properties are properties we owned as of January 1,   2015  , which have not been subsequently vacated, or disposed of. Acquired and disposed of properties are properties which were either acquired, disposed of or classified as held for sale at any point subsequent to   December 31, 2014  . Properties with vacancy are properties that were fully vacant or had greater than 5% vacancy, based on square footage, at any point subsequent to January 1,   2015  . 
  Operating Revenues 

Rental revenue from same store properties increased slightly for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily because of additional rental income received from lease renewals at our Duncan, South Carolina and Indianapolis, Indiana properties, which were executed in   2015  . Rental revenue increased for acquired and disposed of properties for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because we acquired three properties subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , and the inclusion of a full nine months of rental revenue in   2016   for five properties acquired during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Rental revenue decreased for our properties with vacancy because the Newburyport, Massachusetts property went vacant in May 2015, coupled with reduced rent in our partially vacant Maple Heights, Ohio property; this was offset by increased rents at our Baytown, Texas, Burnsville, Minnesota, Bolingbrook, Illinois and Raleigh, North Carolina properties as a result of leasing vacant space.

The decrease in same store tenant recovery revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , is a result of decreased recoveries from gross leases at certain of our properties, due to lower property operating expenses at certain properties during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The decrease in tenant recovery revenues on acquired and disposed of properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , is due to a decrease in recoveries from properties sold subsequent to September 30, 2015. The increase in tenant recovery revenues on acquired and disposed of properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , is a result of increased recoveries from gross leases at certain of our properties acquired during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Interest income from mortgage notes receivable decreased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because the mortgage note was repaid in full in January 2016. 
  Operating Expenses    

Depreciation and amortization increased slightly for same store properties for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to depreciation on capital projects completed subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , coupled with amortization on leasing commissions for renewed leases with   2015   and   2016   expirations. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for acquired and disposed of properties during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because of the three properties acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015   and the inclusion of a full nine months of depreciation and amortization recorded during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   for five properties acquired during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Property operating expenses consist of franchise taxes, management fees, insurance, ground lease payments, property maintenance and repair expenses paid on behalf of certain of our properties. The decrease in property operating expenses for same store properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,  is a result of a decrease in operating expenses incurred at properties subject to a gross lease, offset by increased franchise tax expense at certain of our properties. The slight increase in property operating expenses for same store properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is a result of the increase in operating expenses incurred at properties subject to a gross lease, coupled with increased franchise tax expense at certain of our properties. The increase in property operating expenses for acquired and disposed of properties for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , is primarily a result of property operating expenses incurred at properties subject to a gross lease which were acquired during and subsequent to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Acquisition related expenses primarily consist of legal fees and fees incurred for third-party reports prepared in connection with potential acquisitions and our due diligence analyses related thereto. Acquisition related expenses increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to timing of expenses incurred, coupled with a larger acquisition pipeline. Acquisition related expenses decreased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   because we only acquired two properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We acquired five properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The base management fee paid to the Adviser increased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because of the increase in total adjusted stockholders' equity in the past 12 months. The calculation of the base management fee is described in detail above within    Advisory and Administration Agreements.  
  The net incentive fee paid to the Adviser decreased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , because the hurdle amount increased faster than pre-incentive fee FFO, resulting in a lower incentive fee. The increase in the hurdle amount is a result of  an increase in total adjusted stockholders' equity, due to the preferred shares issued during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The net incentive fee paid to the Adviser increased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because of an increase in pre-incentive fee FFO, coupled with a reduction in the credit to incentive fee. The increase in pre-incentive fee FFO was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from the proeprties acquired during and subsequent to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The calculation of the incentive fee is described in detail above within    Advisory and Administration Agreements.  
  The administration fee paid to the Administrator decreased slightly for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to using a lower share of our administrator's resources during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The administration fee paid to the Administrator increased slightly for the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to using a higher share of our administrator's resources, coupled with an increase in the overall cost of the Administrator's services during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  General and administrative expenses decreased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of a decrease in professional fees. 
  The impairment loss for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was from the impairment recorded in connection with three of the properties that were classified as held for sale, and the four properties that were sold during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The impairment loss for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was from the impairment recorded in connection with the Dayton, Ohio property. This property was sold during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Other Income and Expenses 
  Interest expense decreased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily a result of refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates which were completed subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . During the previous 12 months, we have refinanced $74.6 million in mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0% with $31.6 million of new mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.0%, coupled with reduced interest expense on our long-term financings from amortizing and balloon principal payments made during the past 12 months. This is partially offset by interest on the $27.8 million of mortgage debt issued in the past 12 months to finance new acquisitions. 
  Distributions attributable to Term Preferred Stock decreased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Term Preferred Stock during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Other income increased during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , because of insurance proceeds received at our Dayton, Ohio property. Other income increased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , because of $0.3 million of settlement income related to deferred capital projects received from the tenant that vacated our property located in Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
  Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders 
  Net loss attributable to common stockholders increased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily because of the impairment loss recorded in connection with the properties that were classified as held for sale during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , offset by an increase in rental income from the properties acquired over the past 12 months coupled with a decrease in interest expense from refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates which were completed subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  Our sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our Line of Credit and issuing additional equity securities. Our available liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  , was $  36.1 million  , including $  8.7 million   in cash and cash equivalents and an available borrowing capacity of   $27.4 million   under our Line of Credit. Our available borrowing capacity under the Line of Credit has increased to   $38.9 million   as of   October 31, 2016  . 
  Future Capital Needs 
  We actively seek conservative investments that are likely to produce income to pay distributions to our stockholders. We intend to use the proceeds received from future equity raised and debt capital borrowed to continue to invest in industrial, and office real property and to a lesser extent medical real property, make mortgage loans, or pay down outstanding borrowings under our Line of Credit. Accordingly, to ensure that we are able to effectively execute our business strategy, we routinely review our liquidity requirements and continually evaluate all potential sources of liquidity. Our short-term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to fund our distributions to stockholders, pay the debt service costs on our existing long-term mortgages, refinancing maturing debt and fund our current operating costs. Our long-term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to grow and maintain our portfolio of investments. 
  We believe that our available liquidity is sufficient to fund our distributions to stockholders, pay the debt service costs on our existing long-term mortgages and fund our current operating costs in the near term. We also believe we will be able to refinance our mortgage debt as it matures. Additionally, to satisfy our short-term obligations, we may request credits to our management fees that are issued from our Adviser, although our Adviser is under no obligation to provide any such credits, either in whole or in part. We further believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with the financing capital available to us in the future are sufficient to fund our long-term liquidity needs.

Equity Capital 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we raised net proceeds of (i)   $17.7 million   of common equity under our Amended Common ATM programs with Cantor Fitzgerald at a weighted average share price of $  17.09  , (ii) $  2.8 million   of preferred equity under our Series A and B Preferred ATM with Cantor Fitzgerald at a weighted average share price of $25.00, (iii) $55.1 million of preferred equity in a private placement with our  newly issued Series D Preferred Stock and (iv) $  12.5 million   under our Series D Preferred ATM. We used these proceeds to redeem all outstanding shares of our Term Preferred Stock, to fund our new acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. 
  As of   October 31, 2016  , we have the ability to raise up to $403.8 million of additional equity capital through the sale and issuance of securities that are registered under our universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-208953), or the Universal Shelf, in one or more future public offerings. Of the $403.8 million of available capacity under our Universal Shelf, approximately $139.4 million of common stock is reserved for additional sales under our Amended Common ATM, approximately $37.2 million of preferred stock is reserved for additional sales under our Series A and B Preferred ATM, and approximately $33.8 million is reserved for additional sales under our Series D Preferred ATM as of   October 31, 2016  . We expect to continue to use our ATM programs as a source of liquidity for 2016. 
  Debt Capital 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had mortgage notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of   $449.3 million  , collateralized by a total of   71   properties with a remaining weighted average maturity of   6.4   years. The weighted-average interest rate on the mortgage notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   was   4.71%  . 
  We continue to see banks and other non-bank lenders willing to issue mortgages. Consequently, we are focused on obtaining mortgages through regional banks, non-bank lenders and the CMBS market. 
    
  We have mortgage debt in the aggregate principal amount of   $10.2 million   payable during the remainder of   2016   and   $70.4 million   payable during   2017  . The   2016   principal amounts payable include both amortizing principal payments and one balloon principal payment due in December of   2016  . We anticipate being able to refinance our mortgages that come due during   2016   and   2017   with a combination of new mortgage debt and the issuance of additional equity securities.  We have successfully refinanced $105.0 million of debt over the past 18 months with either new mortgage debt or by generating additional availability by adding  properties to our unsecured pool under our Line of Credit. In addition, we have raised substantial equity under our ATM programs and plan to continue to use these programs. 
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $29.8 million  , as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $24.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily a result of an increase in rental receipts from acquisitions completed subsequent to   September 30, 2015   and a decrease in interest expense from refinanced mortgages during the previous 12 months, partially offset by leasing commissions paid, coupled with an increase in operating expenses. The majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments and operating expense recoveries that we receive from our tenants. We utilize this cash to fund our property-level operating expenses and use the excess cash primarily for debt and interest payments on our mortgage notes payable, interest payments on our Line of Credit and 5-year term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, distributions to our stockholders, management fees to our Adviser, Administration fees to our Administrator and other entity-level operating expenses. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $35.2 million  , which primarily consisted of the acquisition of two properties and tenant improvements performed at certain of our properties, partially offset by the repayment of our mortgage note receivable, coupled with proceeds from the four properties sold, as compared to net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , of   $76.5 million  , which primarily consisted of the acquisition of five properties, coupled with tenant improvements performed at certain of our properties. 
  During 2016, we have been executing our capital recycling program, whereby we opportunistically sell properties outside of our core markets, and use proceeds to repay outstanding debt, and fund mission critical property acquisitions located in our target secondary growth markets. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold four non-core properties, and applied the proceeds towards outstanding debt, and property acquisitions. We will continue to sell non-core properties under advantageous circumstances.

Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $9.0 million  , which primarily consisted of the sale of both common and preferred stock and the issuance of new mortgage notes, offset by the redemption in full of our Term Preferred Stock, distributions paid to our stockholders and principal repayments on mortgage notes payable. Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was   $46.7 million  , which primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock and issuance of mortgage notes payable, partially offset by distributions paid to our stockholders and principal repayments on mortgage notes payable. 
  Line of Credit 
  In August 2013, we procured our Line of Credit with KeyBank (serving as a revolving lender, a letter of credit issuer and an administrative agent). In October 2015, we expanded our Line of Credit to $85.0 million, extended the maturity date one year through August 2018, with a one year extension option through August 2019, and entered into a Term Loan Facility (discussed below). The interest rate on the revolving line of credit was also reduced by 25 basis points at each of the leverage tiers and the total maximum commitment under the two facilities, including the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility, was increased from $100.0 million to $150.0 million. We also added three new lenders to the bank syndicate, which is now comprised of KeyBank, Comerica Bank, Fifth Third Bank, US Bank and Huntington Bank. We were subject to a payment of $0.5 million for the modification of the agreement. 
  In connection with the Line of Credit expansion discussed above, we added a $25.0 million, five-year, Term Loan Facility, which matures in October 2020. The Term Loan Facility is subject to the same leverage tiers as the Line of Credit, however the interest rate at each leverage tier is five basis points lower. We have the option to repay the Term Loan Facility in full, or in part, at any time without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $72.3 million   outstanding under our Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately   3.01%   and   $2.5 million   outstanding under letters of credit at a weighted average interest rate of   2.5%  . As of   October 31, 2016  , the maximum additional amount we could draw under the Line of Credit was   $38.9 million  . We were in compliance with all covenants under the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table reflects our material contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Debt obligations represent borrowings under our Line of Credit, which represents   $47.3 million   of the debt obligation due in 2018, Term Loan Facility, which represents $25.0 million of the debt obligation due in 2020, and mortgage notes payable that were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . This figure does not include   $0.2 million   of premiums and (discounts), net and   $5.6 million   of deferred financing costs, net, which are reflected in mortgage notes payable, net, borrowings under Line of Credit, net and borrowings under Term Loan Facility, net on the consolidated balance sheet. 
              (2) 
    Interest on debt obligations includes estimated interest on borrowings under our Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility and mortgage notes payable. The balance and interest rate on our Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility is variable; thus, the amount of interest calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    Operating lease obligations represent the ground lease payments due on our Tulsa, Oklahoma, Dartmouth, Massachusetts, Springfield, Missouri, and Salt Lake City, Utah properties. 
              (4) 
    Purchase obligations consist of tenant and capital improvements at   nine   of our properties. These items were recognized on our balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  .

Funds from Operations 
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, developed FFO as a relevant non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity REIT, to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the same basis determined under GAAP. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
  FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of FFO, using the NAREIT definition, to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 
  FFO available to common stockholders is FFO adjusted to subtract distributions made to holders of preferred stock and senior common stock. We believe that net income available to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO available to common stockholders. 
  Basic funds from operations per share, or Basic FFO per share, and diluted funds from operations per share, or Diluted FFO per share, is FFO available to common stockholders divided by the number of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding and FFO available to common stockholders divided by the number of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on a diluted basis, respectively, during a period. We believe that FFO available to common stockholders, Basic FFO per share and Diluted FFO per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results in the same manner that investors use net income and earnings per share, or EPS, in evaluating net income available to common stockholders. In addition, because most REITs provide FFO available to common stockholders, Basic FFO and Diluted FFO per share information to the investment community, we believe these are useful supplemental measures when comparing us to other REITs. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO, Basic EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Basic FFO per share, and that Diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share.

The following table provides a reconciliation of our FFO available to common stockholders for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income available to common stockholders, and a computation of basic and diluted FFO per weighted average share of common stock: 

(1) 
    Diluted FFO available to common stockholders was not previously adjusted for the income impact of the assumed conversion of senior common stock, in accordance with ASC 260 ( Earnings per Share ). This adjustment has increased Diluted FFO available to common stockholders for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   by $0.01 per share and $0.03 per share, respectively.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The primary risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk. Certain of our leases contain escalations based on market indices, and the interest rate on our Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility is variable. Although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate, as applicable, these features do not eliminate this risk. To that end, we have entered into derivative contracts to cap interest rates for our variable rate notes payable. For details regarding our rate cap agreements see Note 7   Mortgage Notes Payable and Line of Credit of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  To illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we have performed the following analysis, which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and that no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. 
  The following table summarizes the annual impact of a 1%, 2% and 3% increase in the one month LIBOR as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our effective average LIBOR was   0.53%  ; thus, a 1%, 2% or 3% decrease could not occur (dollars in thousands). 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our mortgage debt outstanding was   $454.6 million  . Interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our debt instruments. If interest rates on our debt instruments, using rates at   September 30, 2016  , had been one percentage point higher or lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by $18.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively. 
  The amount outstanding under the Line of Credit and Term Loan Facility approximates fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , as the debt is variable rate. 
  In the future, we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes, primarily as a result of our Line of Credit, Term Loan Facility or long-term mortgage debt, which we use to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
  In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees and borrowers, all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt, if necessary.

    Controls and Procedures. 

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of necessarily achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Statements re: computation of ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred 
  distributions 
  (Dollars in Thousands)    

(1) 
    We recognized a $14.2 million impairment loss and a $5.3 million gain on debt extinguishment as a result of our Roseville, MN deed-in-lieu transaction during the year ended December 31, 2014. 
              (2) 
    Interest expense includes dividends paid on our mandatorily redeemable term preferred stock. 
              (3) 
    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , earnings, as defined, were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred and common distributions by $  8,435  . 
              (4) 
    For the year ended December 31,   2015  , earnings, as defined, were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred and common distributions by $  1,505  . 
              (5) 
    For the year ended December 31,   2014  , earnings, as defined, were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred and common distributions by $  10,538  . 
              (6) 
    For the year ended December 31,   2013  , earnings, as defined, were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred and common distributions by $  2,867  . 
              (7) 
    For the year ended December 31,   2012  , earnings, as defined, were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred and common distributions by $  445  . 
     N/A: Not Applicable 
  The calculation of the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions is above.  Earnings  consist of net income from continuing operations and before fixed charges.  Fixed charges  consist of interest expense, amortization of deferred financing fees and the portion of operating lease expense that represents interest. The portion of operating lease expense that represents interest is calculated by dividing the amount of rent expense allocated to us by our Administrator as part of the administration fee payable under the Administration Agreement, by three, for the years ended   December 31, 2011   to   2015   and for the   nine months ended   months ended   September 30, 2016  .
