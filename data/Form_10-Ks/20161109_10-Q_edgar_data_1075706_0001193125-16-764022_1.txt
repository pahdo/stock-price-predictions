 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 As of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  
 (Unaudited)      

Note 1.  
  Basis of Presentation       These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). However, these interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. The interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments and reclassifications, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and
financial condition as of and for the interim periods presented. All adjustments and reclassifications are of a normal and recurring nature. Results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for any other interim period or for the year as a whole.   The interim consolidated financial statements of Citizens Holding Company include
the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia (the  Bank  and collectively with Citizens Holding Company, the  Corporation ). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.    For further information and significant accounting policies of the Corporation, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of
Citizens Holding Company included in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016. 

Note 2.  
  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities       In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into
commitments to extend credit to its customers. The unused portion of these commitments is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had entered into loan commitments with certain
customers with an aggregate unused balance of $39,951,717 compared to an aggregate unused balance of $44,358,972 at December 31, 2015. There were $3,358,480 of letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2016 and $2,860,480 at December 31,
2015. The fair value of such commitments is not considered material because letters of credit and loan commitments often are not used in their entirety, if at all, before they expire. The balances of such letters and commitments should not
be used to project actual future liquidity requirements. However, the Corporation does incorporate expectations about the utilization under its credit-related commitments and into its asset and liability management program.  
 The Corporation is a party to lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, all of which are being vigorously contested. In
the regular course of business, management evaluates estimated losses or costs related to litigation, and provisions are made for anticipated losses whenever management believes that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At
the present time, management believes, based on the advice of legal counsel, that the final resolution of pending legal proceedings will not likely have a material impact on the Corporation s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

  Net Income per Share       Net income per share - basic has been computed based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during each period. Net income per share - diluted has been computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options using the
treasury stock method. Net income per share was computed as follows:      

Note 4.  
  Equity Compensation Plans       The Corporation has adopted the 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (the
 2013 Plan ), which the Corporation intends to use for all future equity grants to employees, directors or consultants until the termination or expiration of the 2013 Plan. 
 Prior to the adoption of the 2013 Plan, the Corporation utilized two stock-based compensation plans, the 1999 Directors  Stock Compensation Plan (the
 Directors  Plan ) for directors, and the 1999 Employees  Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Employees  Plan ) for employees, both of which have expired. 
      6  

Table of Contents  

  The following table is a summary of the stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
   The intrinsic value of options previously granted under the Directors  Plan at September 30, 2016, was $203,175, the
intrinsic value of options previously granted under the Employees  Plan at September 30, 2016, was $0, and since there were no options granted under the 2013 Plan during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the current intrinsic
value for the 2013 Plan at September 30, 2016 is $0, for an aggregate intrinsic value at September 30, 2016, of $203,175.   During the quarter ended June
30, 2016, the Corporation s directors received restricted stock grants totaling 7,500 shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan. These grants vest over a one-year period ending April 27, 2017 during which time the recipients have rights
to vote the shares and to receive dividends. The grant date fair value of these shares was $161,325 and will be recognized over the one-year vesting period at a cost of $13,444 per month less deferred taxes of $5,016 per month. Also during
the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there were 1,500 shares of restricted stock that vested pursuant to an incentive plan for senior management.     

Note 5.  
  Income Taxes       The income tax topic of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) defines
the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the taxing authority. This topic also provides guidance on the de-recognition, measurement and
classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties, and includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had no
unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state income tax matters. Therefore, the Corporation does not anticipate any material increase or decrease in the effective tax rate during 2016 relative to any tax positions taken. It is the
Corporation s policy to recognize interest or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.    The Corporation files a consolidated
United States federal income tax return. The Corporation is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for all tax years after 2013. The Corporation s consolidated state income tax returns
are also open to audit under the statute of limitations for the same period.

Note 6.  
  Securities       The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale and the
corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:      
     
   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 all of the securities that were classified as held-to-maturity were called or
matured and the Corporation does not intend to purchase other securities to be classified as held-to-maturity at this time. This decision to not invest in securities classified held-to-maturity is the main reason for the increase in
available-for-sale securities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.    In conjunction with the call and maturity of all held-to-maturity
securities, the remaining associated balance of unrealized losses in other comprehensive income was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016.  
      8

  At December 31, 2015, the amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities held-to-maturity and the
corresponding amounts of gross unrecognized gains and losses were as follows:      
   The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

  The tables below show the Corporation s gross unrealized losses and fair value of available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity investments, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual investments were in a continuous loss position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
 A summary of unrealized loss information for securities available-for-sale, categorized by security type follows (in thousands):  

The Corporation s unrealized losses on its obligations of United States government agencies, mortgage backed securities
and state, county and municipal bonds are the result of an upward trend in interest rates, mainly in the mid-term sector. None of the unrealized losses disclosed in the previous table are related to credit deterioration. The Corporation
has determined that none of the securities in this classification were other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 nor at December 31, 2015.

Note 7.  
  Loans       The composition of net loans (in thousands) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as
follows:      
   Loans are considered to be past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such
payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status, when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be
placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether such loans are considered past due. When interest accruals are discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash
payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Table of Contents  

  An aging analysis of past due loans (in thousands), segregated by class, as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:
     
   Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Corporation will be unable to
collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. In determining which loans to evaluate for impairment, management looks at all loans over $100,000
that are past due loans, bankruptcy filings and any situation that might lend itself to cause a borrower to be unable to repay the loan according to the original agreement terms. If a loan is determined to be impaired and the collateral is deemed to
be insufficient to fully repay the loan, a specific reserve will be established. Interest payments on impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless collectability of the principal amount is reasonably assured, in which case interest
is recognized on a cash basis. Impaired loans or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible.  
      14  

Table of Contents  

  Impaired loans (in thousands) as of September 30, 2016, segregated by class, were as follows:  
   
   During the first quarter of 2016, management and the Board of Directors reviewed the impaired loan listing according to the
Corporation s policy of reviewing individual loans for impairment over $100,000. During this review, 97 loans under that threshold in the amount of $2,731,121 and 6 loans in the amount of $1,651,023 that were over the threshold but
were determined to not be impaired at March 31, 2016, were removed from the impaired loan listing. Management believes this more accurately reflects the amount of impaired loans evaluated for impairment as part of the computation of the
allowance for loan losses.

by class:      
     
   Changes in the Corporation s troubled debt restructurings (in thousands, except for number of loans) are set forth in the
table below:      
   The allocated allowance for loan losses attributable to restructured loans was $174,274 at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The Corporation had no remaining availability under commitments to lend additional funds on these troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016.  
      17  

Table of Contents  

  The Corporation utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans when originated and is
updated as factors related to the strength of the loan changes. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 9. A description of the general characteristics of the 9 risk grades follows.  
 Grade 1. MINIMAL RISK - These loans are without loss exposure to the Corporation. This classification is reserved for only the best, well secured
loans to borrowers with significant capital strength, low leverage, stable earnings and growth and other readily available financing alternatives. This type of loan would also include loans secured by a program of the government.  
 Grade 2. MODEST RISK - These loans include borrowers with solid credit quality and moderate risk of loss. These loans may be fully secured by
certificates of deposit with another reputable financial institution, or secured by readily marketable securities with acceptable margins.    Grade
3. AVERAGE RISK - This is the rating assigned to the majority of the loans held by the Corporation. This includes loans with average loss exposure and average overall quality. These loans should liquidate through possessing adequate
collateral and adequate earnings of the borrower. In addition, these loans are properly documented and are in accordance with all aspects of the current loan policy.  
 Grade 4. ACCEPTABLE RISK - Borrower generates sufficient cash flow to fund debt service but most working asset and capital expansion needs are provided
from external sources. Profitability and key balance sheet ratios are usually close to peers but one or more may be higher than peers.    Grade
5. MANAGEMENT ATTENTION - Borrower has significant weaknesses resulting from performance trends or management concerns. The financial condition of the borrower has taken a negative turn and may be temporarily strained. Cash flow is
weak but cash reserves remain adequate to meet debt service. Management weakness is evident.    Grade 6. OTHER LOANS ESPECIALLY MENTIONED
( OLEM ) - Loans in this category are fundamentally sound but possess some weaknesses. OLEM loans have potential weaknesses which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit
position at some future date. These loans have an identifiable weakness in credit, collateral, or repayment ability but there is no expectation of loss.  
 Grade 7. SUBSTANDARD ASSETS - Assets classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or
of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard must have a well-defined weakness based upon objective evidence. Assets classified as substandard are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured
institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The possibility that liquidation would not be timely requires a substandard classification even if there is little likelihood of total loss.  
      18  

Table of Contents  

  Grade 8. DOUBTFUL - A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses of a substandard classification and
the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of
certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. A doubtful
classification could reflect the fact that the primary source of repayment is gone and serious doubt exists as to the quality of a secondary source of repayment.  
 Grade 9. LOSS - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not
warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may occur in the
future. Also included in this classification is the defined loss portion of loans rated substandard assets and doubtful assets.   These internally
assigned grades are updated on a continual basis throughout the course of the year and represent management s most updated judgment regarding grades at September 30, 2016.  
 The following table details the amount of gross loans (in thousands), segregated by loan grade and class, as of September 30, 2016:

  The following table details the amount of gross loans (in thousands) segregated by loan grade and class, as of
December 31, 2015:      
   The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which
represents management s best estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. 
 The allowance on the majority of the loan portfolio is calculated using a historical chargeoff percentage applied to the current loan balances by loan
segment. This historical period is the average of the previous twenty quarters with the most current quarters weighted more heavily to show the effect of the most recent chargeoff activity. This percentage is also adjusted for economic
factors such as local unemployment and general business conditions, both local and nationwide.    The group of loans that are considered to be impaired are
individually evaluated for possible loss and a specific reserve is established to cover any loss contingency. Loans that are determined to be a loss with no benefit of remaining in the portfolio are charged off to the allowance. These
specific reserves are reviewed periodically for continued impairment and adequacy of the specific reserve and are adjusted when necessary.

Note 8.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The fair value topic of the ASC establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. This topic clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. This topic also requires disclosure about how fair value was determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on
significant levels of inputs as follows:       

Level 1 
    
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level 2 
    
 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or  

Level 3 
    
 Unobservable inputs for an asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.  
 
  The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.   The following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016:

  The financial instruments topic of the ASC requires disclosure of financial instruments  fair values, as
well as the methodology and significant assumptions used in estimating fair values. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many
cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The financial instruments topic of the ASC excludes certain financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not represent the underlying value of the Corporation and may not be indicative of amounts that might ultimately be realized upon disposition or settlement of those assets and liabilities.  
 The following represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Corporation s financial instruments at September 30, 2016:

instruments at December 31, 2015:      
   The fair value estimates, methods and assumptions used by the Corporation in estimating its fair value disclosures for
financial statements were as follows:     Cash and Due from Banks and Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks   
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair value because of their immediate and shorter-term maturities, which
are considered to be three months or less when purchased.     Securities Held-to-Maturity   
 Securities held-to-maturity consist of debt securities such as obligations of states and other political subdivisions. Where quoted market prices in active
markets are available, securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted prices from active markets are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets,
quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of
the fair value hierarchy. When assumptions used in model-based valuation techniques are not observable in the market, the assumptions used by management reflect estimates of assumptions used by other market participants in determining fair value.
When there is limited transparency around the inputs to the valuation, the instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

   Securities Available-for-Sale   
 Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments (Level 2). When neither quoted prices nor comparable instruments are available, unobservable inputs are needed to form an expected future cash flow analysis to establish fair values (Level 3).
   The Corporation owns certain beneficial interests in one collateralized debt obligation secured by community bank trust preferred securities. These
interests do not trade in a liquid market, and therefore, market quotes are not a reliable indicator of their ultimate realizability. The Corporation utilizes a discounted cash flow model using inputs of (1) market yields of trust-preferred
securities as the discount rate and (2) expected cash flows which are estimated using assumptions related to defaults, deferrals and prepayments to determine the fair values of these beneficial interests. Many of the factors that adjust the timing
and extent of cash flows are based on judgment and not directly observable in the markets. Therefore, these fair values are classified as Level 3 valuations for accounting and disclosure purposes. Since observable transactions in these securities
are extremely rare, the Corporation uses assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing these instruments. These assumptions primarily include cash flow estimates and market discount rates. The cash flow estimates are sensitive to the
assumptions related to the ability of the issuers to pay the underlying trust preferred securities according to their terms. The market discount rates depend on transactions, which are rare given the lack of interest of investors in these types of
beneficial interests.     Net Loans     For variable-rate
loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for other loans, including impaired loans, (i.e., commercial real estate and rental property mortgage loans,
commercial and industrial loans, financial institution loans, and agricultural loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality.    Deposits     The fair values for demand
deposits, NOW and money market accounts and savings accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts for variable-rate, fixed-term money market
accounts and time deposits approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates
to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.    Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) Borrowings   
 The fair value of FHLB advances is based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

   Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase   
 Due to the short term nature of these instruments, which is generally three months or less, the carrying amount is equal to the fair value.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Instruments     The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. The fees associated with these financial instruments are not material.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation -
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 is intended to reduce complexity in accounting standards by simplifying several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flow; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of
employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes. The amendments of ASU 2016-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is currently
evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). The update will
significantly change the way entities recognize impairment on many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the asset s remaining life. The FASB describes this impairment recognition
model as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model and believes the CECL model will result in more timely recognition of credit losses since the CECL model incorporates expected credit losses versus incurred credit losses. The scope
of FASB s CECL model would include loans, held-to-maturity debt instruments, lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not accounted for at fair value. For public companies, this update becomes effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will continue to monitor FASB s progress on this topic.

  Management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater insight into the results of operations
and the financial condition of Citizens Holding Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia (the  Bank,  and collectively with Citizens Holding Company, the  Corporation ). The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.    OVERVIEW  
 The Company is a one-bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on February 16, 1982. The Company is the sole shareholder of
The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia ( Bank ). The Company does not have any subsidiaries other than the Bank.    The Bank was opened on
February 8, 1908 as The First National Bank of Philadelphia. In 1917, the Bank surrendered its national charter and obtained a state charter, at which time the name of the Bank was changed to The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia, Mississippi. At
September, 2016, the Bank was the largest bank headquartered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, with total assets of $1.025 billion and total deposits of $780.5 million  
 The principal executive offices of both the Company and the Bank are located at 521 Main Street, Philadelphia, Mississippi 39350, and the main telephone
number is (601) 656-4692. All references hereinafter to the activities or operations of the Company reflect the Company s activities or operations through the Bank.  
 LIQUIDITY    The Corporation has an asset and liability management
program that assists management in maintaining net interest margins during times of both rising and falling interest rates and in maintaining sufficient liquidity. A measurement of liquidity is the ratio of net deposits and short-term
liabilities divided by the sum of net cash, short-term investments and marketable assets. This measurement for liquidity of the Corporation at September 30, 2016, was 40.40% and at December 31, 2015, was 32.73%. The increase was due to an
increase in short term marketable assets at September 30, 2016. Management believes it maintains adequate liquidity for the Corporation s current needs.  
 The Corporation s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits, which were $780,463,454 at September 30, 2016, and $753,404,788 at December 31,
2015. Other sources of liquidity include investment securities, the Corporation s line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) and federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Corporation had $456,651,317
invested in available-for-sale investment securities at September 30, 2016, and $267,264,403 at December 31, 2015. This increase is due to the Corporation investing matured or called funds in the held-to-maturity classification to the
available-for-sale classification. The Corporation also had $79,169,722 in interest bearing deposits at other banks at September 30, 2016 and $42,267,777 at December 31, 2015. The increase in interest bearing deposits was the result of long
term investments being called or matured. The Corporation had secured and unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks in the amount of $45,000,000 at both  
      31  

Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition, the Corporation has the ability to draw on its line of credit with the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had unused and
available $99,873,547 of its line of credit with the FHLB and at December 31, 2015, the Corporation had unused and available $146,840,812 of its line of credit with the FHLB. The decrease in the amount available under the Corporation s
line of credit with the FHLB from the end of 2015 to September 30, 2016, was the result of a decrease in the amount of loans eligible for the collateral pool securing the Corporation s line of credit with the FHLB. The Corporation had no
federal funds purchased as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks on a temporary basis to meet short term funding needs.  
 When the Corporation has more funds than it needs for its reserve requirements or short-term liquidity needs, the Corporation increases its investment
portfolio, increases the balances in interest bearing due from bank accounts or sells federal funds. It is management s policy to maintain an adequate portion of its portfolio of assets and liabilities on a short-term basis to insure rate
flexibility and to meet loan funding and liquidity needs. When deposits decline or do not grow sufficiently to fund loan demand, management will seek funding either through federal funds purchased or advances from the FHLB.  
 CAPITAL RESOURCES    Total shareholders  equity was
$97,071,374 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $86,425,336 at December 31, 2015. The increase in shareholders  equity was the result of a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss brought about by the investment securities
market value adjustment as well as the increase in the amount of earnings in excess of dividends paid. The market value adjustment, which was an increase was due to general market conditions, specifically the decrease in medium term interest rates,
which caused an increase in the market price of the Corporation s investment portfolio.    The Corporation paid aggregate cash dividends in the amount
of $3,514,296, or $0.72 per share, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.69 per share for the same period in 2015.  
 Quantitative measures established by federal regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total
and Tier 1 capital (primarily common stock and retained earnings, less goodwill) to risk weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that as of September 30, 2016, the Corporation meets all capital adequacy
requirements to which it is subject and according to these requirements the Corporation is considered to be well capitalized.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
( OCC ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) to adopt regulations imposing a continuing  floor  on the risk based capital requirements. In December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework
for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as  Basel III . In early July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules relevant to us: (1) the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; and (2) the
 standardized approach of Basel II for non-core banks and bank holding companies , such as the Bank and the Corporation. The capital framework under Basel III will replace the existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings
associations and U.S. bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in total assets, and all savings and loan holding companies.    Beginning
January 1, 2015, the Corporation and the Bank were required to comply with the final Basel III rules, although the rules will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2019. Among other things, the final Basel III rules will impact regulatory capital
ratios of banking organizations in the following manner, when fully phased-in:      

Create a new requirement to maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of not less than 4.5%;        

Increase the minimum leverage capital ratio to 4% for all banking organizations (currently 3% for certain banking organizations);        

Increase the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4% to 6%; and        

Maintain the minimum total risk-based capital ratio at 8%.      In addition, the final Basel III rules, when fully
phased-in, will subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization did not maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital
in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets. The effect of the capital conservation buffer, when fully phased-in, will be to increase the minimum common  
      33  

Table of Contents  

equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7%, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5% and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5% for banking organizations seeking to avoid the
limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.    The final Basel III rules also changed the capital
categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of prompt corrective action. Under the final rules, to be well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a leverage capital ratio of at least 5%. In addition, the final Basel III rules established more conservative standards for including an
instrument in regulatory capital and imposed certain deductions from and adjustments to the measure of common equity Tier 1 capital.    Management believes
that, as of September 30, 2016, the Corporation and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III and the banking agencies  proposals on a fully phased-in basis, if such requirements were currently effective. The changes
to the calculation of risk-weighted assets required by Basel III did not have a material impact on the Corporation s capital ratios as presented. Management will continue to monitor these and any future proposals submitted by the
Corporation s and Bank s regulators.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain items in the consolidated statements of income of the Corporation and the related changes
between those periods:      
   See Note 3 to the Corporation s Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation regarding the Corporation s
calculation of Net Income Per Share - basic and - diluted.    Annualized return on average equity ( ROE ) was 7.64% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, and 8.78% for the corresponding period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, ROE was 7.40% compared to 8.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In both instances, the decrease in ROE was caused by the
increase in equity balances for both periods.    Book value per share increased to $19.88 at September 30, 2016, compared to $17.73 at December 31, 2015.
The increase in book value per share reflects the amount of earnings in excess of dividends and a decrease in other comprehensive loss due to the increase in fair value of the Corporation s investment securities. Average assets for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $992,221,236 compared to $945,269,885 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due mainly to an increase in available-for-sale securities offset by a decrease in held-to-maturity
securities.

  NET INTEREST INCOME / NET INTEREST MARGIN  
 One component of the Corporation s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments
and the interest paid for deposits and borrowed funds. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.  
 The annualized net interest margin was 3.10% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.34% for the corresponding period of 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, annualized net interest margin was 3.11% compared to 3.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin for both periods ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same
periods in 2015, was the result of the decrease in yields on earning assets exceeding the decrease in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, as detailed below. Earning assets averaged $923,004,291 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
This represents an increase of $58,458,503, or 6.8%, over average earning assets of $864,545,788 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Earning assets averaged $913,503,971 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This represents an
increase of $61,016,940, or 7.2%, over average earning assets of $852,487,031 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in average earning assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, is the result of an increase
in investment securities.    Interest bearing deposits averaged $621,412,181 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This represents an increase of
$31,901,186, or 5.4%, from the average of interest bearing deposits of $589,510,995 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was due, in large part, to an increase in interest-bearing NOW, money market accounts and savings accounts
partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit.    Other borrowed funds averaged $123,728,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This
represents an increase of $4,528,796, or 3.8%, over the other borrowed funds of $119,199,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in other borrowed funds was due to a $4,603,514 increase in the securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, a $14,935 decrease in the Agribusiness Enterprise Loan Liability and a $59,783 decrease in Federal Funds Purchased for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015.    Interest bearing deposits averaged $622,267,850 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This represents an increase of $45,328,422, or 7.9%,
from the average of interest bearing deposits of $576,939,428 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was due, in large part, to an increase in interest-bearing NOW, money market accounts and savings accounts, partially offset by a
decrease in certificates of deposit.    Other borrowed funds averaged $123,768,381 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This represents an increase
of $675,112, or 0.5%, over the other borrowed funds of $123,093,269 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in other borrowed  
      36

funds was due to a $706,942 increase in the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, a $14,383 decrease in the Agribusiness Enterprise Loan Liability and a $17,447 decrease in Federal
Funds Purchased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    Net interest income was
$6,820,139 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $202,697 from $7,022,836 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by an increase in earning assets. The
changes in volume in earning assets and in deposits and in borrowed funds are discussed above. As for changes in interest rates in the three months ended September 30, 2016, the yields on earning assets decreased more than the rates paid on
deposits and borrowed funds decreased from the same period in 2015. The yield on all interest bearing assets decreased 26 basis points to 3.43% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.69% for the same period in 2015. At the
same time, the rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 dropped 3 basis points to 0.40% from 0.43% in the same period in 2015. As longer term interest bearing assets and liabilities mature and
reprice, management believes that the yields on interest bearing assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities will both increase.   Net interest income
was $20,501,070 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $437,298 from $20,938,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by an increase in earning
assets. The changes in volume in earning assets and in deposits and in borrowed funds are discussed above. As for changes in interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the yields on earning assets decreased more than the
rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds decreased from the same period in 2015. The yield on all interest bearing assets decreased 29 basis points to 3.44% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.73% for the same period in
2015. At the same time, the rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 dropped 3 basis points to 0.40% from 0.43% in the same period in 2015. As longer term interest bearing assets and
liabilities mature and reprice, management believes that the yields on interest bearing assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities will both increase. 
 The following table shows the interest and fees and corresponding yields for loans only.  
   
   The decrease in interest rates in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects the decrease in all loan
interest rates for both new and refinanced loans in the period.

  CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE  
 As a natural corollary to the Corporation s lending activities, some loan losses are to be expected. The risk of loss varies with the type of loan being
made and the overall creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan. The degree of perceived risk is taken into account in establishing the structure of, and interest rates and security for, specific loans and for various types of
loans. The Corporation attempts to minimize its credit risk exposure by use of thorough loan application and approval procedures.    The Corporation
maintains a program of systematic review of its existing loans. Loans are graded for their overall quality. Those loans, which management determines require further monitoring and supervision, are segregated and reviewed on a regular
basis. Significant problem loans are reviewed monthly by the Corporation s management and Board of Directors.    The Corporation charges off that
portion of any loan that the Corporation s management and Board of Directors has determined to be a loss. A loan is generally considered by management to represent a loss, in whole or in part, when exposure beyond the collateral value is
apparent, servicing of the unsecured portion has been discontinued or collection is not anticipated based on the borrower s financial condition. The general economic conditions in the borrower s industry influence this determination. The
principal amount of any loan that is declared a loss is charged against the Corporation s allowance for loan losses.    The Corporation s
allowance for loan losses is designed to provide for loan losses that can be reasonably anticipated. The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to operating expenses in the form of provisions for loan losses. Actual loan
losses or recoveries are charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Board of Directors determines the amount of the allowance. Among the factors considered in determining the allowance for loan losses are the current financial
condition of the Corporation s borrowers and the value of security, if any, for their loans. Estimates of future economic conditions and their impact on various industries and individual borrowers are also taken into consideration, as are the
Corporation s historical loan loss experience and reports of banking regulatory authorities. As these estimates, factors and evaluations are primarily judgmental, no assurance can be given as to whether the Corporation will sustain loan
losses in excess or below its allowance or that subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio may not require material increases or decreases in such allowance.

  The following table summarizes the Corporation s allowance for loan losses for the dates indicated:  
   
   The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $184,018, an increase of $42,314 from the
$141,704 provision for the same period in 2015. The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $97,468, a decrease of $310,230 from the $407,698 provision for the same period in 2015. The change in the
Corporation s loan loss provisions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is a result of management s assessment of inherent loss in the loan portfolio, including the impact caused by current local, national and
international economic conditions. The Corporation s model used to calculate the provision is based on the percentage of historical charge-offs applied to the current loan balances by loan segment and specific reserves applied to certain
impaired loans. Nonaccrual loans decreased during this period due to the amount of payments received and loans charged off in excess of new loans being added to the nonaccrual loan list.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net loan losses charged to the allowance for loan losses totaled $879,571, an increase of $873,735 from the
$5,836 charged off in the same period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to a charge off on single loan in the amount of $815,907 on commercial real estate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net loan losses charged to the allowance for
loan losses totaled $2,457,729, an increase of $2,336,487 from the $121,242 charged off in the same period in 2015. The net loan losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 contained $2,339,308 in losses on two long-term commercial
real estate loan for which the Corporation had previously provided a specific reserve against this loss through the provision for loan loss.    Management
reviews quarterly with the Corporation s Board of Directors the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The loan loss provision is adjusted when specific items reflect a need for such an adjustment. Management believes that there were
no material loan losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have not been charged off. Management also believes that the Corporation s allowance will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the Corporation s loan
portfolio. However, it remains possible that additional provisions for loan loss may be required.

  OTHER INCOME  
 Other income includes service charges on deposit accounts, wire transfer fees, safe deposit box rentals and other revenue not derived from interest on earning
assets. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,079,658, an increase of $62,045, or 3.1%, from $2,017,613 the same period in 2015. Service charges on deposit accounts were $1,009,486 in the three months ended

  BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS      

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  
 Cash and cash equivalents, which consist of cash, balances at correspondent banks and items in process of collection, balance at September 30, 2016 was
$22,727,843, which was an increase of $7,780,153 from the balance of $14,947,690 at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to an increase in the balances at correspondent banks due to an increase in the amount of checks drawn on other banks in
the normal process of clearing funds between these banks.    INVESTMENT SECURITIES  
 The Corporation s investment securities portfolio primarily consists of United States agency debentures, mortgage-backed securities and obligations of
states, counties and municipalities. The Corporation s investments securities portfolio at September 30, 2016, increased by $28,343,510, or 6.6%, to $456,651,317 from $428,307,807 at December 31, 2015. This increase was due to
additional purchases of mortgage backed securities, agency and state county and municipal securities, which was partially funded by increases in deposits, a decrease in loan balances and by changes in the market value of the Corporation s
investment securities portfolio.    LOANS    The
Corporation s loan balance decreased by $17,203,199 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $405,905,192 from $423,108,391 at December 31, 2015. Loan demand weakened, especially in business loan and consumer loan categories,
and competition for available loans continued to be strong during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No material changes were made to the loan products offered by the Corporation during this period.

  PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation s premises and equipment decreased by $398,776, or 2.1%, to $18,256,915 from $18,655,691
at December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to depreciation expense exceeding the amount of property and equipment added for the period. 
 DEPOSITS    The following table shows the balance
and percentage change in the various deposits:    DEPOSITS      
   Interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits and savings increased while certificates of deposit decreased during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Management continually monitors the interest rates on loan and deposit products to ensure that the Corporation is in line with the rates dictated by the market and our asset and liability management
objectives. These rate adjustments impact deposit balances.    OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
 Please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the nature and extent of the
Corporation s off-balance sheet arrangements, which consist solely of commitments to fund loans and letters of credit.    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
 There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of the Corporation s business to the contractual obligations set forth in Note 12 to
the Corporation s financial statements contained in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      The following discussion of operations outlines
specific risks that could affect the Corporation s ability to compete, change the Corporation s risk profile or eventually impact the Corporation s financial condition or results. The risks the Corporation faces generally are similar
to those experienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies.    The Corporation s strategies and its management s ability to
react to changing competitive and economic environments have historically enabled the Corporation to compete effectively and manage risks to acceptable levels. The Corporation has outlined potential risks below that it presently believes could be
important; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and the Corporation cannot predict with certainty all potential developments that could affect the Corporation s financial condition or
results of operation. The following discussion highlights potential risks, which could intensify over time or shift dynamically in a way that might change the Corporation s risk profile.  
  Competition Risks     The market in which the Corporation
competes is saturated with community banks seeking to provide a service-oriented banking experience to individuals and businesses compared with what the Corporation believes is the more rigid and less friendly environment found in larger banks. This
requires the Corporation to offer most, if not all, of the products and conveniences that are offered by the larger banks, but with a service differentiation. In doing so, it is imperative that the Corporation identify the lines of business that the
Corporation can excel in, prudently utilize the Corporation s available capital to acquire the people and platforms required thereof, and execute on these strategies.  
  Credit Risks     Like all lenders, the Corporation faces the
risk that the Corporation s customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss of principal. In the Corporation s business, some level of credit loss is unavoidable and
overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. The Corporation s ability to manage credit risk depends primarily upon the Corporation s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including real
estate. The Corporation controls credit risk by diversifying the Corporation s loan portfolio and managing its composition, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses in accordance with applicable accounting
rules. At the end of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had approximately $4.1 million of available reserves to cover such losses. The models and approaches the Corporation uses to originate and manage loans are regularly reviewed, if
necessary or advisable, updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on the Corporation s experience originating loans and
servicing loan portfolios.

   Financing, Funding and Liquidity Risks   
 One of the most important aspects of management s efforts to sustain long-term profitability for the Corporation is the management of interest rate
risk. Management s goal is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest-rate risk and liquidity.    The Corporation s
assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature and the resulting earnings thereon are subject to significant variability due to the timing and extent to which the Corporation can reprice the yields on interest-earning assets and the
costs of interest bearing liabilities as a result of changes in market interest rates. Interest rates in the financial markets affect the Corporation s decisions on pricing its assets and liabilities, which impacts net interest income, an
important cash flow stream for the Corporation. As a result, a substantial part of the Corporation s risk-management activities are devoted to managing interest-rate risk. Currently, the Corporation does not have any significant risks
related to foreign currency exchange, commodities or equity risk exposures.     Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks   
 A significant portion of the Corporation s business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact the
Corporation s revenues and expenses, and potentially could compress the Corporation s net interest margin. The Corporation actively manages its balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by
ordinary fluctuations in rates.    Like all financial services companies, the Corporation faces the risk of abnormalities in the yield curve. The yield
curve shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates, it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates, and it is inverted
when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve has been positively sloped. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, as funding costs increase relative to the yield on
assets. Currently, the yield curve is positively sloped.     Regulatory and Legal Risks   
 The Corporation operates in a heavily regulated industry and therefore is subject to many banking, deposit, and consumer lending laws as well as the rules and
regulations promulgated by the FDIC, FRB, Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ stock market. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial or operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with
applicable regulations may increase the Corporation s costs and/or limit the Corporation s ability to pursue certain business opportunities. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which the
Corporation, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, the Corporation is subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how the Corporation conducts business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual
property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities occasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could limit the amount of interest or fees the Corporation can charge, could restrict the
Corporation s ability to collect loans or realize on collateral or could materially affect us in other  
      45  

Table of Contents  

ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations could also expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting the
Corporation s ability to share or receive customer information and increasing the Corporation s costs. In addition, changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how the Corporation records and reports assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and earnings.    The Corporation also faces litigation risks from customers (individually or in class actions) and from federal or state
regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, and the Corporation manages those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, the Corporation s compliance and ethics processes and
other means. However, the commencement, outcome and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty.     Accounting Estimate
Risks     The preparation of the Corporation s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant
estimates that affect the financial statements. The Corporation s most critical estimate is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as
litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future,
the Corporation may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or the Corporation may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the
estimates that the Corporation previously made.     Expense Control   
 Expenses and other costs directly affect the Corporation s earnings. The Corporation s ability to successfully manage expenses is important to
its long-term profitability. Many factors can influence the amount of the Corporation s expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As the Corporation s businesses change or expand, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases,
structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. The Corporation manages expense growth and risk through a variety of means, including actual versus budget management, imposition of expense
authorization, and procurement coordination and processes.

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.      The management of the Corporation, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s
management as appropriate to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report).    There were no changes to the Corporation s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.

    PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.      The Corporation is a party to lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course
of business, all of which are being vigorously contested. In the regular course of business, management evaluates estimated losses or costs related to litigation, and provisions are made for anticipated losses whenever management believes that such
losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, management believes, based on the advice of legal counsel, that the final resolution of pending legal proceedings will not likely have a material impact on the
Corporation s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.      

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS.      The Corporation s business, future   financial condition and results of operations are
subject to a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, which are disclosed in Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which the Corporation filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016. Additional information regarding some of those risks and uncertainties is contained in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, in
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  appearing in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report and in  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  appearing in
Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report. The risks and uncertainties disclosed in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporation s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed
with the SEC are not necessarily all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Corporation s business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Corporation s year
ended December 31, 2015.
