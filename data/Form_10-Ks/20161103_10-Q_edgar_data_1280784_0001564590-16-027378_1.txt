NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
 (unaudited)  
   
 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation  
   
 Hercules Capital, Inc. (the  Company ) is a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high-growth, innovative venture capital-backed companies in a variety of technology, life sciences, and sustainable and renewable technology industries. The Company sources its investments through its principal office located in Palo Alto, CA, as well as through its additional offices in Boston, MA, New York, NY, Washington, DC, Santa Monica, CA, Hartford, CT, and San Diego, CA. The Company was incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland in December 2003. 
   
 The Company is an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). From incorporation through December 31, 2005, the Company was taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Effective January 1, 2006, the Company elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Code (see Note 5). As an investment company, the Company follows accounting and reporting guidance as set forth in Topic 946 ( Financial Services   Investment Companies ) of the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ( ASC ).  
   
 Hercules Technology II, L.P. ( HT II ), Hercules Technology III, L.P. ( HT III ), and Hercules Technology IV, L.P. ( HT IV ), are Delaware limited partnerships that were formed in January 2005, September 2009 and December 2010, respectively. HT II and HT III were licensed to operate as small business investment companies ( SBICs ) under the authority of the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) on September 27, 2006 and May 26, 2010, respectively. As SBICs, HT II and HT III are subject to a variety of regulations concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which they may invest and the structure of those investments. HT IV was formed in anticipation of receiving an additional SBIC license; however, the Company has not yet applied for such license, and HT IV currently has no material assets or liabilities. The Company also formed Hercules Technology SBIC Management, LLC, or ( HTM ), a limited liability company in November 2003. HTM is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and serves as the limited partner and general partner of HT II and HT III (see Note 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements). 
   
 HT II and HT III hold approximately $100.4 million and $252.7 million in assets, respectively, and they accounted for approximately 5.5% and 14.0% of the Company s total assets, respectively, prior to consolidation at September 30, 2016. 
   
 The Company also established wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are structured as Delaware corporations and limited liability companies, to hold portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities). By investing through these wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company is able to benefit from the tax treatment of these entities and create a tax structure that is more advantageous with respect to the Company s RIC status. These taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by these taxable subsidiaries are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements and recorded at fair value. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with Hercules for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. 
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and its consolidated securitization VIE. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X, the Company does not consolidate portfolio company investments. It is not appropriate for an investment company to consolidate a portfolio company that is not an investment company. Rather, an investment company s interest in portfolio companies that are not investment companies should be measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 946. 
   
 The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 and 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting solely of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been included. The current period s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Therefore, the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the period ended December 31, 2015. The year-end Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  
   
 37 

Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP ba  sis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes   known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.   
   
 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Principles of Consolidation  
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and all VIEs of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 A VIE is an entity that either (i) has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or (ii) has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party with both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.  
 To assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the Company considers all the facts and circumstances including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the party that makes the most significant decisions affecting the VIE is determined to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity interests, servicing rights and fee arrangements, and any other variable interests in the VIE. If the Company determines that it is the party with the power to make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE, and the Company has a potentially significant interest in the VIE, then it consolidates the VIE.  
 The Company performs periodic reassessments, usually quarterly, of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether the Company has acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The Company also reconsiders whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore are subject to the VIE consolidation framework.  
 As of the date of this report, the only VIE consolidated by the Company is its securitization VIE formed in conjunction with the issuance of the 2021 Asset-Backed Notes (as defined herein). See  Note 4   Borrowings .  
 Reclassification 
   Certain balances from prior years have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.  
 Change in Accounting Principle 
   As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and ASU 2015-15  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which collectively require debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, except for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Adoption of these standards results in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from Other Assets and the presentation of the Company s SBA Debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and Convertible Senior Notes net of the associated debt issuance costs for each instrument in the liabilities section on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the comparative Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2015 has been adjusted to apply the change in accounting principle retrospectively. Specifically, the presentation of the Company s Other Assets, SBA Debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and Convertible Senior Notes line items were adjusted by the amount of unamortized debt issuance costs for each instrument. There is no impact to the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, there is no change to the presentation of the Wells Facility or Union Bank Facility as debt issuance costs are presented separately as an asset on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.   
   
 38 

Debt issuance costs are fees and other direct incremental costs incurred by the Company in obtaining debt financing and are recognized as prepaid expenses and amortized over the life of th  e related debt instrument using th  e effective yield method or   the straight line method, which closely approximates the effective yield method. In accordance with ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction to the associated liability balance on the Consolid  ated Statement of Assets and Liabilities, except for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, were as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

(1)   
 
 As the Wells Facility and Union Bank Facility are line-of-credit arrangements, the debt issuance costs associated with these instruments are presented separately as an asset on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities in accordance with ASU 2015-15. As the Union Bank Facility was replaced on May 5, 2016, amounts included above prior to May 5, 2016 relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility (as defined herein, see Note 4).    

 Valuation of Investments  
 The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. 
 At September 30, 2016, approximately 93.0% of the Company s total assets represented investments in portfolio companies whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. The Company s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820 ( Fair Value Measurements ). The Company s debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. As such, the Company values substantially all of its investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy by the Company s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments determined in good faith by its Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.  
 The Company may from time to time engage an independent valuation firm to provide the Company with valuation assistance with respect to certain portfolio investments. The Company engages independent valuation firms on a discretionary basis. Specifically, on a quarterly basis, the Company will identify portfolio investments with respect to which an independent valuation firm will assist in valuing. The Company selects these portfolio investments based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the potential for material fluctuations in valuation results, credit quality and the time lapse since the last valuation of the portfolio investment by an independent valuation firm. 
 The Company intends to continue to engage an independent valuation firm to provide management with assistance regarding the Company s determination of the fair value of selected portfolio investments each quarter unless directed by the Board of Directors to cancel such valuation services. The scope of services rendered by an independent valuation firm is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company s Board of Directors is ultimately, and solely, responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments in good faith.  
   
 39 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent f  air value, the Company s Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:   
 (1) the Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;  
 (2) preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and business based assumptions are discussed with the Company s investment committee;  
 (3) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuation of the investments in the portfolio as provided by the investment committee, which incorporates the results of the independent valuation firm as appropriate; and 
 (4) the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good faith based on the input of, where applicable, the respective independent valuation firm and the investment committee.  
 ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. ASC Topic 820 also requires disclosure for fair value measurements based on the level within the hierarchy of the information used in the valuation. ASC Topic 820 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
 The Company has categorized all investments recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC Topic 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:  
 Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are equities listed in active markets.  
 Level 2 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset in connection with market data at the measurement date and for the extent of the instrument s anticipated life. Fair valued assets that are generally included in this category are publically held debt investments and warrants held in a public company.  
 Level 3 Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset at the measurement date. It includes prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Generally, assets carried at fair value and included in this category are the debt investments and warrants and equities held in a private company.  
 Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015. The Company transfers investments in and out of Level 1, 2 and 3 as of the beginning balance sheet date, based on changes in the use of observable and unobservable inputs utilized to perform the valuation for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no transfers between Levels 1 or 2.

The following tables provide quantitative information about the Company   s Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, according to the Company s valuation policy the Company may also use other valuation techniques and metho  dologies when determining the Company s fair value measurements. The tables below are not intended to be all-inclusive, but rather provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to the Company s fair value measurements.   
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s escrow receivables is the amount recoverable at the contractual maturity date of the escrow receivable. 

(a)   
 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt securities are hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts). The hypothetical market yield is defined as the exit price of an investment in a hypothetical market to hypothetical market participants where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The premiums (discounts) relate to company specific characteristics such as underlying investment performance, security liens, and other characteristics of the investment. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. Debt investments in the industries noted in the Company s Consolidated Schedule of Investments are included in the industries noted above as follows:     

Pharmaceuticals, above, is comprised of debt investments in the Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Drug Discovery and Development, Drug Delivery and Biotechnology Tools industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.

Debt Investments   
   
 The Company follows the guidance set forth in ASC Topic 820 which establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. The Company s debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for debt instruments for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, invest in public debt of companies that meet the Company s investment objectives. These investments are considered Level 2 assets. 
   
 In making a good faith determination of the value of the Company s investments, the Company generally starts with the cost basis of the investment, which includes the value attributed to the original issue discount ( OID ), if any, and payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest or other receivables which have been accrued as earned. The Company then applies the valuation methods as set forth below. 
   
 The Company applies a procedure for debt investments that assumes the sale of each investment in a hypothetical market to a hypothetical market participant where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The hypothetical market does not include scenarios where the underlying security was simply repaid or extinguished, but includes an exit concept. The Company determines the yield at inception for each debt investment. The Company then uses senior secured, leveraged loan yields provided by third party providers to determine the change in market yields between inception of the debt security and the measurement date. Industry specific indices and other relevant market data are used to benchmark/assess market based movements.  
   
 Under this process, the Company also evaluates the collateral for recoverability of the debt investments. The Company considers each portfolio company s credit rating, security liens and other characteristics of the investment to adjust the baseline yield to derive a credit adjusted hypothetical yield for each investment as of the measurement date. The anticipated future cash flows from each investment are then discounted at the hypothetical yield to estimate each investment s fair value as of the measurement date. 
   
 The Company s process includes, among other things, the underlying investment performance, the current portfolio company s financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. The Company values its syndicated debt investments using broker quotes and bond indices amongst other factors. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a debt investment, the Company may consider other factors to estimate fair value, including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. 
   
 The Company records unrealized depreciation on investments when it believes that an investment has decreased in value, including where collection of a debt investment is doubtful or, if under the in-exchange premise, when the value of a debt security is less than amortized cost of the investment. Conversely, where appropriate, the Company records unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, that its investment has also appreciated in value or, if under the in-exchange premise, the value of a debt security is greater than amortized cost. 
   
 When originating a debt instrument, the Company generally receives warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower. The Company determines the cost basis of the warrants or other equity-related securities received based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants or other equity-related securities received. Any resulting discount on the debt investments from recordation of the warrant or other equity instruments is accreted into interest income over the life of the debt investment. 
 Debt investments that are traded on a public exchange are valued at the prevailing market price at period end. 
  Equity-Related Securities and Warrants   
   
 Securities that are traded in the over-the-counter markets or on a stock exchange will be valued at the prevailing bid price at period end. The Company has a limited amount of equity securities in public companies. In accordance with the 1940 Act, unrestricted publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the measurement date. 

45 

The Company estimates the fair value of warrants using a Black Scholes OPM. At each reporting date, privately held warrant and equity-related securities are valued based on an analysis of various factors including, but not limited to,   the portfolio company s operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions, price to enterprise value or price to equity ratios, discounted cash flow, valuation comparisons to comparable public companies or other industry benchmark  s. When an external event occurs, such as a purchase transaction, public offering, or subsequent equity sale, the pricing indicated by that external event is utilized to corroborate the Company s valuation of the warrant and equity-related securities. The   Company periodically reviews the valuation of its portfolio companies that have not been involved in a qualifying external event to determine if the enterprise value of the portfolio company may have increased or decreased since the last valuation measurem  ent date.  
  Escrow Receivables  
 Escrow receivables are collected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement. Escrow balances are typically distributed over a period greater than one year and may accrue interest during the escrow period. Escrow balances are measured for collectability on at least a quarterly basis and fair value is determined based on the amount of the estimated recoverable balances and the contractual maturity date. As of September 30, 2016 there were no material past due escrow receivables. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 As required by the 1940 Act, the Company classifies its investments by level of control.  Control investments  are defined in the 1940 Act as investments in those companies that the Company is deemed to  control.  Under the 1940 Act, the Company is generally deemed to  control  a company in which it has invested if it owns 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or has greater than 50% representation on its board.  Affiliate investments  are investments in those companies that are  affiliated companies  of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, which are not control investments. The Company is deemed to be an  affiliate  of a company in which it has invested if it owns 5% or more, but generally less than 25%, of the voting securities of such company.  Non-control/non-affiliate investments  are investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments.  
 The following table summarizes the Company s realized and unrealized gain and loss and changes in our unrealized appreciation and depreciation on control and affiliate investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company did not hold any control investments at September 30, 2015. 

In June 2016, the Company s investments in SkyCross, Inc. became classified as a control investment as a result of obtaining more than 50% representation on the portfolio company s board. In June 2016 the Company also acquired 100% ownership of the equity of Achilles Technology Management Co II, Inc. and classified it as a control investment in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. In June 2016, Achilles Technology Management Co II, Inc. acquired the assets of a global antenna company that produces radio frequency system solutions as part of an article 9 consensual foreclosure and public auction for total consideration in the amount of $4.0 million. In September 2016, the Company made a $1.0 million debt investment in Achilles Technology Management II to provide working capital under the terms of a loan servicing agreement. The Company s investments in Achilles Technology Management Co II, Inc. are carried on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities at fair value. 
 As of December 31, 2015, changes to the capitalization structure of the portfolio company Gelesis, Inc. reduced the Company s investment below the threshold for classification as an affiliate investment.

($8.9 million), Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ($1.5 million), Ping Identity Corporation ($1.3 million), Touchcommerce, Inc. ($698,000) and ReachLocal ($610,000). These gains were offset by gross realized losses of $10.2 million primarily from the liquidation or write off of the Company s warrant and equity investments in six portfolio companies and the Company s debt investments in four portfolio companies, including the settlement of our outstanding debt investment in The Neat Company ($6.2 million).  
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized net realized gains of $6.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded gross realized gains of $6.8 million primarily from the sale of investments in three portfolio companies, including Box, Inc. ($2.7 million), Atrenta, Inc. ($2.6 million), and Egalet Corporation ($652,000), and approximately $871,000 from subsequent recoveries received on two previously written-off debt investments. These gains were offset by gross realized losses of $424,000 from the liquidation of the Company s investments in one portfolio company.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded gross realized gains of $11.6 million primarily from the sale of investments in seven portfolio companies, including Box, Inc. ($2.7 million), Atrenta, Inc. ($2.6 million), Cempra, Inc. ($2.0 million), Celladon Corporation ($1.4 million), Egalet Corporation ($652,000), Everyday Health, Inc. ($387,000) and Identiv, Inc. ($304,000), and $1.4 million from subsequent recoveries received on two previously written-off debt investments. These gains were partially offset by gross realized losses of $3.2 million from the liquidation of the Company s investments in nine portfolio companies. 
 Investment Collateral 
 In the majority of cases, the Company collateralizes its investments by obtaining a first priority security interest in a portfolio company s assets, which may include its intellectual property. In other cases, the Company may obtain a negative pledge covering a company s intellectual property. At September 30, 2016, approximately 91.2% of the Company s debt investments were in a senior secured first lien position, with 42.3% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property; 45.6% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company and the portfolio company was prohibited from pledging or encumbering its intellectual property, or subject to a negative pledge; and 3.3% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property, with a second lien on the portfolio company s cash and accounts receivable. The remaining 8.8% of the Company s debt investments were secured by a second priority security interest in all of the portfolio company s assets, other than intellectual property.  At September 30, 2016 the Company had no equipment only liens on material investments in the Company s portfolio companies.

Income Recognition  
 The Company records interest income on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. OID initially represents the value of detachable equity warrants obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of debt securities and is accreted into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if management otherwise does not expect that principal, interest and other obligations due will be collected in full, the Company will generally place the loan on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest due has been paid or the Company believes the portfolio company has demonstrated the ability to repay the Company s current and future contractual obligations. Any uncollected interest related to prior periods is reversed from income in the period that collection of the interest receivable is determined to be doubtful. However, the Company may make exceptions to this policy if the investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had six debt investments on non-accrual with a cumulative investment cost and approximate fair value of $46.2 million and $9.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Company had five debt investments on non-accrual with cumulative investment cost and fair value of approximately $47.4 million and $23.2 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2015, the Company had one debt investment with an investment cost and fair value of approximately $20.1 million and $14.9 million, respectively, for which only the PIK interest was on non-accrual. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a realized loss of approximately $6.2 million on the settlement of one debt investment that was on non-accrual at December 31, 2015.  In addition, the Company recognized realized losses of $419,000 and $430,000 on the liquidation and partial write off, respectively, of two debt investment that were on non-accrual as of December 31, 2015. 
 Fee income, generally collected in advance, includes loan commitment and facility fees for due diligence and structuring, as well as fees for transaction services and management services rendered by us to portfolio companies and other third parties. Loan and commitment fees are amortized into income over the contractual life of the loan. Management fees are generally recognized as income when the services are rendered. Loan origination fees are capitalized and then amortized into interest income using the effective interest rate method. In certain loan arrangements, warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees. The Company had approximately $37.0 million of unamortized fees at September 30, 2016, of which approximately $34.5 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of the Company s current debt investments and approximately $2.5 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone. At December 31, 2015 the Company had approximately $26.1 million of unamortized fees, of which approximately $23.6 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of the Company s current debt investments and approximately $2.5 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone.  
 The Company recognizes nonrecurring fees amortized over the remaining term of the loan commencing in the quarter relating to specific loan modifications. Certain fees may still be recognized as one-time fees, including prepayment penalties, fees related to select covenant default, waiver fees and acceleration of previously deferred loan fees and OID related to early loan pay-off or material modification of the specific debt outstanding. 
 In addition, the Company may also be entitled to an exit fee that is amortized into income over the life of the loan. Loan exit fees to be paid at the termination of the loan are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loan. At September 30, 2016 the Company had approximately $30.8 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $28.0 million was included as a component of the cost basis of the Company s current debt investments and approximately $2.8 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments. At December 31, 2015 the Company had approximately $22.7 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $17.4 million was included a component of the cost basis of the Company s current debt investments and approximately $5.3 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments. 
 The Company has debt investments in its portfolio that contain a PIK provision. Contractual PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or management does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Company recorded approximately $2.1 million and $1.5 million in PIK income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded approximately $5.7 million and $3.3 million in PIK income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, PIK and exit fee income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments.  
 In certain investment transactions, the Company may provide advisory services. For services that are separately identifiable and external evidence exists to substantiate fair value, income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment transaction closes. The Company had no income from advisory services in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 Fair value estimates are made at discrete points in time based on relevant information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The Company believes that the carrying amounts of its financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, receivables including escrow receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate the fair values of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments. The April 2019 Notes, the September 2019 Notes (together with the April 2019 Notes, the  2019 Notes ), the 2024 Notes, the 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and the SBA debentures, provide a strategic advantage as sources of liquidity due to their flexible structure, long-term duration, and low fixed interest rates. At September 30, 2016, the April 2019 Notes were trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, for $25.55 per share at par value, the September 2019 Notes were trading on the NYSE for $25.47 per share at par value and the 2024 Notes were trading on the NYSE for $25.66 per share at par value. The par value at underwriting for each of these notes was $25.00 per share. Based on market quotations on or around September 30, 2016, the 2021 Asset-Backed Notes were quoted for 0.997 per dollar at par value. Calculated based on the net present value of payments over the term of the notes using estimated market rates for similar notes and remaining terms, the fair value of the SBA debentures would be approximately $199.8 million, compared to the carrying amount of $190.2 million as of September 30, 2016.  
 See the accompanying Consolidated Schedule of Investments for the fair value of the Company s investments. The methodology for the determination of the fair value of the Company s investments is discussed in Note 2.  
 The liabilities of the Company are recorded at amortized cost and not at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The following tables provide additional information about the fair value and level in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

 Long-Term SBA Debentures  
 On September 27, 2006, HT II received a license to operate as a SBIC under the SBIC program and is able to borrow funds from the SBA against eligible investments and additional contributions to regulatory capital. Under the Small Business Investment Company Act and current SBA policy applicable to SBICs, a SBIC can have outstanding at any time SBA guaranteed debentures up to twice the amount of its regulatory capital. With the Company s net investment of $44.0 million in HT II as of September 30, 2016, HT II has the capacity to issue a total of $41.2 million of SBA guaranteed debentures, subject to SBA approval, of which $41.2 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, HT II has paid the SBA commitment fees and facility fees of approximately $1.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 the Company held investments in HT II in 36 companies with a fair value of approximately $68.7 million, accounting for approximately 5.2% of the Company s total investment portfolio at September 30, 2016. HT II held approximately $100.4 million in assets and accounted for approximately 5.5% of the Company s total assets prior to consolidation at September 30, 2016. 
 On May 26, 2010, HT III received a license to operate as a SBIC under the SBIC program and is able to borrow funds from the SBA against eligible investments and additional contributions to regulatory capital. With the Company s net investment of $74.5 million in HT III as of September 30, 2016, HT III has the capacity to issue a total of $149.0 million of SBA guaranteed debentures, of which $149.0 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, HT III has paid the SBA commitment fees and facility fees of approximately $1.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company held investments in HT III in 51 companies with a fair value of approximately $230.7 million, accounting for approximately 17.5% of the Company s total investment portfolio at September 30, 2016. HT III held approximately $252.7 million in assets and accounted for approximately 14.0% of the Company s total assets prior to consolidation at September 30, 2016. 
 SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, SBICs must devote 25.0% of its investment activity to  smaller  enterprises as defined by the SBA. A smaller enterprise is one that has a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $2.0 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. Through the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries HT II and HT III, the Company plans to provide long-term loans to qualifying small businesses, and in connection therewith, make equity investments.  
   
 51 

HT II and HT   III are periodically examined and audited by the SBA s staff to determine their compliance with SBA regulations. If HT II or HT III fails to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibi  t HT II s or HT III s use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit HT II or HT III from making new investments. In addition, HT II or HT III may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to the Co  mpany if they do not have sufficient capital in accordance with SBA regulations. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect the Company because HT II and HT III are the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries. HT II and HT III were in compliance   with the terms of the SBIC s leverage as of September 30, 2016 as a result of having sufficient capital as defined under the SBA regulations.  
 The rates of borrowings under various draws from the SBA beginning in March 2009 are set semiannually in March and September and range from 2.25% to 4.62% excluding annual fees. Interest payments on SBA debentures are payable semiannually. There are no principal payments required on these issues prior to maturity and no prepayment penalties. Debentures under the SBA generally mature ten years after being borrowed. Based on the initial draw down date of March 2009, the initial maturity of SBA debentures will occur in March 2019. In addition, the SBA charges a fee that is set annually, depending on the Federal fiscal year the leverage commitment was delegated by the SBA, regardless of the date that the leverage was drawn by the SBIC. The annual fees related to HT II debentures that pooled on September 22, 2010 were 0.406% and 0.285%, depending upon the year in which the underlying commitment was closed. The annual fees on other debentures have been set at 0.906%. The annual fees related to HT III debentures that pooled on March 27, 2013 were 0.804%. The annual fees on other debentures have been set at 0.515%. The rates of borrowings on the Company s SBA debentures range from 3.05% to 5.53% when including these annual fees. 
  The average amount of debentures outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 for HT II was approximately $41.2 million with an average interest rate of approximately 4.52%. The average amount of debentures outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 for HT III was approximately $149.0 million with an average interest rate of approximately 3.43%. The average amount of debentures outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for HT II was approximately $41.2 million with an average interest rate of approximately 4.52%. The average amount of debentures outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for HT III was approximately $149.0 million with an average interest rate of approximately 3.43%. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of interest expense and related fees and cash paid for interest expense for the SBA debentures are as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of combined outstanding SBA guaranteed debentures is $350.0 million, subject to periodic adjustments by the SBA. In aggregate, at September 30, 2016, with the Company s net investment of $118.5 million, HT II and HT III have the capacity to issue a total of $190.2 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to SBA approval. At September 30, 2016, the Company has issued $190.2 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures in the Company s SBIC subsidiaries.  
 The Company reported the following SBA debentures outstanding principal balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

 The 2014 Loans are serviced by the Company pursuant to a sale and servicing agreement, which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Company performs certain servicing and administrative functions with respect to the 2014 Loans. The Company is entitled to receive a monthly fee from the 2014 Securitization Issuer for servicing the 2014 Loans. This servicing fee is equal to the product of one-twelfth (or in the case of the first payment date, a fraction equal to the number of days from and including October 5, 2014 through and including December 5, 2014 over 360) of 2.00% and the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 2014 Loans plus collections on deposit in the 2014 Securitization Issuer s collections account, as of the first day of the related collection period (the period from the 5th day of the immediately preceding calendar month through the 4th day of the calendar month in which a payment date occurs, and for the first payment date, the period from and including October 5, 2014, to the close of business on December 5, 2014).The Company also serves as administrator to the 2014 Securitization Issuer under an administration agreement, which includes customary representations, warranties and covenants.

Under the terms of the 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, the Company is required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through interest and principal collections from the underlying securitized debt portfolio, which may be used to pay monthly interest and principal payments on the 2021 Asset-Backed Notes. The Company has segregated these funds and classified them as restricted cash. There was approximately $9.0 million and $9.2 million of restricted cash as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, funded through interest collections.

Convertible Senior Notes   
 In April 2011, the Company issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2016 (the  Convertible Senior Notes ). The Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016.  
 Prior to the close of business on October 14, 2015, holders were able to convert their Convertible Senior Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes. On or after October 15, 2015 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders were able to convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time. Throughout the life of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of approximately $74.8 million of the Convertible Senior Notes exercised their conversion rights. These Convertible Senior Notes were settled with a combination of cash equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes and approximately 1.6 million shares of the Company s common stock, or $24.3 million. 
 The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt for the proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount. The loss was partially offset by a gain in the amount of the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the Convertible Senior Notes and the fair value of the debt instrument. The net loss on extinguishment of debt the Company recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,000. The Company did not record a loss on extinguishment of debt in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The loss on extinguishment of debt was classified as a component of net investment income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
 The Convertible Senior Notes were accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 470-20 ( Debt Instruments with Conversion and Other Options ). In accounting for the Convertible Senior Notes, the Company estimated at the time of issuance that the values of the debt and the embedded conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes were approximately 92.8% and 7.2%, respectively. The original issue discount of 7.2% attributable to the conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes was recorded in  capital in excess of par value  in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded interest expense comprised of both stated interest expense as well as accretion of the original issue discount resulting in an estimated effective interest rate of approximately 8.1%.  
 As of December 31, 2015, the components of the carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes were as follows:  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of interest expense, fees and cash paid for interest expense for the Convertible Senior Notes were as follows:

The Company expects to continue discussions with various other potential lenders to join the facility; however, there can be no assurances that additional lenders will join the Wells Facility.  Borrowings under the Wells Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.25%, and the Wells Facility has an advance rate of 50% against eligible debt investments. The Wells Facility is secured by all of the assets of Hercules Funding II.  The Wells Facility requires payment of a non-use fee on a scale of 0.0% to 0.50% depending on the average monthly outstanding balance under the facility relative to the maximum amount of commitments at such time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, this non-use fee was $155,000 and $336,000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, this non-use fee was $41,000 and $229,000, respectively. 
 The Wells Facility also includes various financial and other covenants applicable to the Company and the Company s subsidiaries, in addition to those applicable to Hercules Funding II, including covenants relating to certain changes of control of the Company and Hercules Funding II. Among other things, these covenants also require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to worth ratio, minimum interest coverage ratio, minimum portfolio funding liquidity, and a minimum tangible net worth in an amount, when added to outstanding subordinated indebtedness, that is in excess of $500.0 million plus 90% of the cumulative amount of equity raised after June 30, 2014.  As of September 30, 2016, the minimum tangible net worth covenant increased to $637.2 million as a result of the March 2015 follow-on public offering of 7.6 million shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of approximately $100.4 million and the 4.1 million shares of common stock issued under the At-The-Market ( ATM ) equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities ( JMP ) for gross proceeds of $52.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Wells Facility provides for customary events of default, including, without limitation, with respect to payment defaults, breach of representations and covenants, certain key person provisions, cross acceleration provisions to certain other debt, lien and judgment limitations, and bankruptcy. 
 On June 20, 2011 the Company paid $1.1 million in structuring fees in connection with the original Wells Facility.  In connection with an amendment to the original Wells Facility in August 2014, the Company paid an additional $750,000 in structuring fees and in connection with the amendment in December 2015, the Company paid an additional $188,000 in structuring fees. These fees are being amortized through the end of the term of the Wells Facility.

The Union Bank Facility replaced the company s credit facility (the  Prior Union Bank Facility ) entered into on August 14, 2014 (as amended and restated from time to time) with MUFG Union Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party to the Prior Union Bank Facility from time to time.  Any references to amounts related to the Union Bank Facility prior to May 5, 2016 were incurred and relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility. 
 On July 18, 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2016 with MUFG Union Bank, N.A. The Amendment amends certain definitions relating to borrowings which accrue interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR Loans ) and (ii) the method(s) for calculating interest on and the paying of certain fees related to such LIBOR Loans. 
 Under the Union Bank Facility, MUFG Union Bank made commitments of $75.0 million. The Union Bank Facility contains an accordion feature, in which the Company can increase the credit line up to an aggregate of $200.0 million, funded by additional lenders and with the agreement of MUFG Union Bank and subject to other customary conditions. There can be no assurances that additional lenders will join the Union Bank Facility to increase available borrowings. Borrowings under the Union Bank Facility generally bear interest at either (i) if such borrowing is a base rate loan, a base rate per annum equal to the federal funds rate plus 1.00%, LIBOR plus 1.00% or MUFG Union Bank s prime rate, in each case, plus a margin of 1.25% or (ii) if such borrowing is a LIBOR loan, a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.25%, and the Union Bank Facility generally has an advance rate of 50% against eligible debt investments. The Union Bank Facility is secured by all of the assets of HT III. 
 The Union Bank Facility requires payment of a non-use fee during the revolving credit availability period on a scale of 0.25% to 0.50% depending on the average monthly outstanding balance under the facility relative to the maximum amount of commitments at such time. The Company paid a one-time $562,500 structuring fee in connection with the Union Bank Facility. Although the Company did not incur any non-use fees under the Union Bank Facility prior to May 5, 2016, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company incurred non-use fees under the existing and previous Union Bank Facility of $96,000 and $277,000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the non-use fee was $96,000 and $284,000, respectively.  
 The Union Bank Facility also includes various financial and other covenants applicable to the Company and the Company s subsidiaries, in addition to those applicable to HT III, including covenants relating to certain changes of control of the Company and HT III. Among other things, these covenants also require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to worth ratio, minimum interest coverage ratio, minimum portfolio funding liquidity, and a minimum tangible net worth in an amount that is in excess of $500.0 million plus 90% of the cumulative amount of equity raised after June 30, 2014. As of September 30, 2016, the minimum tangible net worth covenant increased to $685.2 million as a result of the March 2015 follow-on public offering of 7.6 million shares of common stock for total net proceeds of approximately $100.1 million and the 4.1 million shares of common stock issued under the ATM equity distribution agreement with JMP for net proceeds of $50.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Union Bank Facility provides for customary events of default, including with respect to payment defaults, breach of representations and covenants, servicer defaults, certain key person provisions, cross default provisions to certain other debt, lien and judgment limitations, and bankruptcy.

Citibank Credit Facility   
 The Company, through Hercules Funding Trust I, an affiliated statutory trust, had a securitized credit facility (the  Citibank Credit Facility ) with Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. ( Citigroup ), which expired under normal terms. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company paid off all principal and interest owed under the Citibank Credit Facility. Citigroup has an equity participation right through a warrant participation agreement on the pool of debt investments and warrants collateralized under the Citibank Credit Facility. Pursuant to the warrant participation agreement, the Company granted to Citigroup a 10% participation in all warrants held as collateral. However, no additional warrants were included in collateral subsequent to the facility amendment on May 2, 2007. As a result, Citigroup is entitled to 10% of the realized gains on the warrants until the realized gains paid to Citigroup pursuant to the agreement equal $3.75 million (the  Maximum Participation Limit ). The obligations under the warrant participation agreement continue even after the Citibank Credit Facility is terminated until the Maximum Participation Limit has been reached.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reduced its realized gain by approximately $146,000 for Citigroup s participation from the acquisition proceeds received on equity exercised from warrants that were included in the collateral pool. The Company also recorded a decrease in participation liability and an increase in unrealized appreciation by a net amount of approximately $3,000 primarily due to depreciation of fair value on the pool of warrants collateralized under the warrant participation and the acquisition proceeds received on the Company s Ping Identity Corporation equity investment. The remaining value of Citigroup s participation right on unrealized gains in the related equity investments is approximately $114,000 as of September 30, 2016 and is included in accrued liabilities. There can be no assurances that the unrealized appreciation of the warrants will not be higher or lower in future periods due to fluctuations in the value of the warrants, thereby increasing or reducing the effect on the cost of borrowing. Since inception of the agreement, the Company has paid Citigroup approximately $2.4 million under the warrant participation agreement thereby reducing realized gains by this amount. The Company will continue to pay Citigroup under the warrant participation agreement until the Maximum Participation Limit is reached or the warrants expire. The remaining warrants subject to the Citigroup participation agreement are set to expire in January 2017. 
   
 5. Income taxes  
 The Company intends to operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, as such, will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of taxable income and gains distributed as dividends to stockholders. Taxable income includes the Company s taxable interest, dividend and fee income, reduced by certain deductions, as well as taxable net realized securities gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.  
 To qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, the Company is required to meet certain income and asset diversification tests in addition to distributing dividends of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, to its stockholders. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is based upon the annual earnings estimated by the management of the Company. To the extent that the Company s earnings fall below the amount of dividend distributions declared, however, a portion of the total amount of the Company s distributions for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company s stockholders.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company declared a distribution of $0.31 per share. The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made annually as of the end of the Company s taxable year generally based upon its taxable income for the full taxable year and distributions paid for the full taxable year. As a result, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full taxable year. If the Company had determined the tax attributes of our distributions taxable year-to-date as of September 30, 2016, 100% would be from our current and accumulated earnings and profits. However, there can be no certainty to stockholders that this determination is representative of what the actual tax attributes of the Company s 2016 distributions to stockholders will be.  
 As a RIC, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company distributes dividends in a timely manner to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of the Company s ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the Company s capital gain net income for the 1-year period ending October 31 of each such calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income realized, but not distributed, in preceding calendar years. The Company will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which the Company is required to pay corporate income tax (such as retained net capital gains).  
   
 60 

Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry over taxabl  e income in excess of current taxable year distributions from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distributio  n in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of distributions paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent the Company chooses to carry over taxable income into the next taxable y  ear, dividend distributions declared and paid by the Company in a taxable year may differ from the Company s taxable income for that taxable year as such dividend distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distri  bution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.   
 The Company has taxable subsidiaries which are designed to hold certain portfolio investments in an effort to limit potential legal liability and/or comply with source-income type requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. These taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes and the portfolio investments held by the taxable subsidiaries are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements, and recorded at fair value. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. Any income generated by these taxable subsidiaries would be taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income. 
  Taxable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $66.1 million or $0.91 per share. Taxable net realized gains for the same period was $8.1 million or approximately $0.11 per share. Taxable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $49.6 million or $0.72 per share. Taxable net realized gains for the same period were $9.1 million or approximately $0.13 per share. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid approximately $201,000 of tax expense and had approximately $333,000 of accrued but unpaid tax expense as of the balance sheet date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid approximately $736,000 of tax expense and did not have an accrued but unpaid amount as of the balance sheet date. 
 The Company intends to distribute approximately $8.2 million of spillover earnings from ordinary income from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the Company s stockholders in 2016. 
   
 6. Stockholders  Equity  
   
 On August 16, 2013, the Company entered into an ATM equity distribution agreement (the  Equity Distribution Agreement ) with JMP and on March 7, 2016, the Company renewed the Equity Distribution Agreement. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Company may offer and sell up to 8.0 million shares of its common stock from time to time through JMP, as its sales agent. Sales of the Company s common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be  at the market,  as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or similar securities exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. 
   
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company sold 2.1 million and 4.1 million shares of common stock for total accumulated net proceeds of approximately $26.5 million and $50.2 million, respectively, including $986,000 and 
 $1.8 million of offering expenses, respectively. The Company did not sell any shares under the program during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company generally uses net proceeds from these offerings to make investments, to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2016 approximately 3.2 million shares remain available for issuance and sale under the equity distribution agreement. See  Note 12   Subsequent Events . 
   
 On February 24, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan permitting the Company to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its common stock. This plan expired on August 24, 2015. On August 27, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a replacement stock repurchase plan permitting the Company to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its common stock and on February 17, 2016 the Board of Directors extended the program until August 23, 2016, after which the plan expired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company repurchased 449,588 shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $10.64 per share and a total cost of approximately $4.8 million. The Company did not make any repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2016. See  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  for further information on the repurchases made during the period.  
   
 On March 27, 2015, the Company raised approximately $100.1 million, after deducting offering expenses of $323,000, in a public offering of 7,590,000 shares of its common stock. 
   
 61 

At the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on July 7, 2015, the Company s common stockholders approved a proposal to allow the Company to issue common stock at a discount from its then current net asset value   ( NAV ) per share, which was effective until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders   on July 7, 2016.   Such authorization was   not   sought   at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   the year ended December 31, 2015   the Company did not issue common stock at a discount to NAV.  
 The Company has issued stock options for common stock subject to future issuance, of which 681,004 and 622,171 were outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
 7. Equity Incentive Plan  
 The Company and its stockholders have authorized and adopted the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan ) for purposes of attracting and retaining the services of its executive officers and key employees. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 12.0 million shares of common stock.  
 The Company and its stockholders have authorized and adopted the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan (the  2006 Plan  and, together with the 2004 Plan, the  Plans ) for purposes of attracting and retaining the services of its Board of Directors. Under the 2006 Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 1.0 million shares of common stock. The Company filed an exemptive relief request with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to allow options to be issued under the 2006 Plan which was approved on October 10, 2007.  
 On June 21, 2007, the stockholders approved amendments to the 2004 Plan and the 2006 Plan allowing for the grant of restricted stock. The amended Plans limit the combined maximum amount of restricted stock that may be issued under both Plans to 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company s stock on the effective date of the Plans plus 10% of the number of shares of stock issued or delivered by the Company during the terms of the Plans. The amendments further specify that no one person shall be granted awards of restricted stock relating to more than 25% of the shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. Further, the amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all of the Company s outstanding warrants, options and rights, together with any restricted stock issued pursuant to the Plans, at the time of issuance shall not exceed 25% of its outstanding voting securities, except that if the amount of voting securities that would result from such exercise of all of the Company s outstanding warrants, options and rights issued to the Company s directors, officers and employees, together with any restricted stock issued pursuant to the Plans, would exceed 15% of the Company s outstanding voting securities, then the total amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options and rights, together with any restricted stock issued pursuant to the Plans, at the time of issuance shall not exceed 20% of the Company s outstanding voting securities.  
 The following table summarizes the common stock option activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The following table summarizes common stock options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016:  

62 

Options generally vest 33% one year after the date of grant and ratably over the succeeding 24 months.   
 All options may be exercised for a period ending seven years after the date of grant. At September 30, 2016 options for 357,791 shares were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $14.55 per share with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 4.62 years.  
 The Company determined that the fair value of options granted under the 2006 and 2004 Plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $89,000 and $57,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately $144,000 and $201,000 of share-based cost due to stock option grants was expensed, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 there was approximately $127,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.0 years.  
 The Company follows ASC Topic 718 ( Compensation   Stock Compensation ) to account for stock options granted. Under ASC Topic 718, compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rate and expected option life. The fair value of options granted is based upon a Black Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company granted 552,214 shares and 676,340 shares, respectively, of restricted stock pursuant to the Plans. The Company determined that the fair value of restricted stock granted under the 2006 and 2004 Plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $6.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed approximately $5.5 million and $7.0 million of compensation expense related to restricted stock, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $9.2 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.87 years.  
 The following table summarizes the activities for the Company s unvested restricted stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The SEC, through an exemptive order granted on June 22, 2010, approved amendments to the Plans which allow participants to elect to have the Company withhold shares of the Company s common stock to pay for the exercise price and applicable taxes with respect to an option exercise ( net issuance exercise ). The exemptive order also permits the holders of restricted stock to elect to have the Company withhold shares of the Company s stock to pay the applicable taxes due on restricted stock at the time of vesting. Each individual can make a cash payment at the time of option exercise or to pay taxes on restricted stock.

8. Earnings Per Share   
 Shares used in the computation of the Company s basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  

In the table above, unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents are treated as participating securities for calculating earnings per share. 
   
 Unvested common stock options are also included in the denominator for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the dilutive effect of the Convertible Senior Notes under the treasury stock method was also included in this calculation because the Company s share price was greater than the conversion price in effect ($11.12 as of September 30, 2015) for the Convertible Senior Notes for such periods. The Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016, as such there is no potential additional dilutive effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 The calculation of change in net assets resulting from operations per common share assuming dilution, excludes all anti-dilutive shares. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of anti-dilutive shares, as calculated based on the weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the periods, was approximately 646,783 shares and 642,088 shares, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of anti-dilutive shares, as calculated based on the weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the periods, was approximately 679,253 shares and 627,526 shares, respectively. 
   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue 200.0 million shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote.

9. Financial Highlights   
 Following is a schedule of financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

(1)   
 
 All per share activity is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period, except net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions, which is based on the common shares outstanding as of the relevant balance sheet date.    

(2)   
 
 Stock option expense is a non-cash expense that has no effect on net asset value. Pursuant to ASC Topic 718, net investment income includes the expense associated with the granting of stock options which is offset by a corresponding increase in paid-in capital.     

(3)   
 
 The total return for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 equals the change in the ending market value over the beginning of the period price per share plus distributions paid per share during the period, divided by the beginning price assuming the distribution is reinvested on the date of the distribution. As such, the total return is not annualized. The total return does not reflect any sales load that must be paid by investors.    

(4)   
 
 All ratios are calculated based on weighted average net assets for the relevant period and are annualized.    

(5)   
 
 The portfolio turnover rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 equals the lesser of investment portfolio purchases or sales during the period, divided by the average investment portfolio value during the period. As such, portfolio turnover rate is not annualized.    

(6)    
 
 Includes distributions on unvested shares.    

65 

10. Commitments and Contingencies   
   
 The Company s commitments and contingencies consist primarily of unused commitments to extend credit in the form of loans to the Company s portfolio companies. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the Company. Since a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded contractual commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, the Company s disclosure of unfunded contractual commitments includes only those which are available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $73.9 million of unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which were available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones.  
 The Company also had approximately $100.0 million of non-binding term sheets outstanding at September 30, 2016. Non-binding outstanding term sheets are subject to completion of the Company s due diligence and final investment committee approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio companies. These non-binding term sheets generally convert to contractual commitments in approximately 90 days from signing. Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
 The fair value of the Company s unfunded commitments is considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding, given that interest rates are generally pegged to a market indices and given the existence of milestones, conditions and/or obligations imbedded in the borrowing agreements.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s unfunded contractual commitments available at the request of the portfolio company, including undrawn revolving facilities, and unencumbered by milestones are as follows: 

(1)   
 
 Amount represents unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which are available at the request of the portfolio company. Amount excludes unfunded commitments which are unavailable due to the borrower having not met certain milestones.    

66 

Certain premises are leased under agreements which expire at various dates through March 2020. Total rent expense amounted to approximately $420,000 and $1.3   million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Total rent expense amounted to   approximately $414,000 and $1.2   million   during the same periods ended September 30, 2015. The Company s contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 include:   

(1)   
 
 Excludes commitments to extend credit to the Company s portfolio companies.     

(2)   
 
 The Company also has a warrant participation agreement with Citigroup. See Note 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.     

(4)   
 
 Amounts represent future principal repayments and not the carrying value of each liability. See Note 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.    

(5)   
 
 Long-term facility leases.     

 The Company may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on the Company in connection with the activities of its portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect any current matters will materially affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.

 On October 26, 2016 the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend distribution of $0.31 per share to be paid on November 21, 2016 to stockholders of record as of November 14, 2016. This dividend distribution represents the Company s forty-fifth consecutive dividend declaration since the Company s IPO, bringing the total cumulative dividend declared to date to $12.47 per share.  
 2024 Notes ATM Program 
 The Company entered into a debt distribution agreement, dated October 11, 2016, pursuant to which it may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% notes due 2024 (the  Additional 2024 Notes ) through FBR Capital Markets   Co. acting as its sales agent (the  2024 Notes Agent ). Sales of the Additional 2024 Notes, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be  at the market offerings  as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE, or similar securities exchange or sales made through a market maker other than on an exchange at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. 
 The 2024 Notes Agent will receive a commission from the Company equal to up to 2.00% of the gross sales of any Additional 2024 Notes sold through the 2024 Notes Agent under the agreement. The 2024 Notes Agent is not required to sell any specific principal amount of Notes, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its sales and trading practices to sell the Additional 2024 Notes. 
 The Additional 2024 Notes offered hereby will be a further issuance of, are fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with, and form a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes initially issued by the Company on July 14, 2014, May 2, 2016, and June 27, 2016, respectively. The 2024 Notes will mature on July 30, 2024. The Company will pay interest on the Additional 2024 Notes on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on October 30, 2016. Any purchaser of the Additional 2024 Notes will pay for any interest accrued from the interest payment date preceding the issuance date of the Additional 2024 Notes up to, but excluding, the issuance date of the Additional 2024 Notes. The Company may redeem the 2024 Notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price set forth under the terms of the indenture. The Additional 2024 Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. 
 The Additional 2024 Notes will be the Company s direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu, or equally in right of payment, with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by Hercules Capital, Inc. 
 The 2024 Notes are listed on the NYSE, and trade on the NYSE under the symbol  HTGX.  The Additional 2024 Notes are expected to trade  flat,  which means that purchasers in the secondary market will not pay, and sellers will not receive, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Additional 2024 Notes that is not reflected in the trading price.  
 Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and as of October 31, 2016, the Company sold 137,250 notes for approximately $3.5 million in aggregate principal amount. As of October 31, 2016 approximately $146.5 million in aggregate principal amount remains available for issuance and sale under the debt distribution agreement.

In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to the factors discussed under Item 1A   Risk Factors  of Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, Item 1A   Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 25, 2016 and under  Forward-Looking Statements  of this Item 2.  
 Overview  
   
 We are a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high-growth, innovative venture capital-backed companies in a variety of technology, life sciences, and sustainable and renewable technology industries. We source our investments through our principal office located in Palo Alto, CA, as well as through our additional offices in Boston, MA, New York, NY, Washington, DC, Santa Monica, CA, Hartford, CT, and San Diego, CA. 

69 

Our goal is to be the   leading structured debt financing provider for venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries requiring sophisticated and customized financing solutions. Our strategy is to evaluate and invest in a broad range of technology-related indus  tries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology and to offer a full suite of growth capital products. We invest primarily in structured debt with warrants and, t  o a lesser extent, in senior debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in private companies but also have investments in public companies.  
   
 We use the term  structured debt with warrants  to refer to any debt investment, such as a senior or subordinated secured loan, that is coupled with an equity component, including warrants, options or other rights to purchase common or preferred stock. Our structured debt with warrants investments typically are secured by some or all of the assets of the portfolio company. 
   
 Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our warrant and equity-related investments. Our primary business objectives are to increase our net income, net operating income and net asset value by investing in structured debt with warrants and equity of venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries with attractive current yields and the potential for equity appreciation and realized gains. Our equity ownership in our portfolio companies may exceed 25% of the voting securities of such companies, which represents a controlling interest under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). In some cases, we receive the right to make additional equity investments in our portfolio companies in connection with future equity financing rounds. Capital that we provide directly to venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries is generally used for growth and general working capital purposes as well as in select cases for acquisitions or recapitalizations. 
   
 We also make investments in qualifying small businesses through our two wholly owned small business investment companies ( SBICs ). Our SBIC subsidiaries, Hercules Technology II, L.P. ( HT II ) and Hercules Technology III, L.P. ( HT III ), hold approximately $100.4 million and $252.7 million in assets, respectively, and accounted for approximately 5.5% and 14.0% of our total assets, respectively, prior to consolidation at September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of combined outstanding Small Business Administration ( SBA ) guaranteed debentures is $350.0 million, subject to periodic adjustments by the SBA. In aggregate, at September 30, 2016, with our net investment of $118.5 million, HT II and HT III have the capacity to issue a total of $190.2 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to SBA approval. At September 30, 2016, we have issued $190.2 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures in our SBIC subsidiaries. 
   
 We have qualified as and have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Pursuant to this election, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level taxes on any income and gains that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. However, our qualification and election to be treated as a RIC requires that we comply with provisions contained in Subchapter M of the Code. For example, as a RIC we must earn 90% or more of our gross income for each taxable year from qualified earnings, typically referred to as  good income,  as well as satisfy certain quarterly asset diversification and annual income distribution requirements. 
   
 We are an internally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  which includes securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. 
   
 Our portfolio is comprised of, and we anticipate that our portfolio will continue to be comprised of, investments primarily in technology related companies at various stages of their development. Consistent with requirements under the 1940 Act, we invest primarily in United-States based companies and to a lesser extent in foreign companies. 
   
 We regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.

Portfolio and Investment Activity   
 The total fair value of our investment portfolio was $1.3 billion at September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015. The fair value of our debt investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.2 billion, compared to a fair value of approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the equity portfolio at September 30, 2016 was approximately $68.8 million, compared to a fair value of approximately $67.4 million at December 31, 2015. The fair value of the warrant portfolio at September 30, 2016 was approximately $27.7 million, compared to a fair value of approximately $23.0 million at December 31, 2015.  
 Portfolio Activity  
 Our investments in portfolio companies take a variety of forms, including unfunded contractual commitments and funded investments. From time to time, unfunded contractual commitments depend upon a portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment is available to the portfolio company, which is expected to affect our funding levels. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Debt commitments generally fund over the two succeeding quarters from close. Not all debt commitments represent future cash requirements. Similarly, unfunded contractual commitments may expire without being drawn and thus do not represent future cash requirements.  
 Prior to entering into a contractual commitment, we generally issue a non-binding term sheet to a prospective portfolio company. Non-binding term sheets are subject to completion of our due diligence and final investment committee approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio companies. These non-binding term sheets generally convert to contractual commitments in approximately 90 days from signing.  Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 Our portfolio activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was comprised of the following:  

(1)   
 
 Includes restructured loans and renewals in addition to new commitments.     

(2)   
 
 Amount represents unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which are available at the request of the portfolio company. Amount excludes unfunded commitments which are unavailable due to the borrower having not met certain milestones.     

(3)   
 
 Funded amounts include borrowings on revolving facilities.    

71 

We receive   principal   payments   on   our debt investment portfolio based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive principal repayments for some of our loans   prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these early principal repayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received approximately $334.7 million in aggregate pr  incipal repayments. Of the approximately $334.7 million of aggregate principal repayments, approximately $77.9 million were scheduled principal payments and approximately $256.8 million were early principal repayments related to 33 portfolio companies. Of   the approximately $256.8 million early principal repayments,   approximately $54.9 million were early repayments due to merger and acquisition transactions or initial public offerings ( IPOs ) for   three   portfolio companies.  
 Total portfolio investment activity (inclusive of unearned income and excluding activity related to taxes payable, escrow receivables and Citigroup warrant participation) as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

The following table shows the fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

A summary of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 at value by geographic location is as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016, we held warrants or equity positions in four companies that have filed registration statements on Form S-1 with the SEC in contemplation of potential initial public offerings. All four companies filed confidentially under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. There can be no assurance that companies that have yet to complete their initial public offerings will do so in a timely manner or at all.

Changes in Portfolio   
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income, primarily from our investments in debt securities, and commitment and facility fees. Interest income is recognized in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan or, in some cases, recognized as earned. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of capital gains, if any, on warrants or other equity-related securities that we acquire from our portfolio companies. Our investments generally range from $12.0 million to $25.0 million, although we may make investments in amounts above or below that range. As of September 30, 2016, our debt investments have a term of between two and seven years and typically bear interest at a rate ranging from approximately 4.0% to approximately 12.5%. In addition to the cash yields received on our debt investments, in some instances, our debt investments may also include any of the following: exit fees, balloon payment fees, commitment fees, success fees, payment-in-kind ( PIK ) provisions or prepayment fees which may be required to be included in income prior to receipt. 
 Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, with amortization of principal typically occurring over the term of the investment. In addition, our loans may include an interest-only period ranging from three to eighteen months or longer. In limited instances in which we choose to defer amortization of the loan for a period of time from the date of the initial investment, the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest become due at the maturity date.  
 Loan origination and commitment fees received in full at the inception of a loan are deferred and amortized into fee income as an enhancement to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan. We recognize nonrecurring fees amortized over the remaining term of the loan commencing in the quarter relating to specific loan modifications. We had approximately $37.0 million of unamortized fees at September 30, 2016, of which approximately $34.5 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of our current debt investments and approximately $2.5 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone. At December 31, 2015 we had approximately $26.1 million of unamortized fees, of which approximately $23.6 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of our current debt investments and approximately $2.5 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone. 
  Loan exit fees to be paid at the termination of the loan are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loan. At September 30, 2016 we had approximately $30.8 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $28.0 million was included as a component of the cost basis of our current debt investments and approximately $2.8 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments. At December 31, 2015 we had approximately $22.7 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $17.4 million was included as a component of the cost basis of our current debt investments and approximately $5.3 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments. 
 We have debt investments in our portfolio that contain a PIK provision. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan on specified capitalization dates. To maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders with other sources of income in the form of dividend distributions even though we have not yet collected the cash. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments. We recorded approximately $2.1 million and $1.5 million in PIK income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded approximately $5.7 million and $3.3 million in PIK income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 The core yield on our debt investments, which excludes any benefits from the fees and income related to early loan repayment acceleration of unamortized fees and income as well as prepayment of fees and includes income from expired commitments, was 13.2% and 12.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective yield on our debt investments, which includes the effects of fee and income accelerations attributed to early payoffs, restructuring, loan modifications and other one-time events, was 14.6% and 16.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective yield is derived by dividing total investment income by the weighted average earning investment portfolio assets outstanding during the quarter, excluding non-interest earning assets such as warrants and equity investments. Both the core yield and effective yield may be higher than what our common stockholders may realize as the core yield and effective yield do not reflect our expenses and any sales load paid by our common stockholders. 
 The total return for our investors was approximately 19.5% and -27.3% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total return equals the change in the ending market value over the beginning of the period price per share plus dividend distributions paid per share during the period, divided by the beginning price assuming the distribution is reinvested on the date of the distribution. The total return does not reflect any sales load that must be paid by investors. See  Note 9   Financial Highlights  included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

Portfolio Composition   
 Our portfolio companies are primarily privately held companies and public companies which are active in the drug discovery and development, sustainable and renewable technology, software, drug delivery, medical devices and equipment, media/content/info, internet consumer and business services, specialty pharmaceuticals, healthcare services, communications and networking, consumer and business products, surgical devices, semiconductors, biotechnology tools, electronics and computer hardware, diagnostic, and information services industry sectors. These sectors are characterized by high margins, high growth rates, consolidation and product and market extension opportunities. Value for companies in these sectors is often vested in intangible assets and intellectual property.  
 As of September 30, 2016, approximately 73.6% of the fair value of our portfolio was composed of investments in five industries: 27.0% was composed of investments in the drug discovery and development industry, 14.8% was comprised of investments in the sustainable and renewable technology industry, 14.3% was composed of investments in the software industry, 8.8% was composed of investments in the drug delivery industry, and 8.7% was composed of investments in the medical devices and equipment industry. 
 The following table shows the fair value of our portfolio by industry sector at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Industry and sector concentrations vary as new loans are recorded and loans pay off. Loan revenue, consisting of interest, fees, and recognition of gains on equity and warrants or other equity-related interests, can fluctuate materially when a loan is paid off or a related warrant or equity interest is sold. Revenue recognition in any given year can be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, our ten largest portfolio companies represented approximately 33.1% and 32.1% of the total fair value of our investments in portfolio companies, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had three and two investments, respectively, that represented 5% or more of our net assets. At September 30, 2016, we had six equity investments representing approximately 51.9% of the total fair value of our equity investments, and each represented 5% or more of the total fair value of our equity investments. At December 31, 2015, we had four equity investments which represented approximately 53.2% of the total fair value of our equity investments, and each represented 5% or more of the total fair value of our equity investments.  
 As of September 30, 2016 approximately 92.9% of the debt investment portfolio was priced at floating interest rates or floating interest rates with a Prime or LIBOR-based interest rate floor. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit should market interest rates rise in the near future.  
   
 74 

As of September 30, 2016,   91.2%   of our debt investments were in a senior secured first lien position with the remaining   8.8%   secured by a senior   second priority   security interest in all of the portfolio company s assets, other than intellectual property  .   In the majority of cases, we collateralize our investments by obtaining a first priority security interest in a portfolio company s assets, which may include its   intellectual property. In other cases, we may obtain a negative pledge covering a company s intellectual property. At September 30, 2016, of the approximately   91.2%   of our debt investments in a senior secured first lien position,   42.3%   were secured by a fi  rst priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property;   45.6%   were secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company and the portfolio company was prohibited from pledging o  r encumbering its intellectual property, or subject to a negative pledge; and 3.3% were secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property, with a second lien on the portfolio company s c  ash and accounts receivable. At September 30, 2016 we had no equipment only liens on material investments in our portfolio companies.  
 Our investments in senior secured debt with warrants have detachable equity enhancement features, typically in the form of warrants or other equity-related securities designed to provide us with an opportunity for capital appreciation. These features are treated as original issue discounts ( OID ) and are accreted into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement. Our warrant coverage generally ranges from 3% to 20% of the principal amount invested in a portfolio company, with a strike price generally equal to the most recent equity financing round. As of September 30, 2016, we held warrants in 138 portfolio companies, with a fair value of approximately $27.7 million. The fair value of our warrant portfolio increased by approximately $4.7 million, as compared to a fair value of $23.0 million at December 31, 2015 primarily related to the addition of warrants in 18 new and 11 existing portfolio companies during the period. 
 Our existing warrant holdings would require us to invest approximately $100.8 million to exercise such warrants as of September 30, 2016. Warrants may appreciate or depreciate in value depending largely upon the underlying portfolio company s performance and overall market conditions. Of the warrants that we have monetized since inception, we have realized multiples in the range of approximately 1.02x to 29.22x based on the historical rate of return on our investments. However, our warrants may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may experience losses from our warrant portfolio.  
 As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control.  Control investments  are defined in the 1940 Act as investments in those companies that we are deemed to  control , which, in general, includes a company in which we own 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or have greater than 50% representation on its board.  Affiliate investments  are investments in those companies that are  affiliated companies  of ours, as defined in the 1940 Act, which are not control investments. We are deemed to be an  affiliate  of a company in which we have invested if we own 5% or more, but generally less than 25%, of the voting securities of such company.  Non-control/non-affiliate investments  are investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments.  
 The following table summarizes our realized and unrealized gain and loss and changes in our unrealized appreciation and depreciation on control and affiliate investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We did not hold any Control investments at September 30, 2015.  

75 

In June   2016 our investm  ents in SkyCross, Inc. became classified as a control investment as a result of obtaining more than 50% representation on th  e portfolio company s board. I  n June 2016   we   also   acquired   100%   ownership   of the equity of Achilles Technology Management Co II, Inc  . and classified it as a control investment in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act.   In June 2016  , Achilles   Technology Management Co II, Inc. acquired the assets of a global antenna company that produces radio frequency system solutions as part   of an article 9 consensual foreclosure and public auction for total consideration in the amount of $4  .0   million.   In September   2016   we   made   a   $1.0 million   debt investment in Achilles Technology Management II to provide working capital under the terms of a   loan servicing agreement.   Our   investments in Achilles Technology Management Co II, Inc. are carried on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities at fair value.  
 As of December 31, 2015, changes to the capitalization structure of the portfolio company Gelesis, Inc. reduced our investment below the threshold for classification as an affiliate investment. 
 Portfolio Grading  
 We use an investment grading system, which grades each debt investment on a scale of 1 to 5 to characterize and monitor our expected level of risk on the debt investments in our portfolio with 1 being the highest quality. The following table shows the distribution of our outstanding debt investments on the 1 to 5 investment grading scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:  

As of September 30, 2016, our debt investments had a weighted average investment grading of 2.32, as compared to 2.16 at December 31, 2015. Our policy is to lower the grading on our portfolio companies as they approach the point in time when they will require additional equity capital. Additionally, we may downgrade our portfolio companies if they are not meeting our financing criteria or are underperforming relative to their respective business plans. Various companies in our portfolio will require additional funding in the near term or have not met their business plans and therefore have been downgraded until their funding is complete or their operations improve.  
 The decline in weighted average investment grading at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the net increase of rated 3 portfolio companies due to underperformance or near term funding requirements. This decline is partially offset by a net reduction in the number of rated 5 companies due to performance improvements or settlement of positions that were rated 5 at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a net of twenty existing portfolio companies were downgraded to a 3 rating.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a net of three portfolio companies were upgraded that were rated 5 at December 31, 2015.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had six debt investments on non-accrual with a cumulative investment cost and fair value of approximately $46.2 million and $9.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had five debt investments on non-accrual with cumulative investment cost and fair value of approximately $47.4 million and $23.2 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had one debt investment with an investment cost and fair value of approximately $20.1 million and $14.9 million, respectively, for which only the PIK interest was on non-accrual. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a realized loss of approximately $6.2 million on the settlement of one debt investment that was on non-accrual at December 31, 2015.  In addition, we recognized realized losses of $419,000 and $430,000 on the liquidation and partial write off, respectively, of two debt investments that were on non-accrual as of December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations   
 Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 Investment Income  
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $45.1 million as compared to approximately $47.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $127.6 million as compared to approximately $117.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $40.0 million as compared to approximately $40.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $116.1 million as compared to approximately $106.1 million for nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the acceleration of interest income due to early loan repayments, offset by an increase in interest income related to the weighted average balance of principal outstanding on our debt investments. The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to debt investment portfolio growth, specifically an increase in the weighted average principal outstanding between the periods. 
 Of the $40.0 million in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $38.2 million represents recurring income from the contractual servicing of our loan portfolio and approximately $1.8 million represents income related to the acceleration of income due to early loan repayments and other one-time events during the period. Income from recurring interest and the acceleration of interest income due to early loan repayments represented $34.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of the $40.3 million interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Of the $116.1 million in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $111.8 million represents recurring income from the contractual servicing of our loan portfolio and approximately $4.3 million represents income related to the acceleration of income due to early loan repayments and other one-time events during the period. Income from recurring interest and the acceleration of interest income due to early loan repayments represented $100.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively, of the $106.1 million interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Income from commitment, facility and loan related fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $5.1 million as compared to approximately $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Income from commitment, facility and loan related fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $11.5 million as compared to approximately $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the acceleration of unamortized fees due to early repayments and one-time fees between periods.    
 Of the $5.1 million in income from commitment, facility and loan related fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $2.5 million represents income from recurring fee amortization and approximately $2.6 million represents income related to the acceleration of unamortized fees due to early repayments and one-time fees for the period.  Income from recurring fee amortization and the acceleration of unamortized fees due to early loan repayments represented $1.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of the $6.8 million income for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Of the $11.5 million in income from commitment, facility and loan related fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $7.2 million represents income from recurring fee amortization and approximately $4.3 million represents income related to the acceleration of unamortized fees due to early repayments and one-time fees for the period.  Income from recurring fee amortization and the acceleration of unamortized fees due to early loan repayments represented $5.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of the $11.6 million income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 77 

The following table shows the PIK-related activity for the nine months   ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, at cost:   

The increase in PIK interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is due to an increase in the weighted average principal outstanding of loans which bear PIK interest. The increase is primarily due to new originations and compounding interest, along with a decrease in the number of PIK loans which paid off during the period. 
 In certain investment transactions, we may earn income from advisory services; however, we had no income from advisory services in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 
 Operating Expenses  
 Our operating expenses are comprised of interest and fees on our borrowings, general and administrative expenses and employee compensation and benefits. Our operating expenses totaled approximately $21.3 million and $23.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our operating expenses totaled approximately $60.4 million and $64.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, receptively. 
 Interest and Fees on our Borrowings  
 Interest and fees on our borrowings totaled approximately $10.1 million and $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and approximately $27.0 million and $27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest and fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to September 30, 2015 increased due to higher weighted average principal balances outstanding on our 2024 Notes along with higher debt issuance cost amortization on our Asset Backed Notes, offset by a reduction in interest expense on our credit facilities and Convertible Notes. The slight decrease in interest and fee expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to September 30, 2015 was attributable to the payoff of our Convertible Notes, 2017 Asset Backed Notes and a reduction in the weighted average principal balance outstanding on our Credit Facilities between periods. 
 We had a weighted average cost of debt, comprised of interest and fees and loss on debt extinguishment (long-term liabilities   convertible senior notes), of approximately 6.0% and 5.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a weighted average cost of debt of approximately 5.8% and 5.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the weighted average cost of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the acceleration of unamortized fee expense related to pay downs on our Asset Backed Notes, and the incremental issuance of our 2024 Notes in the prior period. The decrease between the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by a reduction in the weighted average principal outstanding on our higher yielding debt instruments compared to the prior period, specifically due to redemptions of our 2019 Notes and Convertible Notes, offset by the incremental issuance of our 2024 Notes. 
 General and Administrative Expenses  
 General and administrative expenses include legal fees, consulting fees, accounting fees, printer fees, insurance premiums, rent, expenses associated with the workout of underperforming investments and various other expenses. Our general and administrative expenses decreased to $4.1 million from $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $12.1 million from $12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a reduction in costs related to strategic hiring objectives, slightly offset by an increase in corporate legal and other expenses between periods. 
   
 78 

Employee Compensation   
 Employee compensation and benefits totaled $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three and nine-month comparative period was primarily due to changes in variable compensation expenses related to general and originator performance factors. 
 Employee stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease between both comparative periods was primarily related to restricted stock award vesting, specifically the final vesting of retention grants issued in 2014. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Convertible Senior Notes 
 Our Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016. Throughout the life of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of approximately $74.8 million of our Convertible Senior Notes exercised their conversion rights. These Convertible Senior Notes were settled with a combination of cash equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes and approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock, or $24.3 million.  
 We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt for the proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount. The loss was partially offset by a gain in the amount of the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the converted notes and the fair value of the debt instrument. The net loss on extinguishment of debt we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,000.  We did not record a loss on extinguishment of debt in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The loss on extinguishment of debt was classified as a component of net investment income in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Net Investment Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation  
 Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of an investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.  
 A summary of realized gains and losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized net realized gains of $7.9 and $6.4 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded gross realized gains of $9.4 million primarily from the sale or acquisition of our holdings in three portfolio companies, including Box, Inc. ($7.8 million), Touchcommerce, Inc. ($698,000), and ReachLocal ($610,000). These gains were offset by gross realized losses of $1.5 million primarily from the write off of our warrant and equity investments in one portfolio company and our debt investment in one portfolio company. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded gross realized gains of $6.8 million primarily from the sale of investments in three portfolio companies, including Box, Inc. ($2.7 million), Atrenta, Inc. ($2.6 million), and Egalet Corporation ($652,000), and approximately $871,000 from subsequent recoveries received on two previously written-off debt investments. These gains were offset by gross realized losses of $424,000 from the liquidation of our investments in one portfolio company.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized net realized gains of $3.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded gross realized gains of $13.6 million primarily from the sale or acquisition of our investments in five portfolio companies, including Box, Inc. ($8.9 million), Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ($1.5 million), Ping Identity Corporation ($1.3 million), Touchcommerce, Inc. ($698,000) and ReachLocal ($610,000). These gains were offset by gross realized losses of $10.2 million primarily from the liquidation or write off of our warrant and equity investments in six portfolio companies and of our debt investments in four portfolio companies, including the settlement of our outstanding debt investment in The Neat Company ($6.2 million). 
 79 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we recorded gross realized gains of $11.6 million primarily from the sale of investments in seven portfolio companies,   including Box, Inc. ($2.7 million), Atrenta, Inc. ($2.6 million),     Cempra,   Inc. ($2.0 million), Celladon Corporation ($1.4 million), Egalet Corporation ($652,000), Everyday Health, Inc. ($387,000) and Identiv,   Inc. ($304,000).   These gains were partially offset by gross realized losses of $3.2 million from the liquidation of our i  nvestments in nine portfolio companies.  
 The net unrealized appreciation and depreciation of our investments is based on the fair value of each investment determined in good faith by our board of directors ( Board of Directors ). The following table summarizes the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $834,000 of net unrealized depreciation, of which $1.0 million was net unrealized depreciation from our debt, equity and warrant investments. Approximately $7.7 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our debt investments related to $14.1 million of unrealized depreciation for collateral based impairments on eleven portfolio companies offset by the reversal of $1.3 million of unrealized depreciation for prior period collateral based impairments on one portfolio company and $4.8 million of unrealized appreciation from our current market yield analysis related to industry performance. This net unrealized depreciation was partially offset by approximately $4.0 million of net unrealized appreciation on our equity investments, which primarily relates to $6.5 million of unrealized appreciation on our public equity portfolio and $2.3 million of unrealized appreciation on our private portfolio companies related to portfolio company performance, offset by the reversal of approximately $4.7 million of net unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain on sales of Box, Inc. An additional $2.7 million of net unrealized appreciation on our warrant investments was primarily due to $5.8 million of unrealized appreciation on our private portfolio companies related to portfolio company performance offset by the reversal of approximately $2.0 million of unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain due to the acquisition of our warrant investments in two portfolio companies.  
 Net unrealized depreciation was further offset by $217,000 as a result of decreased estimated taxes payable for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Net unrealized depreciation increased by $34,000 as a result of net depreciation of fair value on the pool of warrants collateralized under the warrant participation agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded approximately $25.9 million of net unrealized depreciation, of which $26.1 million was net unrealized depreciation from our debt, equity and warrant investments. Approximately $18.1 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our equity investments which primarily related to $9.8 million of unrealized depreciation on our public equity portfolio with the largest concentration in our investment in Box, Inc., $3.8 million of unrealized depreciation on our private portfolio companies related to declining industry performance, and the reversal of $4.5 million of unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain on sale of Box, Inc. and the acquisition proceeds received from Atrenta, Inc. Approximately $9.4 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our warrant investments which primarily related to approximately $2.1 million of unrealized depreciation on our public warrant portfolio related to portfolio company performance and $6.1 million of unrealized depreciation on our private portfolio companies related to declining industry performance. This net unrealized depreciation was partially offset by approximately $1.4 million of net unrealized appreciation on our debt investments which primarily related to the reversal of $3.1 million of unrealized depreciation on a previous collateral based impairment offset by $1.0 million of unrealized depreciation for collateral based impairments on twelve portfolio companies. 
 Net unrealized depreciation was offset by $63,000 as a result of decreased estimated taxes payable for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Net unrealized depreciation was further offset by $69,000 as a result of net depreciation of fair value on the pool of warrants collateralized under the warrant participation agreement and as a result of the acquisition proceeds we received on our Atrenta, Inc. equity, which was exercised from warrants subject to the agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

The following table summarizes the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in the investment portfolio by category, excluding net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on taxes payable, escrow receivables and Citigroup warrant participation,   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

*   
 
 Level 1 assets are generally equities listed in active markets and level 2 assets are generally warrants held in a public company. Observable market prices are typically the primary input in valuing level 1 and 2 assets. Level 3 asset valuations require inputs that are both significant and unobservable. Generally, level 3 assets are debt investments and warrants and equities held in a private company. See Note 2 to the financial statements discussing ASC Topic 820 ( Fair Value Measurements ).     

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $16.1 million of net unrealized depreciation, of which $15.9 million was net unrealized depreciation from our debt, equity and warrant investments. Approximately $9.7 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our debt investments which was primarily related to $34.7 million of unrealized depreciation for collateral based impairments on eleven portfolio companies offset by the reversal of $12.5 million of unrealized depreciation upon payoff or settling of our debt investments and the reversal of $7.0 million of unrealized depreciation for prior period collateral based impairments on five portfolio companies. Approximately $8.5 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our equity investments which primarily relates to $3.9 million of unrealized depreciation on our public equity portfolio with the largest concentration in our investment in Box, Inc. and the reversal of $4.6 million of net unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain on sales of Box, Inc. and the write off of three portfolio company investments. This unrealized depreciation was partially offset by approximately $2.3 million of net unrealized appreciation on our warrant investments primarily related to $5.4 million of net unrealized appreciation on our private portfolio companies related to portfolio company performance offset by the reversal of approximately $1.2 million of unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain due to the acquisition of our warrant investments in two portfolio companies and the write off of five portfolio company investments. 
 Net unrealized depreciation increased by $78,000 as a result of increased estimated taxes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Net unrealized appreciation was further increased by $3,000 as a result of net depreciation of fair value on the pool of warrants collateralized under the warrant participation agreement and a decrease in the liability for the acquisition proceeds received on our Ping Identity Corporation equity investment, which had been exercised from warrants that were included in the collateral pool, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 81 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded approximately $33.0 million of net unrealized depreciation, of which $33.8 million was net unrealized depreciation from our debt, equity and warrant investments. Approximately $3.5 million was attributed to   net unrealized depreciation on our debt investments which was primarily related to $10.2 million   of   unrealized depreciation for collateral based impairments on twelve portfolio companies offset by the reversal of $5.6 million   of   unrealized   de  preciation fo  r prior period collateral based impairments on three portfolio companies. Approximately $22.8 million was attributed to net unrealized depreciation on our equity investm  ents which primarily related to approximately $11.9 million   of   unrealized depreciation   on our public equity portfolio with the largest concentration in our investment in Box, Inc. and the reversal   of $8.2   million of prior period net unrealized appreciation upon being realized as a gain for our sale of shares of Box, Inc., Cempra, Inc. Cellad  on Corporation, Everyday Health, and Identiv, Inc. as discussed above. Finally   approximately $7.5 million   is attributed to net   unrealized depreciation on our warrant investments which   primarily related to   $7.4   million of unrealized depreciation on our private portfolio companies related to declining industry performance.  
 Net unrealized depreciation was offset by $660,000 as a result of decreased estimated taxes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Net unrealized depreciation was further offset by $62,000 as a result of net depreciation of fair value on the pool of warrants collateralized under the warrant participation as a result of the acquisition proceeds we received on our Atrenta, Inc. equity, which was exercised from warrants subject to the agreement during nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 The following table summarizes the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in the investment portfolio by category, excluding net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on taxes payable, escrow receivables and Citigroup warrant participation, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

 Level 1 assets are generally equities listed in active markets and level 2 assets are generally warrants held in a public company. Observable market prices are typically the primary input in valuing level 1 and 2 assets. Level 3 asset valuations require inputs that are both significant and unobservable. Generally, level 3 assets are debt investments and warrants and equities held in a private company. See Note 2 to the financial statements discussing ASC Topic 820 ( Fair Value Measurements ).     

 Income and Excise Taxes  
 We account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Topic 740 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ( ASC ),  Income Taxes , under which income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred based upon the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax law. Valuation allowances may be used to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount likely to be realized. Based upon our previous election and anticipated continued qualification to be subject to taxation as a RIC, we are typically not subject to a material level of federal income taxes. We intend to distribute approximately $8.2 million of spillover earnings from ordinary income from the year ended December 31, 2015 to our stockholders in 2016.

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations and Earnings Per Share   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled approximately $30.8 million and approximately $4.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled approximately $54.6 million and approximately $28.7 million, respectively. 
 Both the basic and fully diluted net change in net assets per common share were $0.41 per share and $0.74 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and both the basic and fully diluted net change in net assets per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0.05 per share and $0.40 per share, respectively. 
 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the dilutive effect of the Convertible Senior Notes under the treasury stock method was included in this calculation as our share price was greater than the conversion price in effect ($11.12 as of September 30, 2015) for the Convertible Senior Notes for such periods. The Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016, as such there is no potential additional dilutive effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources  
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived from our Credit Facilities, SBA debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration,  At-The-Market , or ATM, and private offerings of securities, by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowing, including from the SBA through our SBIC subsidiaries.  
 On August 16, 2013, we entered into an ATM equity distribution agreement (the  Equity Distribution Agreement ) with JMP Securities LLC ( JMP ) and on March 7, 2016 we renewed the Equity Distribution Agreement. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that we may offer and sell up to 8.0 million shares of our common stock from time to time through JMP, as our sales agent. Sales of our common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be  at the market,  as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the  Securities Act ) including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) or similar securities exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 we sold 2.1 million and 4.1 million shares of common stock for total accumulated net proceeds of approximately $26.5 million and $50.2 million, respectively, including $986,000 and $1.8 million of offering expenses, respectively. We did not sell any shares under the program during the year ended December 31, 2015. We generally use the net proceeds from these offerings to make investments, repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 3.2 million shares remained available for issuance and sale under the ATM. See    Subsequent Events.  
 On February 24, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan permitting us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. This plan expired on August 24, 2015. On August 27, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a replacement stock repurchase plan permitting us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock and on February 17, 2016, our Board of Directors extended the program until August 23, 2016, after which the plan expired. During nine months ended September 30, 2016 we repurchased 449,588 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $10.64 per share and a total cost of approximately $4.8 million. We did not make any repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  See  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  for further information on the repurchases made during the period. 
 At the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on July 7, 2015, our common stockholders approved a proposal to allow us to issue common stock at a discount from our then current net asset value ( NAV ) per share,  which was effective until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders on July 7, 2016. Such authorization was not sought at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 we did not issue common stock at a discount to NAV.   
 Our Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016. Throughout the life of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of approximately $74.8 million of our Convertible Senior Notes exercised their conversion rights. These Convertible Senior Notes were settled with a combination of cash equal to the outstanding principal amount of the converted notes and approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock, or $24.3 million.  
 83 

On May 2,   2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of an additional $72.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% unsecured notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes ). The $72.9 million in aggregate principal amount includes $65.4 million from the initial   offering on April 21, 2016 and $7.5 million as a result of underwriters exercising a portion of their option to purchase up to an additional $9.8 million in aggregate principal to cover overallotments on April 29, 2016.   
 On May 5, 2016, we, through a special purpose wholly-owned subsidiary, Hercules Funding III, as borrower, entered into the credit facility (the  Union Bank Facility ) with MUFG Union Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party to the Union Bank Facility from time to time. The Union Bank Facility replaced our credit facility (the  Prior Union Bank Facility ) entered into on August 14, 2014 (as amended and restated from time to time) with MUFG Union Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party to the Prior Union Bank Facility from time to time.  Any references to amounts related to the Union Bank Facility prior to May 5, 2016 were incurred and relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility. 
 On June 27, 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of an additional $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. On June 30, 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase up to an additional $9.0 million in aggregate principal to cover overallotments, resulting in total aggregate principal of $69.0 million from the offering. The 2024 Notes rank equally in right of payment and form a single series of notes. The 2024 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per year payable quarterly on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30, of each year, beginning July 30, 2016. We intend to invest the net proceeds of these public offerings to fund investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with its investment objective and for other general corporate purposes.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had $110.4 million of 2019 Notes, $244.9 million of 2024 Notes, $117.0 million of 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and $190.2 million of SBA debentures payable. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Wells Facility or the Union Bank Facility. See    Subsequent Events.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had $264.0 million in available liquidity, including $69.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. We had available borrowing capacity of approximately $120.0 million under the Wells Facility after the March 2016 expansion of the available facility to $120.0 million and we had available borrowing capacity of $75.0 million under the Union Bank Facility, both subject to existing terms and advance rates and regulatory requirements. We primarily invest cash on hand in interest bearing deposit accounts.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had $118.5 million of capital outstanding in restricted accounts related to our SBIC that we may use to fund new investments in the SBIC. With our net investments of $44.0 million and $74.5 million in HT II and HT III, respectively, we have the combined capacity to issue a total of $190.2 million of SBA guaranteed debentures, subject to SBA approval. At September 30, 2016, we have issued $190.2 million in SBA guaranteed debentures in our SBIC subsidiaries.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $9.0 million of restricted cash, which consists of collections of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized. In accordance with the terms of the related securitized 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, based on current characteristics of the securitized debt investment portfolios, the restricted funds may be used to pay monthly interest and principal on the securitized debt and are not distributed to us or available for our general operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we principally funded our operations from (i) cash receipts from interest, dividend and fee income from our investment portfolio and (ii) cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of debt investments and the sale of debt and equity investments.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating activities used $58.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $78.5 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This $20.0 million decrease in cash used by operating activities is primarily related to a decrease in investment purchases of approximately $70.3 million offset by a decrease in investment repayments of $38.7 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our investing activities used approximately $16,000 of cash, compared to approximately $7.1 million provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This $7.2 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a reduction of approximately $7.1 million in cash, classified as restricted cash, on assets that are securitized.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our financing activities provided $32.3 million of cash, compared to $8.4 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $40.7 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of $141.9 million of 2024 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock of $49.9 million and in repayments on our credit facilities.  
 84 

As of September 30, 2016, net   assets totaled   $753.6   million, with a NAV per share of   $9.86  . We intend to   continue to operate so as to generate   cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. Our primary use of funds will be investments   in portfolio companies and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.   
 As required by the 1940 Act, our asset coverage must be at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. As of September 30, 2016 our asset coverage ratio under our regulatory requirements as a business development company was 259.6% excluding our SBA debentures as a result of our exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to exclude all SBA leverage from our asset coverage ratio. As a result of the SEC exemptive order, our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 200%, which while providing increased investment flexibility, also may increase our exposure to risks associated with leverage. Total leverage when including our SBA debentures was 213.7% at September 30, 2016. 
 Outstanding Borrowings  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had the following available borrowings and outstanding amounts:  

(1)   
 
 Except for the Wells Facility and Union Bank Facility, all carrying values represent the principal amount outstanding less the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and unaccreted discount, if any, associated with the loan as of the balance sheet date. See below for the amount of debt issuance cost associated with each borrowing.     

(3)   
 
 The Convertible Senior Notes were fully settled on or before their contractual maturity date of April 15, 2016.    

(4)   
 
 Availability subject to us meeting the borrowing base requirements. As the Union Bank Facility was replaced on May 5, 2016, amounts included above prior to May 5, 2016 relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility.    

 Debt issuance costs are fees and other direct incremental costs we incur in obtaining debt financing and are recognized as prepaid expenses and amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the effective yield method or the straight line method, which closely approximates the effective yield method. In accordance with ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction to the associated liability balance on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities, except for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

(1)   
 
 As the Wells Facility and Union Bank Facility are line-of-credit arrangements, the debt issuance costs associated with these instruments are presented separately as an asset on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities in accordance with ASU 2015-15. As the Union Bank Facility was replaced on May 5, 2016, amounts included above prior to May 5, 2016 relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility.    

85 

As of January 1, 2016, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs    and ASU 2015-15    Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ,   which require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, except for debt   issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements.   Adoption of these standards results in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from Other Assets and the presentation of our SBA Debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, an  d Convertible Senior Notes net of the associated debt issuance costs for each instrument in the liabilities section on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. There is no impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, there   is no change to the presentation of the Wells Facility or Union Bank Facility as debt issuance costs are presented separately as an asset on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  Refer to    Critical Accounting Policies .  
 Refer to  Note 4   Borrowings  included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for a discussion of the contract terms, interest expense, and fees associated with each outstanding borrowing as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Commitments  
 In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded contractual commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded contractual commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded contractual commitments may be significant from time to time. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. These commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, our disclosure of unfunded contractual commits includes only those which are available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $73.9 million of unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which were available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones. We intend to use cash flow from normal and early principal repayments, and proceeds from borrowings and notes to fund these commitments. 
 We also had approximately $100.0 million of non-binding term sheets outstanding to three new and existing companies, which generally convert to contractual commitments within approximately 90 days of signing. Non-binding outstanding term sheets are subject to completion of our due diligence and final investment committee approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio companies. Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
 The fair value of our unfunded commitments are considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding, given that interest rates are generally pegged to a market indices and given the existence of milestones, conditions and/or obligations imbedded in the borrowing agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2016, our unfunded contractual commitments available at the request of the portfolio company, including undrawn revolving facilities, and unencumbered by milestones are as follows: 

(1)   
 
   Amount represents unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which are available at the request of the portfolio company. Amount excludes unfunded commitments which are unavailable due to the borrower having not met certain milestones.       

 86 

Contractual Obligations      

 The following table shows our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:  

(1)   
 
 Excludes commitments to extend credit to our portfolio companies.     

(2)   
 
 We also have a warrant participation agreement with Citigroup. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.     

(4)   
 
 Amounts represent future principal repayments and not the carrying value of each liability. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.    

(5)   
 
 Long-term facility leases.     

 Certain premises are leased under agreements which expire at various dates through March 2020. Total rent expense amounted to approximately $420,000 and $1.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Total rent expense amounted to approximately $414,000 and $1.2 million during the same periods ended September 30, 2015.  
 Indemnification Agreements 
 We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors. The indemnification agreements are intended to provide our directors the maximum indemnification permitted under Maryland law and the 1940 Act. Each indemnification agreement provides that we shall indemnify the director who is a party to the agreement, or an  Indemnitee,  including the advancement of legal expenses, if, by reason of his or her corporate status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to or a witness in any threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and the 1940 Act. 
 We and our executives and directors are covered by Directors and Officers Insurance, with the directors and officers being indemnified by us to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law subject to the restrictions in the 1940 Act.

Dividend Distributions  
 The following table summarizes our dividend distributions declared and paid, to be paid, or reinvested on all shares, including restricted stock, to date:  

*   
 
 Dividend distribution paid in cash and stock.     

 88 

On   October 26, 2016 the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend distribution of $0.31 per share to be paid on November 21, 2016 to stockholders of record as of November 14, 2016. This distribution represents our forty-fifth consecutive dividend declaratio  n since our initial public offering, bringing the total cumulative dividend declared to date $12.47 per share.  
 Our Board of Directors maintains a variable dividend distribution policy with the objective of distributing four quarterly distributions in an amount that approximates 90 - 100% of our taxable quarterly income or potential annual income for a particular taxable year. In addition, at the end of our taxable year, our Board of Directors may choose to pay an additional special dividend distribution, or fifth dividend, so that we may distribute approximately all of our annual taxable income in the taxable year in which it was earned, or may elect to maintain the option to spill over our excess taxable income into the following taxable year as part of any future dividend distribution payments. 
 Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would generally be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of a stockholder s tax basis in our shares, and any distributions paid in excess of a stockholder s tax basis in our shares would be treated as a capital gain. The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made annually as of the end of our taxable year and is generally based upon our taxable income for the full taxable year and distributions paid for the full taxable year. As a result, any determination of the tax attributes of our distributions made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full taxable year. Of the dividend distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2015, 100% were distributions derived from our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we declared a distribution of $0.31 per share. If we had determined the tax attributes of our distributions year-to-date as of September 30, 2016, 100% would be from our current and accumulated earnings and profits. However, there can be no certainty to stockholders that this determination is representative of what the tax attributes of our 2016 distributions to stockholders will actually be.  
 Shortly after the close of each calendar year information identifying the source of the distribution (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of paid-in-capital surplus which is a nontaxable distribution, if any) will be provided to our stockholders subject to information reporting. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to our stockholders.  
 We expect to qualify to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset composition tests, as well as distribute dividends to our stockholders each taxable year of an amount at least equal to 90% of the sum of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, and our net tax-exempt income, if any. Upon being eligible to be subject to tax as a RIC, we would be entitled to deduct dividend distributions we pay to our stockholders in determining the overall components of our  taxable income.  Components of our taxable income include our taxable interest, dividend and fee income, reduced by certain deductions, as well as taxable net realized securities gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. In connection with maintaining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, we have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders each taxable year, which generally should relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 As a RIC, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income and gains unless we distribute dividends in respect of each calendar year  in a timely manner to our stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the 1-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. We will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income tax (such as retained net capital gains).  
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, we may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable year dividend distributions from such taxable income into the next taxable year and pay a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution as dividend distributions in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of dividend distributions paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent we choose to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, dividends declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from our taxable income for that taxable year as such dividend distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.  
 We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. Our ability to make distributions will be limited by the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.  
 89 

We intend to distribute approximately $8.2 million of spillover earnings from ordinary income from the year ended December 31, 2015 to our stockho  lders in 2016.   
 We maintain an  opt-out  dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend distribution, cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless the stockholder specifically  opts out  of the dividend reinvestment plan and chooses to receive cash dividend distributions.  
 Critical Accounting Policies  
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.  
 Reclassification 
   Certain balances from prior years have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.  
 Change in Accounting Principle 
   As of January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and ASU 2015-15  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which collectively require debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, except for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements.  Adoption of these standards results in the reclassification of debt issuance costs from Other Assets and the presentation of our SBA Debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and Convertible Senior Notes net of the associated debt issuance costs for each instrument in the liabilities section on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the comparative Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2015 has been adjusted to apply the change in accounting principle retrospectively. Specifically, the presentation of our Other Assets, SBA Debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, and Convertible Senior Notes line items were adjusted by the amount of unamortized debt issuance costs for each instrument. There is no impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  In addition, there is no change to the presentation of the Wells Facility or Union Facility as debt issuance costs are presented separately as an asset on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Refer to    Outstanding Borrowings  for the amount of unamortized debt issuance costs for each instrument.  
 Valuation of Investments  
 The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded.  
 At September 30, 2016, approximately 93.0% of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820. Our debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of our investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. As such, we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy by our Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.  
 We may from time to time engage an independent valuation firm to provide us with valuation assistance with respect to certain of our portfolio investments. We engage independent valuation firms on a discretionary basis. Specifically, on a quarterly basis, we will identify portfolio investments with respect to which an independent valuation firm will assist in valuing. We select these portfolio investments based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the potential for material fluctuations in valuation results, credit quality and the time lapse since the last valuation of the portfolio investment by an independent valuation firm. 
   
 90 

We intend to continue to engage an independent valuation firm to provide us with assistance regarding our determination of the fair value of selected portfolio investments   each quarter unless directed by the Board of Directors to cancel such valuation services. The scope of the services rendered by an independent valuation firm is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is ultimately, and solely,   responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith.   
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:  
 (1) our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;  
 (2) preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and business based assumptions are discussed with our investment committee;  
 (3) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuation of the investments in the portfolio company as provided by the investment committee, which incorporates the results of the independent valuation firm as appropriate; and  
 (4) the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of, where applicable, the respective independent valuation firm and the investment committee.  
 ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. ASC Topic 820 also requires disclosure for fair value measurements based on the level within the hierarchy of the information used in the valuation. ASC Topic 820 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
 We have categorized all investments recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC Topic 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:  
 Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are equities listed in active markets.  
 Level 2 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset in connection with market data at the measurement date and for the extent of the instrument s anticipated life. Fair valued assets that are generally included in this category are publically held debt investments and warrants held in a public company.  
 Level 3 Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset at the measurement date. It includes prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Generally, assets carried at fair value and included in this category are the debt investments and warrants and equities held in a private company.  
   
 91 

Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categoriz  ed in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015. We transfer investments   in and out of Level 1, 2 and 3   as of the beginning balance sheet date, based on changes   in the use of observable and unobservable inputs utilized to perform the valuation for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no   transfers between Levels 1 or 2.  

The table below presents a reconciliation for all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, 
 excluding accrued interest components, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.

For nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $315,000   in net unrealized appreciation   and $590,000 in net unrealized depreciation   was recorded for preferred stock and common stock Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date. For the same period, approximately   $22.8   million   in net unrealized depreciation   and $3.5   million in net unrealized app  reciation   was recorded for debt and warrant Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date.  
   
 For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $179,000  in net unrealized depreciation and $745,000 in net unrealized appreciation was recorded for preferred stock and common stock Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date. For the same period, approximately $13.7 million and $5.9 million in net unrealized depreciation was recorded for debt and warrant Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date. 
 The following tables provides quantitative information about our Level 3 fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the table below, according to our valuation policy we may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining our fair value measurements. The tables below are not intended to be all-inclusive, but rather provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to our fair value measurements.  
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our escrow receivables is the amount recoverable at the contractual maturity date of the escrow receivable. 

(a)   
 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our debt securities are hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts). The hypothetical market yield is defined as the exit price of an investment in a hypothetical market to hypothetical market participants where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The premiums (discounts) relate to company specific characteristics such as underlying investment performance, security liens, and other characteristics of the investment. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. Debt investments in the industries noted in our Consolidated Schedule of Investments are included in the industries noted above as follows:     

Pharmaceuticals, above, is comprised of debt investments in the Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Drug Discovery and Development, Drug Delivery and Biotechnology Tools industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.      

Technology, above, is comprised of debt investments in the Software, Semiconductors, Internet Consumer and Business Services, Consumer and Business Products, Information Services, and Communications and Networking industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.      

Sustainable and Renewable Technology, above, aligns with the Sustainable and Renewable Technology Industry in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.      

Medical Devices, above, is comprised of debt investments in the Surgical Devices and Medical Devices and Equipment industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.

94 

(a)   
 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our warrant and equity-related securities are revenue and/or EBITDA multiples and discounts for lack of marketability. Additional inputs used in the Black Scholes option pricing model ("OPM ) include industry volatility, risk free interest rate and estimated time to exit. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation may result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. For some investments, additional consideration may be given to data from the last round of financing or merger/acquisition events near the measurement date.

Debt Investments     
 We follow the guidance set forth in ASC Topic 820 which establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. Our debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related markets including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of our investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for debt instruments for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. In addition, we may, from time to time, invest in public debt of companies that meet our investment objectives. These investments are considered Level 2 assets. 
 In making a good faith determination of the value of our investments, we generally start with the cost basis of the investment, which includes the value attributed to the OID, if any, and PIK interest or other receivables which have been accrued as earned. We then apply the valuation methods as set forth below.  
 We apply a procedure for debt investments that assumes the sale of each investment in a hypothetical market to a hypothetical market participant where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The hypothetical market does not include scenarios where the underlying security was simply repaid or extinguished, but includes an exit concept. We determine the yield at inception for each debt investment. We then use senior secured, leveraged loan yields provided by third party providers to determine the change in market yields between inception of the debt security and the measurement date. Industry specific indices and other relevant market data are used to benchmark/assess market based movements.  
 Under this process, we also evaluate the collateral for recoverability of the debt investments. We consider each portfolio company s credit rating, security liens and other characteristics of the investment to adjust the baseline yield to derive a credit adjusted hypothetical yield for each investment as of the measurement date. The anticipated future cash flows from each investment are then discounted at the hypothetical yield to estimate each investment s fair value as of the measurement date.  
 Our process includes, among other things, the underlying investment performance, the current portfolio company s financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation, estimated remaining life, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. We value our syndicated debt investments using broker quotes and bond indices amongst other factors. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a debt investment, we may consider other factors than those a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value, including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis.  
 We record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has decreased in value, including where collection of a debt investment is doubtful or, if under the in-exchange premise, when the value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost of the investment. Conversely, where appropriate, we record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, that our investment has also appreciated in value or, if under the in-exchange premise, the value of a debt security is greater than amortized cost.  
 When originating a debt instrument, we generally receive warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower. We determine the cost basis of the warrants or other equity-related securities received based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants or other equity-related securities received. Any resulting discount on the debt investment from recordation of the warrant or other equity instruments is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.  
 Debt investments that are traded on a public exchange are valued at the prevailing market price at period end. 
  Equity-Related Securities and Warrants   
 Securities that are traded in the over-the-counter markets or on a stock exchange will be valued at the prevailing bid price at period end. We have a limited amount of equity securities in public companies. In accordance with the 1940 Act, unrestricted publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the measurement date.  
 We estimate the fair value of warrants using a Black Scholes OPM. At each reporting date, privately held warrant and equity related securities are valued based on an analysis of various factors including, but not limited to, the portfolio company s operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions, price to enterprise value or price to equity ratios, discounted cash flow, valuation comparisons to comparable public companies or other industry benchmarks. When an external event occurs, such as a purchase transaction, public offering, or subsequent equity sale, the pricing indicated by that external event is utilized to corroborate our valuation of the warrant and equity related securities. We periodically review the valuation of our portfolio companies that have not been involved in a qualifying external event to determine if the enterprise value of the portfolio company may have increased or decreased since the last valuation measurement date.  
   
 96 

Escrow Receivables  
 Escrow receivables are collected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement. Escrow balances are typically distributed over a period greater than one year and may accrue interest during the escrow period. Escrow balances are measured for collectability on at least a quarterly basis and fair value is determined based on the amount of the estimated recoverable balances and the contractual maturity date. As of June 30, 2016 there were no material past due escrow receivables. 
 Income Recognition  
 See    Changes in Portfolio  for a discussion of our income recognition policies and results during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. See    Results of Operations  for a comparison of investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 Stock-Based Compensation  
 We have issued and may, from time to time, issue additional stock options and restricted stock to employees under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and Board members under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. We follow ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  formerly known as FASB Statement 123R   Share-Based Payments   to account for stock options granted. Under ASC Topic 718, compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rate and expected option life.  
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which, among other things, requires that (i) all equity investments, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and (ii) an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Additionally, the ASU changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which, among other things, requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Additionally, the ASU requires the classification of all cash payments on leases within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which, among other things, simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which addresses eight specific cash flow issues including, among other things, the classification of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures

 We entered into a debt distribution agreement, dated October 11, 2016, pursuant to which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% notes due 2024 (the  Additional 2024 Notes ) through FBR Capital Markets   Co. acting as our sales agent (the  2024 Notes Agent ). Sales of the Additional 2024 Notes, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be  at the market offerings  as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE, or similar securities exchange or sales made through a market maker other than on an exchange at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. 
 The 2024 Notes Agent will receive a commission from us equal to up to 2.00% of the gross sales of any Additional 2024 Notes sold through the 2024 Notes Agent under the agreement. The 2024 Notes Agent is not required to sell any specific principal amount of Notes, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its sales and trading practices to sell the Additional 2024 Notes. 
 The Additional 2024 Notes offered hereby will be a further issuance of, are fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with, and form a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes initially issued by us on July 14, 2014, May 2, 2016, and June 27, 2016, respectively. The 2024 Notes will mature on July 30, 2024. We will pay interest on the Additional 2024 Notes on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on October 30, 2016. Any purchaser of the Additional 2024 Notes will pay for any interest accrued from the interest payment date preceding the issuance date of the Additional 2024 Notes up to, but excluding, the issuance date of the Additional 2024 Notes. We may redeem the 2024 Notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price set forth under the terms of the indenture. The Additional 2024 Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. 
 The Additional 2024 Notes will be our direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu, or equally in right of payment, with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by Hercules Capital, Inc. 
 The 2024 Notes are listed on the NYSE, and trade on the NYSE under the symbol  HTGX.  The Additional 2024 Notes are expected to trade  flat,  which means that purchasers in the secondary market will not pay, and sellers will not receive, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Additional 2024 Notes that is not reflected in the trading price.  
 Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and as of October 31, 2016, we sold 137,250 notes for approximately $3.5 million in aggregate principal amount. As of October 31, 2016 approximately $146.5 million in aggregate principal amount remains available for issuance and sale under the debt distribution agreement. 
 ATM Equity Program Issuances 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and as of October 31, 2016, we sold 786,000 shares of common stock for total accumulated net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million, including $107,000 of offering expenses, under our ATM equity distribution agreement with JMP. As of October 31, 2016 approximately 2.4 million shares remain available for issuance and sale under the equity distribution agreement. 
 Portfolio Company Developments  
 As of October 31, 2016, we held warrants or equity positions in four companies that have filed registration statements on Form S-1 with the SEC in contemplation of potential initial public offerings. All four companies filed confidentially under the JOBS Act. There can be no assurance that these companies will complete their initial public offerings in a timely manner or at all. In addition, subsequent to September 30, 2016 the following portfolio companies announced liquidity events: 

1.   
 
 In October 2016, Napo Pharmaceuticals, a company that focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for the global marketplace in collaboration with local partners, signed a non-binding letter-of-intent ( LOI ) to merge with our portfolio company Jaguar Animal Health, Inc.

ITEM 3.   
 
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and Prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 92.9% of the loans in our portfolio had variable rates based on floating Prime or LIBOR rates with a floor. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio.  
 Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings.  

We do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations (and foreign currency) by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against changes in interest rates (and foreign currency), they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our borrowed funds and higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we did not engage in interest rate (or foreign currency) hedging activities.  
 Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including borrowings under our Credit Facilities, SBA debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2021 Asset-Backed Notes that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments from borrowers. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. 
 Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by variable rate assets in our investment portfolio. 
 For additional information regarding the interest rate associated with each of our Credit Facilities, SBA debentures, 2019 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2021 Asset-Backed Notes, please refer to  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Outstanding Borrowings  in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 4.   
 
            CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Our chief executive and chief financial officers, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our chief executive and chief financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive and chief financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financing reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II:   OTHER INFORMATION     

ITEM 1.   
 
     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

 We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.  

ITEM  1A.   
 
     RISK FACTORS     

 In addition to the risks discussed below, important risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are described in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016.  
 Our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected.  
 Our total investment in companies may be significant individually or in the aggregate. As a result, if a significant investment in one or more companies fails to perform as expected, our financial results could be more negatively affected and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if we had made smaller investments in more companies. The following table shows the fair value of the totals of investments held in portfolio companies at September 30, 2016 that represent greater than 5% of our net assets:  

Machine Zone, Inc. is a technology company that is best known for building mobile Massively Multiplayer Online games with a focus on community-based gameplay. 
 Sungevity Development, LLC. is a global residential solar energy provider focused on making it easy and affordable for homeowners to benefit from solar power. 
   
 Actifio, Inc. is a software company that helps global enterprise customers and service provider partners virtualize their data in order to improve their data resiliency, agility, and mobility while reducing cost and operational complexity.  
 Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if these portfolio companies or any of our other significant portfolio companies encounter financial difficulty and fail to repay their obligations or to perform as expected.  
 The potential inability of our portfolio companies  in the healthcare industry to charge desired prices with respect to prescription drugs could impact their revenues and in turn their ability to repay us. 
 Some of our portfolio companies in the healthcare industry are subject to risks associated with the pricing for prescription drugs. It is uncertain whether customers of our healthcare industry portfolio companies will continue to utilize established prescription drug pricing methods, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulators have conducted investigations into the use of prescription drug pricing methods for federal program payment, and whether such methods have inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any changes to the method for calculating prescription drug costs may reduce the revenues of our portfolio companies in the healthcare industry which could in turn impair their ability to timely make any principal and interest payments owed to us. 
 We may be subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and other distributions.  
 Restrictions imposed on the declaration of dividends or other distributions to holders of our common stock, by both the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation as a RIC. While we intend to prepay our Notes and other debt to the extent necessary to enable us to distribute our income as required to maintain our ability to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation as a RIC, there can be no assurance that such actions can be effected in time to satisfy the requirements set forth in the Code.

ITEM 2.   
 
     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS     

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 110,858 shares of common stock to stockholders in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The aggregate value of the shares of our common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan was approximately $1.3 million. 
 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 On February 24, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan permitting the Company to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its common stock.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made the following repurchases pursuant to the repurchase plans. The Company did not make any repurchases pursuant to the repurchase plans during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

(1)   
 
 Note that all repurchase activity per the table above was made pursuant to the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Company s Board of Directors on February 24, 2015 and replaced on August 27, 2015 after the plan initially expired on August 24, 2015. The plan permits the Company to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its common stock, including the repurchases made on August 24, 2015. The plan expired on August 23, 2016.    

(2)
