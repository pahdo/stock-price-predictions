     Table of Contents          T-BAMM     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     AUGUST 31, 2016    Unaudited            NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN      T-Bamm was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on February 19, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. The Company is organized to sell Bamboo T-Shirts over the internet.      Going concern      To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $50,905. As at August 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $42,155. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has issued 1,000,000,000 founders shares at $0.000005 per share for net proceeds of $5,000 to the Company and private placements of 18,750,000 common shares at $0.0002 per share for net proceeds of $3,750. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.      NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation   Unaudited Financial Statements       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the six months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.      Use of Estimates and Assumptions      Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term maturities.                    7       
     Table of Contents            T-BAMM    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    AUGUST 31, 2016    Unaudited               NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)        Loss per Common Share      The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of August 31, 2016, and August 31, 2015, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.      Income Taxes      The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.       Stock-based Compensation      The Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at August 31, 2016 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.      NOTE 3   COMMON STOCK      The Company s capitalization is comprised of 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.     No common stock activity has occurred since the prior year end.      NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company received cash advances from its CEO of $20,300. Additionally, the CEO paid expenses of $1,500 on behalf of the Company. As of August 31, 2016, the total amount owing to the CEO from the Company is $42,053. The amounts due to the related party are unsecured, and non- interest bearing, with no set terms of repayment.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       This section of this Form 10-Q includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.      Results of Operations      For the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 we had no revenue. Expenses for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 totaled $14,690 resulting in a Net Loss of $14,690. The Net Loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 is a result of General and Administrative expense of $14,690 comprised primarily of professional fees and transfer agent expenses. Expenses for the comparative three month period ended August 31, 2015 totaled $4,073 resulting in a Net Loss of $4,073. The Net Loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 is a result of General and Administrative expenses of $4,073 comprised primarily of professional fees.      For the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 we had no revenue. Expenses for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 totaled $28,847 resulting in a Net Loss of $28,847. The Net Loss for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 is a result of General and Administrative expense of $28,847 comprised primarily of professional fees and transfer agent expenses. Expenses for the comparative six month period ended August 31, 2015 totaled $11,761 resulting in a Net Loss of $11,761. The Net Loss for the six month period ended August 31, 2015 is a result of General and Administrative expenses of $11,761 comprised primarily of professional fees.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our auditors have issued a  going concern  opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our sole Officer and Director, our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year.     As of August 31, 2016, we had $72 in cash as compared to $7,671 in cash at February 29, 2016. Total liabilities for the period ended August 31, 2016 were $42,227 compared to $20,979 in total liabilities at February 29, 2016. The funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the planned operations of the Company and maintain a reporting status. As of August 31, 2016 the Company owed $42,053 (February 29, 2016 $20,253) to its Chief Executive Officer. During the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company received advances from its CEO of $20,030 and $5,300 respectively. All amounts due to the related party are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have not set terms of repayment.                 9       
     Table of Contents          Off-balance sheet arrangements      Other than the situation described in the section titled Capital Recourses and Liquidity, the company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets         Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures       Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      In connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company's management, including our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that subject to the inherent limitations noted in this Part II, Item 9A(T) as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.                  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       Currently we are not involved in any pending litigation or legal proceeding.         Item 1A. Risk Factors.       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.         Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Securities and Use of Proceeds.       None         Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.       None         Item 4. Mining Safety Disclosures.       None         Item 5.
