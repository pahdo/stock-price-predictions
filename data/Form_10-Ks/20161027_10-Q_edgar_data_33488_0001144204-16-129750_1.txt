Note A   Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies 

Presentation of Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements 
  The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries for interim financial reporting
are consistent with the accounting policies followed for its annual financial reporting. All adjustments that are of a normal recurring
nature and are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported have been included
in the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements. The consolidated condensed balance sheet of the Company as of
December 26, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of that date. Certain information
and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated condensed
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company s Form 10-K annual report for 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Reclassifications    Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. These reclassifications
had no effect on net earnings. 

Note B    Seasonal Aspects 

The results of operations for the three and nine month periods
ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

Note C  
Inventories 

Note D   Equity Interest
Investments 

The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture, Stiga Sports
AB (Stiga). The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Stiga, located in Sweden, is a global sporting
goods company producing table tennis equipment, snow sleds and game products. Financial information for Stiga reflected in the
table below has been translated from local currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the respective period-end
for balance sheet amounts, and using average exchange rates for statement of operations amounts. Certain differences exist between
U.S. GAAP and local GAAP in Sweden, and the impact of these differences is not reflected in the summarized information reflected
in the table below. The most significant difference relates to the accounting for goodwill for Stiga which is amortized over eight
years in Sweden but is not amortized for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes. The goodwill for Stiga was fully amortized as of December
27, 2014. The effect on Stiga s net assets resulting from the cumulative amortization of goodwill for the periods ended October
1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are addbacks to Stiga s consolidated net assets of $10.4 million and $10.7 million, respectively.
These net differences are comprised of cumulative goodwill adjustments of $14.6 million offset by the related cumulative tax effect
of $4.2 million as of October 1, 2016 and cumulative goodwill adjustments of $14.9 million offset by the related cumulative tax
effect of $4.2 million as of October 3, 2015. The Company s 50% portion of the statement of operations impact of other individually
insignificant U.S. GAAP adjustments for the nine month periods ended October 1, 2016, and October 3, 2015 are to increase Stiga s
net income by approximately zero and $0.4 million, respectively. The Company s 50% portion of net income for Stiga, included
in equity in earnings of affiliates on the Company s statements of operations, for the three and nine month periods ended
October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 is as follows: 

Summarized financial information for Stiga Sports AB balance
sheets as of October 1, 2016, December 26, 2015, and October 3, 2015 and statements of operations for the three month and nine
month periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 is as follows: 

Note E   Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes was computed based on financial
statement income. 

Note F   Fair Values
of Financial Instruments 

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of
all financial instruments recognized in the accompanying balance sheets at amounts other than fair values. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate cost due
to the short period of time to maturity. 

Notes
Payable and Long-term Debt  

Fair values of notes payable and long-term debt approximates
the carrying value and is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms
and maturities and determined through the use of a discounted cash flow model. 

The following table presents estimated fair values of the Company s
financial instruments and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall in accordance with
FASB ASC 825 at October 1, 2016, December 26, 2015 and October 3, 2015. 

Note G   Stock Compensation 

The fair value of stock-based compensation is recognized in
accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718,  Stock Compensation . 

During the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and pursuant to
the 2007 Incentive Plan, in lieu of cash payments of director fees, the Company awarded to certain directors 13,112 shares of common
stock. During the nine months ended October 1, 2016, the Company awarded 13,250 restricted stock units to directors and 34,000
restricted stock units to employees. The restricted stock units awarded to directors time vest over two years (one-half one year
from grant date and one-half two years from grant date) provided that the director is still a director of the Company at the vest
date. Director restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture, except for termination of services as a result of retirement,
death or disability, if on the vesting date the director no longer holds a position with the Company. The 2016 restricted stock
units awarded to employees vest over four years (one-third two years from grant date, one-third three years from grant date and
one-third four years from grant date) provided that the employee is still employed by the Company and that the performance criteria
related to the market price of the Company s stock is satisfied. The criteria is for any 30 consecutive trading days on the
NASDAQ Stock Market (or such other principal securities exchange on which the Company s shares of common stock are then traded)
during the period beginning on the grant date and ending on the fourth anniversary thereof, the cumulative average Volume Weighted
Average Price per share is at least 15% higher than the closing price per share on the grant date plus any incremental dividends
paid above the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.11 per share by the Company during such four year period. The Company utilizes
the Monte Carlo technique to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted for awards with market conditions. In addition,
the Company awarded 20,000 stock options to an employee. The stock options awarded will vest over five years (one-third three years
from the grant date, one-third four years from the grant date and one-third five years from the grant date). The stock options
have an exercise price 15% higher than the closing price of a share of Escalade common stock on the grant date and are subject
to forfeiture if on the vesting date the employee is no longer employed. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing
model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. 

For the three and nine month periods ended October 1, 2016,
including expense associated with issuing certain directors stock in lieu of cash for certain director fees, the Company recognized
stock based compensation expense of ($13) thousand and $374 thousand, respectively, compared to stock based compensation expense
of $155 thousand and $478 thousand for the same periods in the prior year. At October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively,
there was $0.6 million and $0.8 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards.

Note J    Earnings
Per Share 

The shares used in computation of the Company s basic
and diluted earnings per common share are as follows: 

Stock options that are anti-dilutive as to earnings per share
and unvested restricted stock units which have a market condition for vesting that has not been achieved are ignored in the computation
of dilutive earnings per share. The number of stock options and restricted stock units that were excluded in 2016 and 2015 were
64,000 and 4,200, respectively. 

Note K   New Accounting
Standards 

With the exception of that discussed below, there have been
no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three and nine month periods ended October
1, 2016, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 26, 2015, that are of significance, or potential significance to the Company. 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The amendments in this update will increase
the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect, if
any, on its financial statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued
ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . The amendments in this update are intended to simplify
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230) . The amendments in this update address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are
presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the updated standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Note L   Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is involved in litigation arising in the normal
course of business. The Company does not believe that the disposition or ultimate resolution of existing claims or lawsuits will
have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company. 

Note M   Property, Plant
and Equipment 

During the three month periods ended October 1, 2016, the Company
sold its Wabash, Indiana land and building for a purchase price of approximately $2.1 million. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately
$1.9 million, recognized within operating income, for the three and nine month periods ended October 1, 2016. 

Note N   Acquisitions 

On January 21, 2016, the Company acquired substantially all
of the business and assets of Triumph Sports USA, Inc. s business, a brand known for its innovative lines of indoor and outdoor
games. Of the $10.0 million purchase price for the acquisition, $9.5 million was paid in cash and the remaining $0.5 million is
contingent upon the attainment of certain targets. The more significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed were comprised
of receivables ($1.4 million), inventory ($1.4 million), prepaid and other assets ($0.1 million), accounts payable ($0.6 million),
goodwill ($1.4 million) and other intangible assets ($6.3 million). 

This acquisition was not and would not
have been material to the Company s net sales, results of operations or total assets during the three and nine month periods
ended October 1, 2016. Accordingly, our consolidated results from operations do not differ materially from historical performance
as a result of this acquisition, and therefore, pro-forma results are not presented. 

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements relating to
present or future trends or factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the
impact of competitive products and pricing, product demand and market acceptance, new product development, Escalade s ability
to achieve its business objectives, especially with respect to its Sporting Goods business on which it has chosen to focus, Escalade s
ability to successfully achieve the anticipated results of strategic transactions, including the integration of the operations
of acquired assets and businesses and of divestitures of non-core assets and businesses, the continuation and development of key
customer and supplier relationships, disruptions or delays in our supply chain, Escalade s ability to control costs, general
economic conditions, fluctuation in operating results, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the securities market,
Escalade s ability to obtain financing and to maintain compliance with the terms of such financing and other risks detailed
from time to time in Escalade s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Escalade s future financial performance
could differ materially from the expectations of management contained herein. Escalade undertakes no obligation to release revisions
to these forward-looking statements after the date of this report. 

Overview  

Escalade, Incorporated (Escalade, the Company, we, us or our)
is focused on growing its Sporting Goods business through organic growth of existing categories, strategic acquisitions, and new
product development. The Sporting Goods business competes in a variety of categories including basketball goals, archery, indoor
and outdoor game recreation and fitness products. Strong brands and on-going investment in product development provide a solid
foundation for building customer loyalty and continued growth. 

Within the sporting goods industry, the Company has successfully
built a robust market presence in several niche markets. This strategy is heavily dependent on expanding our customer base, barriers
to entry, strong brands, excellent customer service and a commitment to innovation. A key strategic advantage is the Company s
established relationships with major customers that allow the Company to bring new products to market in a cost effective manner
while maintaining a diversified portfolio of products to meet the demands of consumers. In addition to strategic customer relations,
the Company has substantial manufacturing and import experience that enable it to be a low cost supplier. Concentrated focus on
the sporting goods industry will allow the Company to leverage its strength in these markets. 

To enhance growth opportunities, the Company has focused on
promoting new product innovation and development and brand marketing. In addition, the Company has embarked on a strategy of acquiring
companies or product lines that complement or expand the Company s existing product lines or provide expansion into new or emerging
categories in sporting goods. A key objective is the acquisition of product lines with barriers to entry that the Company can take
to market through its established distribution channels or through new market channels. Significant synergies are achieved through
assimilation of acquired product lines into the existing Company structure. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company acquired
substantially all of the business and assets of Triumph Sports USA, Inc. s business, a brand known for its innovative lines
of indoor and outdoor games. The Company also sometimes divests or discontinues certain operations, assets, and products that do
not perform to the Company s expectations or no longer fit with the Company s strategic objectives. 

Results of Operations  

The following schedule sets forth certain consolidated statement
of operations data as a percentage of net revenue: 

Revenue and Gross
Margin   

Revenue from the Sporting Goods business was up 12.2% for the
third quarter of 2016 and up 9.0% for the first nine months of 2016. Sales increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed
during 2015 and 2016 as well as new product offerings introduced into the market during 2016, but were partially offset by continued
declines in the archery business. 

The overall gross margin percentage decreased to 27.9% for the
first nine months of 2016, compared to 29.9% for the same period in the prior year. The reduction in gross margin is a combination
of decreased sales in the archery category as well as an unfavorable change in product mix. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses   

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) decreased
as a percent of net sales to 17.4% for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 18.8% experienced in the same period last year.
SG A was favorably impacted by the gain recognized on the sale of our Wabash, IN facility. SG A for 2016 was unfavorably
impacted by one-time costs associated with bad debt expenses incurred related to Sports Authority s bankruptcy filing and
increased marketing efforts and selling expenses for new products introduced in 2016. 

Provision for Income
Taxes   

The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was
27.6% compared to 29.1% for the same period last year. 

Financial Condition
and Liquidity   

Total debt at the end of the first nine months of 2016 was $37.4
million, an increase of $14.1 million from December 26, 2015. Cash used for acquisitions was the primary driver for the increase
in total debt. Notes payable increased 10% as compared with same period last year and increased 55% as compared with year end.
The following schedule summarizes the Company s total debt: 

As a percentage of stockholders  equity, total debt was
37%, 24% and 34% at October 1, 2016, December 26, 2015, and October 3, 2015 respectively. 

On January 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement ( Restated Credit Agreement ) with its issuing bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Chase ),
and the other lenders identified in the Restated Credit Agreement (collectively, the  Lender ). Under the terms of
the Restated Credit Agreement, the Lender has made available to the Company a senior revolving credit facility in an increased
maximum amount of up to $35.0 million and a term loan in an increased principal amount of $7.5 million. The maturity date of the
revolving credit facility was extended to January 21, 2019 and the maturity of the term loan facility was extended to January 21,
2021. 

The Company funds working capital requirements through operating
cash flows and revolving credit agreements with its bank. Based on working capital requirements, the Company expects to have access
to adequate levels of revolving credit to meet growth needs. 

Item
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is exposed to financial market risks, including
changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize these risks through regular operating and
financing activities and, when considered appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. During the quarter
there were no derivatives in use. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. 

Interest Rates  
The Company s exposure to market-rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its revolving variable rate
bank debt which is based on LIBOR interest rates. A hypothetical 1% or 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have
a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operation. 

Foreign Currency  
 The Company conducts business in various countries around the world and is therefore subject to risks
associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates. The Sporting Goods foreign currency transactions are denominated primarily
in Mexican Peso and Chinese Yuan. The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture, Stiga, which is denominated in Swedish Krona.  

The geographic areas outside the United States in which the
Company operated are generally not considered by management to be highly inflationary. Nonetheless, the Company s foreign
operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from, among other things, certain inter-company transactions
that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency. Operating results as well as assets and liabilities
are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation when the operating results, assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. 

The Company and its subsidiaries conduct substantially all their
business in their respective functional currencies to avoid the effects of cross-border transactions. To protect against reductions
in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, the Company carefully considers
the use of transaction and balance sheet hedging programs such as matching assets and liabilities in the same currency. Such programs
reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate changes. The Company has evaluated the use of currency
exchange hedging financial instruments but has determined that it would not use such instruments under the current circumstances.
Changes in currency exchange rates may be volatile and could affect the Company s performance. 

Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Escalade maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, could provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As the Company does
not control or manage these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially
more limited than those it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

Management of the Company has evaluated, with the participation
of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, changes in the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2016. 

There have been no changes to the Company s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of the Company s first quarter of 2016 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
