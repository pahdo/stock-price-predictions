NOTE
1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

Pacific
Special Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) is an organized blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
on July 1, 2015. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation,
purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities ( Business Combination ). Although the Company is not
limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends
to focus on businesses that have their primary operations located in Asia (with an emphasis on China).  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through September 30, 2016 relates to the Company s
formation, its initial public offering ( Initial Public Offering ), which is described below, and identifying a target
company for a Business Combination.  

The
registration statement for the Initial Public Offering was declared effective on October 14, 2015. On October 20, 2015, the Company
consummated the Initial Public Offering of 5,000,000 units ( Units  and, with respect to the ordinary shares included
in the Units, the  Public Shares ) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000, which is described
in Note 4.  

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 477,500 Units (the  Private Units 
and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Private Units, the  Private Shares ), of which 452,500 Private
Units were purchased by the Company s sponsor and 25,000 Private Units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. ( EBC ),
in each case, at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $4,775,000, which is
described in Note 5.  

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on October 20, 2015, an amount of $52,000,000 ($10.40 per Unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Units was placed in a trust account ( Trust Account )
and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that
holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4)
of Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination
or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.  

On
October 23, 2015, EBC elected to fully exercise their over-allotment option to purchase 750,000 Units (the  Over-allotment
Units ) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000. In addition, on October 23, 2015,
the Company consummated the sale of an additional 54,375 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, of which 45,171 Units were
purchased by the Company s sponsor and 9,204 Units were purchased by EBC, generating gross proceeds of $543,750. Following
the closing, an additional $7,800,000 of net proceeds ($10.40 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account, resulting in $59,800,000
($10.40 per Unit) held in the Trust Account.  

Transaction
costs amounted to $2,295,923, consisting of $1,868,750 of underwriting fees and $427,173 of Initial Public Offering costs. In
addition, following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, $722,827 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account and was
available for working capital purposes.  

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public
Offering and Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. The Company s Units are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market ( NASDAQ ). Pursuant to
the NASDAQ listing rules, the Company s Business Combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective
fair market value is equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement
for such Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.  

The
Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion
of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii)
by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a
Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of
whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata
portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.40 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held
in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations or working capital requirements). In
such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001
upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business
Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or
other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing
substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with
whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a  group  (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15%
or more of the ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without the Company s prior written consent.

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   SEPTEMBER

   (Unaudited)   

The
Company s sponsor, officers and directors (the  initial shareholders ) have agreed (a) to vote their founder
shares (as defined in Note 6), Public Shares and Private Shares in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment
to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business Combination activities
prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity
to redeem their shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the founder shares and
Private Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business
Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder
approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to
shareholders  rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the founder shares and Private Shares shall not participate
in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated.  

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the
 Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but no more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares which redemption
will completely extinguish public shareholders  rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation
distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject
to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation
and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and
the requirements of applicable law.  

In
connection with the redemption of 100% of the Company s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the
Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company for its working capital requirements
or necessary to pay the Company s taxes payable. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets initially $10.40) will be less than
the Initial Public Offering price per Unit.  

The
initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the founder shares and the Private Shares (i)
in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination
within the Combination Period. However, if the Company s initial shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the
Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to
consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period.  

Jian
Tu, the President and Chairman of the Board of the Company, has agreed that he will indemnify the Company to the extent necessary
to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other
entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company, but only
if such a vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, Mr. Tu may not be able to meet such obligation
as the Company has not required Mr. Tu to retain any assets to provide for his indemnification obligations, nor has the Company
taken any further steps to ensure that Mr. Tu will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, Mr.
Tu will not be personally liable to the Company s public shareholders if Mr. Tu should fail to satisfy his obligations under
this agreement and instead will only be liable to the Company. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Tu will
have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than
the Company s independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business,
execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust
Account. Therefore, the distribution from the Trust Account to each holder of ordinary shares may be less than approximately $10.40
per share.  

NOTE
2. LIQUIDITY    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had $317,437 in its operating bank account, $59,912,540 in cash and marketable securities held
in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its ordinary shares in connection therewith
and working capital of $130,835. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $114,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account
represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company s tax obligations or fund its working capital requirements.
Since inception, the Company has not withdrawn any interest income from the Trust Account.

   (Unaudited)   

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company uses the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures,
selecting the target business to acquire, structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination, paying for public
company expenses and annual outside directors fees.  

The Company does
not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating its business. However,
in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s
sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, officers or directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time
to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion (see Note 6). 

NOTE
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Emerging
growth company    

The
Company is an  emerging growth company,  as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the
 Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the  JOBS Act ), and
it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its
periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The
Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and
it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the
new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s
financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which
has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant
standards used.  

Basis
of presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for
interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive
presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a
normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows
for the periods presented.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016 as filed with the SEC on September 28, 2016, which contains the audited financial statements
and notes thereto, together with Management s Discussion and Analysis. The financial information as of June 30, 2016 is
derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2016. The interim results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the year ending June 30, 2017 or for any future interim periods.

   (Unaudited)   

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered
in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ significantly from those estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents    

The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  

Cash
and marketable securities held in Trust Account    

The
amounts held in the Trust Account represent substantially all of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and are classified
as restricted assets since such amounts can only be used by the Company in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination.
As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account consisted of United States
Treasury Bills with a maturity date of 180 days or less which are classified as trading securities.  

Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption    

The Company accounts
for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.  Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified
as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that
feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain
events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are
classified as shareholders  equity. The Company s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered
to be outside of the Company s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares
subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders  equity section of the Company s
balance sheet. 

Income
taxes    

The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires an
asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future
taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.  

ASC
Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company s management determined that the British Virgin Islands
is the Company s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016. The Company is currently
not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.  

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal, U.S. states or foreign taxing authorities in the area of income
taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various
tax jurisdictions and compliance with U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign tax laws. The Company s management does not expect
that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.  

The
provision for income taxes was deemed to be immaterial for the period ended September 30, 2016.

Net
loss per share    

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Net loss per
share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Weighted
average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 187,500 ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment
option was not exercised by the underwriters (see Note 8). As a result of the underwriters  election to  exercise
their over-allotment option on October 23, 2015, 187,500 ordinary shares were no longer subject to forfeiture and are therefore
included in the  calculation of basic loss per share as of such date .  Ordinary shares
subject to possible redemption at September 30, 2016 have been excluded from the calculation of basic loss per share since such
shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the
effect of (1) warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Units sold in the private placement
to purchase an aggregate of 3,140,937 ordinary shares, (2) rights included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering and
the Private Units sold in the private placement that convert into an aggregate of 628,187 ordinary shares and (3) 400,000 ordinary
shares, warrants to purchase 200,000 ordinary shares and rights that convert into 40,000 ordinary shares underlying the unit purchase
option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants and the conversion
of the rights into ordinary shares is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per share is
the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented.  

Concentration
of credit risk    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. At September 30, 2016, the Company had not experienced
losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.  

Fair
value of financial instruments    

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily
due to their short-term nature.  

Recently
issued accounting standards    

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

NOTE
4. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING   

Pursuant
to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 5,750,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, inclusive of 750,000
Over-allotment Units sold to the underwriters on October 23, 2015 upon the underwriters election to fully exercise their over-allotment
option. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one right ( Public Right ) and one redeemable warrant
( Public Warrant ). Each right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of a Business
Combination (see Note 8). Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one half of one ordinary share at an exercise price
of $12.00 per whole share (see Note 8).  

NOTE
5. PRIVATE PLACEMENT   

Simultaneously
with the Initial Public Offering, the Company s sponsor and EBC purchased an aggregate of 531,875 Private Units at $10.00
per Unit, of which 497,671 Private Units were purchased by the Company s sponsor and 34,204 Private Units were purchased
by EBC, generating gross proceeds of $5,318,750 in the aggregate. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the net proceeds
from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public
Offering, except with respect to the warrants underlying the Private Units ( Private Warrants ), as described in Note
8. Additionally, the holders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except
to certain permitted transferees and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees
of the founder shares must agree to) until after the completion of a Business Combination.  

NOTE
6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Founder
Shares   

In
July 2015, the Company issued 1,437,500 ordinary shares to its initial shareholders (the  founder shares ) for an
aggregate purchase price of $25,000. The founder shares are identical to the Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering,
except that (1) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, and (2) the
initial shareholders have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and Public Shares in
connection with the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their liquidation rights with respect to their founder
shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.

   (Unaudited)   

The
1,437,500 founder shares included an aggregate of up to 187,500 shares which were subject to forfeiture by the sponsor to the
extent that the underwriters  over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the initial shareholders would
collectively own 20% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (excluding the sale
of the Private Units). As a result of the underwriters  election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 187,500
founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.  

Additionally,
the initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founder shares (except to certain permitted transferees)
until, with respect to 50% of the founder shares, the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business
Combination, or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Company s ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share
for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, with respect to the remaining
50% of the founder shares, upon one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case,
if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar
transaction which results in all of the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash,
securities or other property.  

Related
Party Advances   

As
of September 30, 2016, certain members of the Company s management incurred an aggregate of $121,636 of target identification
expenses. These expenses have been paid by management on behalf of the Company and are therefore recorded as advances from related
parties in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured
and due on demand.  

Administrative
Services Arrangement   

The
Company entered into an agreement with its Chairman whereby, commencing on October 20, 2015 through the earlier of the Company s
consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, an affiliate of the Chairman makes available to the Company certain
services, including office space, utilities and administrative services, as the Company may require from time to time. The Company
has agreed to pay the affiliate of the Chairman $10,000 per month for these services. For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $30,000 and $0, respectively, in fees for these services.  

Related
Party Loans   

In order to finance
transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor, officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required ( Working Capital Loans ). If
the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that a Business Combination
does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but
no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans, other than the interest on such proceeds
that may be released for working capital purposes. Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes
would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up
to $500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Private Units at a price of $10.00
per Unit (see Note 9). 

NOTE
7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Director
Compensation    

The
Company will pay each of its independent directors an annual retainer of $30,000 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable
in arrears commencing on the first anniversary of the Initial Public Offering and ending on the earlier of a Business Combination
and the Company s liquidation. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had accrued $82,500 and $80,000,
respectively, of directors  fees payable, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying
condensed balance sheets.  

Registration
Rights    

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into on October 14, 2015, the holders of the majority of the founder shares and Private
Units (and underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. They are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding
short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain  piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination. However,
the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities
Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements.

Merger
and Acquisition Agreement    

On
October 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Merger and Acquisition Agreement with EBC wherein EBC will act as an advisor in connection
with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its shareholders to discuss the potential Business
Combination and the target business  attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing
the Company s securities, assist the Company in obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the
Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination.  

The
Company will pay EBC a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to $1,750,000
(exclusive of any applicable finders  fees which might become payable). Such amount may be paid out of the funds held in
the Trust Account.  

Unit
Purchase Option    

On
October 20, 2015, the Company sold to EBC, for $100, an option to purchase up to a total of 400,000 Units exercisable at $10.00
per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $4,000,000) commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date
of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering and the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit
purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and expires five years from the
effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units issuable upon exercise of this
option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive
of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to shareholders 
equity. The Company estimated that the fair value of this unit purchase option was approximately $1,315,901 (or $3.29 per Unit)
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option to be granted to the underwriters was
estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest
rate of 1.40% and (3) expected life of five years. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the
ordinary shares underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the ordinary shares that are issuable for the rights
included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation
by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA s NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally,
the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day
period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial
Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and  piggy back  rights
for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration
under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The Company will bear
all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the
holders themselves.  

The
exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in
the event of a stock dividend, or the Company s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the
option will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price.  

NOTE
8. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY    

Preferred
Shares   - The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of no par value preferred shares, divided into five classes,
Class A through Class E, each with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined by a resolution of the Company s
board of directors to amend the Memorandum and Articles of Association to create such designations, rights and preferences. The
Company has five classes of preferred shares to give the Company flexibility as to the terms on which each Class is issued. All
shares of a single class must be issued with the same rights and obligations. Accordingly, starting with five classes of preferred
shares will allow the Company to issue shares at different times on different terms. At September 30, 2016, there are no preferred
shares designated, issued or outstanding.  

Ordinary Shares  
- The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of no par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company s ordinary
shares are entitled to one vote for each share. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there were 2,436,685 and 2,422,786 ordinary
shares issued and outstanding (excluding 5,282,690 and 5,296,589 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption). 

Rights
  - Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of a Business Combination,
even if the holder of such right redeemed all ordinary shares held by him, her or it in connection with a Business Combination
or an amendment to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business
Combination activities. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive his,
her or its additional ordinary shares upon consummation of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been
included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. The shares issuable upon exchange of
the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company enters into a definitive
agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide
for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the ordinary shares will receive in the transaction
on an as-converted into ordinary share basis.

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held
in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive
any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights
will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights
upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights.
Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.  

Warrants
  - Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise
of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the consummation of a Business Combination
or (b) 12 months from the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Initial Public Offering. No Public Warrants
will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary shares
issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within
90 days from the consummation of a Business Combination, the holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise the
Public Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption
from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. The Public
Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.  

The
Company may call the warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Warrants but including any outstanding warrants issued upon
exercise of the unit purchase option issued to EBC and/or its designees), in whole and not in part, at a price of $.01 per warrant:  

at
    any time while the Public Warrants are exercisable,   

upon
    not less than 30 days  prior written notice of redemption to each Public Warrant holder,   

if,
    and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share, for any 20 trading days
    within a 30 trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to Public Warrant holders,
    and   

if,
    and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants
    at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until
    the date of redemption.   

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
the Public Warrants to do so on a  cashless basis,  as described in the warrant agreement.  

The
Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except the Private
Warrants are exercisable for cash (even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such
Private Warrants is not effective) or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and will not redeemable by the Company,
in each case so long as they are still held by the initial shareholders or their affiliates. Additionally, EBC has agreed that
it and its designees will not be permitted to exercise any Private Warrants underlying the Private Units after the five year anniversary
of the effective date of the Initial Public Offering.  

The
exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However,
the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event
will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any
of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside
of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

The
Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial

adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.  

On
November 9, 2016, the sponsor loaned the Company $500,000 ( Convertible Promissory Note ) to be used for the Company s
expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements. The Convertible Promissory
Note is non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of: (i) April 20, 2017; or (ii) the date on which the Company consummates
a Business Combination. The Convertible Promissory Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at the election of the sponsor, upon
the consummation of Business Combination. Upon such election, the Convertible Promissory Note will convert into Private Units,
at a price of $10.00 per Unit.

Overview   

We
are a blank check company incorporated on July 1, 2015 in the British Virgin Islands and formed for the purpose of consummating
a Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering
and the sale of Private Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our capital stock,
debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.  

Results
of Operations   

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception to September 30,
2016 relates to our formation, our Initial Public Offering and private placement and the identification and evaluation of prospective
candidates for a Business Combination. Since the completion of our Initial Public Offering, we have not generated any operating
revenues and will not generate such revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and securities held, which we expect to be insignificant in view of the low interest
rates on risk-free investments. We have incurred expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting,
accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses and other expenses relating to our efforts to consummate
a Business Combination.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $112,266, mainly consisting of operating costs and target identification
expenses of $147,607, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $22,412 and an unrealized
gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $12,930. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we had a net
loss of $2,975, mainly consisting of formation costs.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

On
October 20, 2015, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 5,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 477,500 Private
Units, of which 452,500 Private Units were purchased by our sponsor and 25,000 Private Units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. ( EBC ), in each case, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,775,000.  

On
October 23, 2015, the underwriters elected to fully exercise their over-allotment option to purchase 750,000 Over-allotment Units
at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000. In addition, on October 23, 2015, we consummated
the sale of an additional 54,375 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, of which 45,171 Units were purchased by our sponsor
and 9,204 Units were purchased by EBC, generating gross proceeds of $543,750.  

Following
the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of the over-allotment option, a total of $59,800,000 was placed in the Trust Account,
while the remaining funds of $722,827 were placed in an account outside of the Trust Account for working capital purposes. We
incurred $2,295,923 in Initial Public Offering related costs, including $1,868,750 of underwriting fees and $427,173 of Initial
Public Offering costs.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $59,912,540, substantially all of which is invested
in U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be
available to us to pay taxes or for working capital purposes. Through September 30, 2016, we did not withdraw any funds from the
interest earned on the trust account.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $317,437 held outside the Trust Account, which is available for use by us to cover the costs
associated with identifying a target business, negotiating a Business Combination, due diligence procedures and other general
corporate uses. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had accounts payable and accrued expenses of $126,912.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities amounted to $176,088, mainly resulting from a net
loss of $112,266, interest earned on the Trust Account of $22,412, unrealized gains on marketable securities of $12,930 and changes
in our working capital of $28,480.  

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EBC for its services in connection with our Business Combination upon the
consummation of such combination in an amount equal to $1,750,000. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other
net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business  operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any
operating expenses or finders  fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds
available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses.  

We
intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business
due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses,
and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.  

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. This
belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication
of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition,
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial
Business Combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial
Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from the Trust
Account is minimal as a result of the current interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans
or additional investments from members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation
to advance funds to, or invest in, us. In the event that the Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used
for such repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our
Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our Business Combination into additional Private Units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The terms of such loans
by our initial shareholders, officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans.  

On
November 9, 2016, the sponsor loaned us $500,000 to be used for expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business
and other working capital requirements. The Convertible Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of: (i)
April 20, 2017; or (ii) the date on which we consummate a Business Combination. The Convertible Promissory Note is convertible,
in whole or in part, at the election of the sponsor, upon the consummation of Business Combination. Upon such election, the Convertible
Promissory Note will convert into Private Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit.  

Off-balance
sheet financing arrangements   

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in
transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.  

Contractual
obligations   

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an
agreement to pay an affiliate of the Company s Chairman a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial
support provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on October 14, 2015 and will continue to incur these fees monthly
until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and the Company s liquidation. In addition, we will pay
each of our independent directors an annual retainer of $30,000 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing
on the first anniversary of the Initial Public Offering and ending on the earlier of a Business Combination and our liquidation.  

Significant
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income
and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the
following significant accounting policy:  

Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption   

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 480  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.  Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption
(if any) are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including
ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon
the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary
shares are classified as shareholders  equity. Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered
to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016 and June
30, 1016, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
equity section of our balance sheet.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company s condensed financial statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

The
net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares held in the Trust Account may be invested
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the
short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.
Based upon his evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed on September 28, 2016 with the SEC. Any of these factors
could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk
factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report
filed with the SEC, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future
filings with the SEC.
