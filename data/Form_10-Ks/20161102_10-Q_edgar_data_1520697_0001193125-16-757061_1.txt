  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  September 30, 2015   
  (Unaudited)      1. Description of Business
and Basis of Presentation       Description of Business    
 Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (the  Company ) develops and operates inpatient psychiatric facilities, residential treatment
centers, group homes, substance abuse facilities and facilities providing outpatient behavioral healthcare services to serve the behavioral health and recovery needs of communities throughout the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (U.K.) and
Puerto Rico. At September 30, 2016, the Company operated 589 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 17,900 beds in 39 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico.  
   Basis of Presentation      The
business of the Company is conducted through limited liability companies, C-corporations and, for the U.K. facilities, their foreign counterparts. The Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
subsidiaries controlled by the Company through its  direct or indirect ownership of majority interests and exclusive rights granted to the Company as the controlling member of an entity. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations have been included. The Company s fiscal year ends on December 31 and interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any other interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The information contained in
these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior years to conform to the current year presentation.     2. Earnings Per Share   
 Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 260,   Earnings Per Share ,  based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in each period and dilutive stock options, unvested shares and warrants, to the extent such securities have a dilutive effect on
earnings per share.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands except per share amounts):      
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 0.2 million and
0.3 million, respectively, of the outstanding restricted stock and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the net loss for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 causes such securities to be anti-dilutive. Approximately 0.3 million and 0.9 million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards were excluded
from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
  3. Acquisitions       2016 U.S. Acquisitions
     On June 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Pocono Mountain Recovery Center ( Pocono Mountain ), an
inpatient psychiatric facility with 108 beds located in Henryville, Pennsylvania, for total consideration of approximately $25.2 million. The Company may make a cash payment of up to $5.0 million under an earn-out agreement, contingent upon
achievement by Pocono Mountain of certain operating performance targets for the one-year period ending May 31, 2017.    On May 1,
2016, the Company completed the acquisition of TrustPoint Hospital ( TrustPoint ), an inpatient psychiatric facility with 100 beds located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, for cash consideration of approximately $62.7 million.  
 On April 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Serenity Knolls ( Serenity Knolls ), an inpatient psychiatric

    Planned U.K. Divestiture    
 The Competition and Markets Authority (the  CMA ) in the U.K. has been reviewing the Company s acquisition of Priory. On
July 14, 2016, the CMA announced that the Company s acquisition of Priory will be referred for a phase 2 investigation unless the Company offered acceptable undertakings to address the CMA s competition concerns relating to the
provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets. On July 28, 2016, the CMA announced that the Company had offered undertakings to address the CMA s concerns and that, in lieu of a phase 2 investigation, the CMA would
consider the Company s undertakings.    On October 18, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners ( BC
Partners ) for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds (collectively, the  U.K. Disposal Group ). The Company s management
believes that the planned divestiture addresses the CMA s competition concerns. The Company expects the sale to be approved by the CMA on or before November 18, 2016 and expects to complete the sale shortly thereafter. If the sale is
approved by the CMA and completed, the Company will receive  320 million cash for the sale. If the sale is not approved by the CMA, the Company expects that the CMA will proceed with a phase 2 investigation.  
 In conjunction with the planned divestiture, the Company recorded $389.7 million as assets held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet at September 30, 2016 and a loss on divestiture of $174.7 million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The loss on divestiture consisted of an allocation of
goodwill to the U.K. Disposal Group of $106.9 million, estimated transaction-related expenses of $25.6 million and loss on the sale of properties of $42.2 million. The Company is required to measure assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying
value or fair value less cost to sell. The allocation of goodwill was based on the fair value of the U.K. Disposal Group relative to the total fair value of the Company s U.K. Facilities segment.  
 The condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include revenue of
$45.6 million and $125.1 million, respectively, and income from continuing operations before income taxes of $3.2 million and $12.2 million, respectively, related to the U.K. Disposal Group excluding the loss on divestiture. The
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include revenue of $16.6 million and $42.1 million, respectively, and income from continuing operations before income taxes of
$4.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively, related to the U.K. Disposal Group.      2015 U.S. Acquisitions    
 On December 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of certain facilities from MMO Behavioral Health Systems ( MMO ),
including two acute inpatient behavioral health facilities with a total of 80 beds located in Jennings and Covington, Louisiana, for cash consideration of approximately $20.2 million.  
 On November 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisitions of (i) Discovery House-Group Inc. ( Discovery House ) for
cash consideration of approximately $118.3 million and (ii) Duffy s Napa Valley Rehab ( Duffy s ) for cash consideration of approximately $29.6 million. Discovery House operates 19 comprehensive treatment centers
located in four states. Duffy s is a substance abuse facility with 61 beds located in Calistoga, California.    On August 31,
2015, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Southcoast Behavioral ( Southcoast ), an inpatient psychiatric facility located in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The Company owns 75% of the equity interests in the
facility. The value of the 25% noncontrolling interest approximates $9.2 million.    On July 1, 2015, the Company completed the
acquisition of the assets of Belmont Behavioral Health ( Belmont ), an inpatient psychiatric facility with 147 beds located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for cash consideration of approximately $39.0 million which consists of
$35.0 million base purchase price and a working capital settlement of $4.0 million.    On March 1, 2015, the Company acquired the stock
of Quality Addiction Management, Inc. ( QAM ) for cash consideration of approximately $54.8 million. QAM operates seven comprehensive treatment centers located in Wisconsin.  
 On February 11, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of CRC Health Group, Inc. ( CRC ) for total consideration of
approximately $1.3 billion. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 5,975,326 shares of its common stock to certain holders of CRC common stock and repaid CRC s outstanding indebtedness of $904.5 million. CRC is a leading
provider of treatment services related to substance abuse and other addiction and behavioral disorders. At the acquisition date, CRC operated 35 inpatient facilities with over 2,400 beds and 81 comprehensive treatment centers located in 30 states.

 The Company selectively seeks opportunities to expand and diversify its base of operations by acquiring additional facilities. Approximately
$374.4 million of the goodwill associated with domestic acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 is deductible for federal income tax purposes. The fair values assigned to certain assets and liabilities assumed by the Company have been estimated
on a preliminary basis and are subject to change as new facts and circumstances emerge that were present at the date of acquisition. Specifically, the Company is further assessing the valuation of certain real property and intangible assets and
certain tax matters as well as certain receivables and assumed liabilities of Pocono Mountain, TrustPoint, Serenity Knolls, Priory, MMO, Discovery House, Duffy s, Cleveland House and Meadow View.

 On January 25, 2016, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (the  Ninth Amendment ) to the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. The Ninth Amendment modifies certain definitions and provides increased flexibility to the Company in terms of its financial covenants. The Company s baskets for permitted investments were also increased to provide increased
flexibility for it to invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries. The Company may now invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures up to 10.0% of the Company and its subsidiaries  total assets
in any four consecutive fiscal quarter period, and up to 12.5% of the Company and its subsidiaries  total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company may also invest in foreign subsidiaries that are not loan
parties up to 10% of the Company and its subsidiaries  total assets in any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, and up to 15% of the Company and its subsidiaries  total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. The foregoing permitted investments are subject to an aggregate cap of 25% of the Company and its subsidiaries  total assets in any fiscal year.  
 On February 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Incremental Facility Amendment (the  Second Incremental Amendment ) to
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Incremental Amendment activated a new $955.0 million incremental Term Loan B facility (the  New TLB Facility ) and added $135.0 million to the Term Loan A facility (the  TLA
Facility ) to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility, subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the New TLB Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and
expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility.  
 On May 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment (the  Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment ) to the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment reduces the Applicable Rate with respect to the Existing TLB Facility from 3.5% to 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.5% to 2.0% in the case of Base Rate Loans.
   On September 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment (the  Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment )
to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment reduces the Applicable Rate with respect to the New TLB Facility from 3.75% to 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.75% to 2.0% in the case of Base Rate
Loans. In connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.4 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in
the condensed consolidated statements of income.    The Company had $120.6 million of availability under the revolving line of credit as of
September 30, 2016. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit are subject to customary conditions precedent to borrowing. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires quarterly term loan principal repayments of our TLA Facility of
$12.6 million for September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016, $16.8 million for March 31, 2017 to December 31, 2017, and $20.9 million for March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2018, with the remaining principal balance of
the TLA Facility due on the maturity date of February 13, 2019. The Company is required to repay the Existing TLB Facility in equal quarterly installments of $1.3 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December,
with the outstanding principal balance of the Existing TLB Facility due on February 11, 2022. The Company is required to repay the New TLB Facility in equal quarterly installments of approximately $2.4 million on the last business day of
each March, June, September and December, with the outstanding principal balance of the TLB Facility due on February 16, 2023.  
 Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of the Company s wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) and are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and such subsidiaries. Borrowings with respect to the TLA Facility and the Company s revolving credit facility
(collectively,  Pro Rata Facilities ) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate tied to Acadia s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as consolidated funded debt net of up to $40.0 million of unrestricted
and unencumbered cash to consolidated EBITDA, in each case as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the Pro Rata Facilities was 3.25% for Eurodollar
Rate Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and 2.25% for Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) at September 30, 2016. Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities
bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) (based upon the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) prior to commencement of the interest rate
period). Base Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As of
September 30, 2016, the Pro Rata Facilities bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts under the revolving line of credit.

  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply
with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio. The Company may be required to pay all of its indebtedness immediately if it
defaults on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in any of its material debt agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.  
   Senior Notes        6.125% Senior
Notes due 2021      On March 12, 2013, the Company issued $150.0 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  6.125% Senior
Notes ). The 6.125% Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.  
   5.125% Senior Notes due 2022    
 On July 1, 2014, the Company issued $300.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  5.125% Senior Notes ). The 5.125%
Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.

Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  
 On September 21, 2015, the Company issued $275.0 million of additional 5.625% Senior Notes. The additional notes form a single class of
debt securities with the existing 5.625% Senior Notes. Giving effect to this issuance, the Company has outstanding an aggregate of $650.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes.  
   6.500% Senior Notes due 2024    
 On February 16, 2016, the Company issued $390.0 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the  6.500% Senior Notes ). The 6.500%
Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016.  
 The indentures governing the 6.125% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.625% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes (together, the  Senior
Notes ) contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional
debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge,
consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company s assets; and (vii) create liens on assets.    The Senior Notes issued by the
Company are guaranteed by each of the Company s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.  
 The Company may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.  
   9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds    
 On November 11, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of Park Royal, the Company assumed debt of $23.0 million. The fair market value
of the debt assumed was $25.6 million and resulted in a debt premium balance being recorded as of the acquisition date. The debt consisted of $7.5 million and $15.5 million of Lee County (Florida) Industrial Development Authority Healthcare
Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 with stated interest rates of 9.0% and 9.5% ( 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds ), respectively. The 9.0% bonds in the amount of $7.5 million have a maturity date of December 1, 2030 and require yearly
principal payments beginning in 2013. The 9.5% bonds in the amount of $15.5 million have a maturity date of December 1, 2040 and require yearly principal payments beginning in 2031. The principal payments establish a bond sinking fund to be
held with the trustee and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amounts of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds on their respective maturity dates. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2.3 million was recorded within other
assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to the debt service reserve fund requirements. The yearly principal payments, which establish a bond sinking fund, will increase the debt service reserve fund requirements. The bond premium
amount of $2.6 million is amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the revenue bonds using the effective interest method.

   7. Equity Offerings   
   Common Stock      On March 3,
2016, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders, where the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock
from 90,000,000 to 180,000,000 (the  Amendment ). On March 3, 2016, the Company filed the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.  
   Equity Offerings      On
February 11, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of CRC for total consideration of approximately $1.3 billion. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 5,975,326 shares of its common stock to certain holders of CRC
common stock and repaid CRC s outstanding indebtedness.    On May 11, 2015, the Company completed the offering of 5,175,000 shares
of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that the Company granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a price of $66.50 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the
shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $12.0 million and additional offering-related costs of $0.8 million, were $331.3 million. The Company used the net offering proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and fund acquisitions.  
 On January 12, 2016, the Company completed the offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the
exercise of the over-allotment option that the Company granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a price of $61.00 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of
$15.8 million and additional offering-related costs of $0.7 million, were $685.0 million. The Company used the net offering proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory.  
 On February 16, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Priory, which included the issuance of 4,033,561 shares of common stock to
the former stockholders of Priory.     8. Equity-Based Compensation   
   Equity Incentive Plans      The Company
issues stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors under the Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Equity
Incentive Plan ). As of September 30, 2016, a maximum of 8,200,000 shares of the Company s common stock were authorized for issuance as stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units or other share-based compensation under
the Equity Incentive Plan, of which 4,662,863 shares were available for future grant. Stock options may be granted for terms of up to ten years. The Company recognizes expense on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the entire award. Grants to employees generally vest in annual increments of 25% each year, commencing one year after the date of grant. The exercise prices of stock options are equal to the most recent closing price of the
Company s common stock on the date of grant.    The Company recognized $7.1 million and $5.3 million in equity-based compensation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $21.0 million and $14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was $59.4 million
of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of 1.4 years. As of September 30, 2016, there
were no warrants outstanding. The Company recognized a deferred income tax benefit of $2.9 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to equity-based compensation expense. The Company
recognized a deferred income tax benefit of $8.3 million and $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to equity-based compensation expense. The actual tax benefit realized from stock options
exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $1.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively.

  The grant-date fair value of the Company s stock options is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes the grant-date fair value of options and the assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year
ended December 31, 2015:      
   The Company s estimate of expected volatility for stock options is based upon the volatility of guideline
companies given the lack of sufficient historical trading experience of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected option life on the
date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held before it is exercised.     9. Income Taxes   
 The provision for income taxes for continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflects effective tax
rates of (2.1)% and 30.4%, respectively. The provision for income taxes for continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflects effective tax rates of (292.8)% and 31.0%, respectively. The change in the tax rate
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the loss on divestiture related to our planned divestiture in the U.K.  
  10. Derivative Instruments     The Company
entered into foreign currency forward contracts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in connection with (i) acquisitions in the U.K. and (ii) transfers of cash between the U.S. and U.K. under the
Company s cash management and foreign currency risk management programs. Foreign currency forward contracts limit the economic risk of changes in the exchange rate between US Dollars ( USD ) and British Pounds ( GBP )
associated with cash transfers. These foreign currency forward contracts did not meet the hedge accounting criteria under Accounting Standards Codification 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . As such, changes in fair value resulted in gains of $15
thousand and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and losses of $1.0 million and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which have been recorded in
the consolidated statements of income.    In May 2016, the Company entered into multiple cross currency swap agreements with an aggregate
notional amount of $650.0 million to manage foreign currency risk by effectively converting a portion of its fixed-rate USD-denominated senior notes, including the semi-annual interest payments thereunder, to fixed-rate GBP-denominated debt of
 449.3 million. The senior notes effectively converted include $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes and $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of
5.625% Senior Notes. During the term of the swap agreements, the Company will receive semi-annual interest payments in USD from the counterparties at fixed interest rates, and the Company will make semi-annual interest payments in GBP to the
counterparties at fixed interest rates. The interest payments under the cross-currency swap agreements result in  24.7 million of annual cash flows, from the Company s U.K. business being converted to $35.8 million (at a 1.45
exchange rate). The interest rates applicable to the GBP interest payments are substantially the same as the interest rates in place for the existing USD-denominated debt. At maturity, the Company will repay the principal amounts listed above in GBP
and receive the principal amount in USD.    The Company has designated the cross currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments
and is accounting for these as net investment hedges. The fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of $49.9 million is recorded as an asset within derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses
resulting from fair value adjustments to the cross currency swap agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as the swaps are effective in hedging the designated risk. Cash flows related to the cross currency swaps are included
in operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.     11. Fair Value Measurements   
 The carrying amounts reported for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current
liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Table of Contents  

  The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s Amended and Restated Senior Credit
Facility, 6.125% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.625% Senior Notes, 6.500% Senior Notes, 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, derivative instruments and contingent consideration liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were
as follows (in thousands):      
   The Company s Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility, 6.125% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes,
5.625% Senior Notes, 6.500% Senior Notes and 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds were categorized as Level 2 in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. Fair values were based on trading activity among the Company s lenders and the average bid and ask price as
determined using published rates.    The fair values of the derivative instruments were categorized as Level 2 in the GAAP fair value
hierarchy and were based on observable market inputs including applicable exchange rates and interest rates.    The fair value of the
contingent consideration liabilities were categorized as Level 3 in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The contingent consideration liabilities were valued using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow method. This analysis reflected the
contractual terms of the purchase agreements and utilized assumptions with regard to future earnings, probabilities of achieving such future earnings and a discount rate.  
  12. Commitments and Contingencies       Professional and
General Liability      Effective September 1, 2016, a portion of the Company s professional liability risks is insured
through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention, the Company s 100% owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company for professional liability losses up to $50.0 million in the
aggregate. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance with unrelated commercial insurers for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $2.0 million and up to $50.0 million in the aggregate.  
   Legal Proceedings      The Company is,
from time to time, subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of the Company s business, including claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, breach of contract, tort and employment related
claims. In these actions, plaintiffs request a variety of damages, including, in some instances, punitive and other types of damages that may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, the Company is not currently a party to any
proceeding that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.  
  13. Noncontrolling Interests     On
May 2, 2016, the Company opened Crestwyn Behavioral Health, a de novo inpatient psychiatric facility located in Memphis, Tennessee. The Company owns 60% of the equity interests in the facility, and two noncontrolling partners each own 20%.
The value of the 40% noncontrolling interests approximates $6.0 million and is based on the fair value of contributions. The Company consolidates the operations of the facility based on its 60% equity ownership and its control of the entity.
The noncontrolling interests are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based on a put right that could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the
occurrence of a change in control.    On August 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest
in Southcoast, an inpatient psychiatric facility located in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The Company owns 75% of the equity interests in the facility. The value of the 25%  
      19

noncontrolling interest approximates $9.2 million. The Company considered an income approach and other valuation methodologies to value the noncontrolling interests. The Company consolidates
the operations of the facility based on its 75% equity ownership and its control of the entity. The noncontrolling interests are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based on a
put right that could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the occurrence of a change in control.     14. Other Current Assets

   16. Segment Information   
 The Company operates in one line of business, which is operating acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, specialty treatment facilities,
residential treatment centers and facilities providing outpatient behavioral healthcare services. As management reviews the operating results of its facilities in the U.S. (the  U.S. Facilities ) and its facilities in the U.K. (the
 U.K. Facilities ) separately to assess performance and make decisions, the Company s operating segments include its U.S. Facilities and U.K. Facilities. At September 30, 2016, the U.S. Facilities included 211 behavioral
healthcare facilities with approximately 8,500 beds in 39 states and Puerto Rico, and the U.K. Facilities included 378 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 9,400 beds in the U.K. The following tables set forth the financial
information by operating segment, including a reconciliation of Segment EBITDA to income from continuing operations before income taxes (in thousands):

Table of Contents  

(1)   
 Segment EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, gain/loss on foreign currency derivatives, transaction-related expenses, interest
expense and depreciation and amortization. The Company uses Segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure the performance of the Company s segments and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans for those segments. Segment
EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under
generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from Segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.    
 
  17. Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
 In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Additionally, ASU 2016-09 would permit both public and nonpublic organizations to adopt the new standard early. Management is evaluating the impact of
ASU 2016-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  
( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 s core principle is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Additionally, ASU 2016-02 would permit both public and nonpublic organizations to adopt the new standard early. Management is evaluating the impact of
ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards
Board issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 s core principal is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2017. Additionally, ASU 2014-09 would permit both public and nonpublic organizations to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original public organization effective date (that is, annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016). Management is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.     18. Subsequent
Events     On October 18, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners for the sale of 21 existing U.K.
behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. Management believes the planned divestiture addresses the CMA s competition concerns. The Company expects the sale to be
approved by the CMA on or before November 18, 2016 and expects to complete the sale shortly thereafter. If the sale is approved by the CMA and completed, the Company will receive  320 million cash for the sale. If the sale is
not approved by the CMA, the Company expects that the CMA will proceed with a phase 2 investigation.

   19. Financial Information for the Company and Its Subsidiaries   
 The Company conducts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. The 6.125% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.625% Senior
Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by all of the Company s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. Presented

  Overview     Our business strategy is to
acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality
services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At
September 30, 2016, we operated 589 behavioral healthcare facilities with over 17,900 beds in 39 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we acquired 328 facilities and added
approximately 688 new beds, including 548 beds to existing facilities and 140 beds added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to add approximately 800 total beds
exclusive of acquisitions.    We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in
the U.S. and the U.K. Management believes that the Company s recent acquisitions position the Company as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry
expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources,
increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count.  
  Acquisitions     On February 16, 2016,
we completed the acquisition of Priory for a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion, including total cash consideration of approximately $1.9 billion and the issuance of 4,033,561 shares of our common stock. Priory is the
leading independent provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.K. At February 16, 2016, Priory operated 324 facilities with approximately 7,100 beds.  
 On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Serenity Knolls, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 30 beds located in Forest
Knolls, California, for cash consideration of approximately $9.7 million.    On May 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of
TrustPoint, a behavioral health facility with a total of 100 beds located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, for cash consideration of approximately $62.7 million.

  On June 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain facilities from Pocono Mountain, an
inpatient psychiatric facility with 108 beds located in Henryville, Pennsylvania, for total consideration of approximately $25.2 million. We may make cash payments of up to $5.0 million under an earn-out agreement, contingent upon
achievement by Pocono Mountain of certain operating and performance targets for the one-year period ending May 31, 2017.      Planned U.K.
Divestiture      The CMA in the U.K. has been reviewing our acquisition of Priory. On July 14, 2016, the CMA announced that our
acquisition of Priory would be referred for a phase 2 investigation unless we offered acceptable undertakings to address the CMA s competition concerns relating to the provision of behavioral healthcare services in certain markets. On
July 28, 2016, the CMA announced that we had offered undertakings to address the CMA s concerns and that, in lieu of a phase 2 investigation, the CMA will consider our undertakings.  
 On October 18, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and
one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. We believe the planned divestiture addresses the CMA s competition concerns. We expect the sale to be approved by the CMA on or before November 18,
2016 and we expect to complete the sale shortly thereafter. If the sale is approved by the CMA and completed, we will receive  320 million cash for the sale. If the sale is not approved by the CMA, we expect that the CMA will proceed
with a phase 2 investigation.     Revenue   
 Our revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric
care and adolescent residential treatment. We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers;
(iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (iv) the NHS (including Local Authorities) in the U.K.; and (v) individual patients and clients. Revenue is recorded in the period in which services are
provided at established billing rates less contractual adjustments based on amounts reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third-party payors at contractually
determined rates.    The following table presents revenue by payor type and as a percentage of revenue before provision for doubtful
accounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):

   Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   
  Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts.  Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $256.1 million, or 52.4%,
to $744.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $488.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase related primarily to revenue generated during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from the facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. The decrease in the GBP to USD exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on revenue before provision for doubtful accounts
of $15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Same-facility revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased by $29.6 million, or 6.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015, resulting from same-facility growth in patient days of 6.3%. Consistent with the same-facility patient day growth in 2015, the growth in same-facility patient days for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.  
  Provision for doubtful accounts.  The provision for doubtful accounts was $10.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, or 1.4% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts, compared to $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 1.8% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts.

$253.1 million, or 52.8% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $148.0 million increase in SWB expense, excluding equity-based compensation expense, was primarily attributable to SWB expense incurred by the
facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same-facility SWB expense was $244.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 50.9% of revenue, compared to $224.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 49.6% of revenue.     Professional fees.  Professional fees were
$47.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 6.5% of revenue, compared to $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 6.4% of revenue. The $16.9 million increase was primarily
attributable to professional fees incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same-facility professional fees were $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
or 5.0% of revenue, compared to $25.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 5.6% of revenue.     Supplies.
 Supplies expense was $30.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 4.2% of revenue, compared to $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 4.5% of revenue. The $8.9 million increase
was primarily attributable to supplies expense incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same-facility supplies expense was $21.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, or 4.4% of revenue, compared to $19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 4.4% of revenue.

compared to $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 1.8% of revenue. The $11.2 million increase was primarily attributable to rents and leases incurred by the facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016
Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. Same-facility rents and leases were $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 1.8% of revenue, compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended

Priory. Same-facility other operating expenses were $52.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 11.0% of revenue, compared to $51.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 11.3% of revenue.

   Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense was
$36.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or 5.0% of revenue, compared to $16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or 3.5% of revenue. The increase in depreciation and amortization was
attributable to depreciation associated with capital expenditures during 2015 and 2016 and real estate acquired as part of the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory.  
  Interest expense.  Interest expense was $48.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $27.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility, the issuance of the 5.625% Senior Notes on September 21, 2015 and
the issuance of the 6.500% Senior Notes on February 16, 2016.     Debt extinguishment costs.  Debt extinguishment costs for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 represent $3.4 million of charges recorded in connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment. The debt extinguishment costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015 represent $6.9 million of
cash charges and $3.1 million of noncash charges recorded in connection with the purchase of approximately $88.3 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 12.875% Senior Notes.  
  Loss on divestiture.  As part of our planned divestiture in the U.K., we recorded $174.7 million of loss on divestiture for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, which included an allocation of goodwill to the U.K. Disposal Group of approximately $106.9 million, estimated transaction-related expenses of approximately $25.6 million and a loss on the sale of property of
$42.2 million.     (Gain) loss on foreign currency derivatives.  We entered into foreign currency forward contracts during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in connection with (i) acquisitions in the U.K. and (ii) transfers of cash between the U.S. and the U.K. under our cash management and foreign currency risk management programs. Exchange rate
changes between the contract date and the settlement date resulted in a gain on foreign currency derivatives of $15 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss on foreign currency derivatives of $1.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.     Transaction-related expenses.  Transaction-related expenses were $1.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods, primarily related to the 2015 and

    Provision for income taxes.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for
income taxes was $2.4 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of (2.1)%, compared to $12.7 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 30.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change in the tax rate for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the loss on divestiture related to our planned divestiture in the U.K.     Nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015      Revenue before provision for doubtful
accounts.  Revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $814.3 million, or 61.5%, to $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase related primarily to revenue generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the facilities acquired in our 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Priory. The decrease in the GBP to USD exchange
rate had an unfavorable impact on revenue before provision for doubtful accounts of $24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Same-facility revenue before provision for doubtful accounts increased $99.0 million, or
7.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting from same-facility growth in patient days of 7.4% and an increase in same-facility revenue per day of 0.3%. Consistent with
the same-facility patient day growth in 2015, the growth in same-facility patient days for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing
facilities and ongoing demand for our services.     Provision for doubtful accounts.  The provision for doubtful accounts was
$31.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 1.4% of revenue before provision for doubtful accounts, compared to $25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, or 1.9% of revenue before provision
for doubtful accounts.     Salaries, wages and benefits.  SWB expense was $1.2 billion for the nine months ended

during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in connection with (i) acquisitions in the U.K. and (ii) transfers of cash between the U.S. and the U.K. under our cash management and foreign currency risk management programs.
Exchange rate changes between the contract date and the settlement date resulted in a gain on foreign currency derivatives of $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss on foreign currency derivatives of
$1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

   Transaction-related expenses.  Transaction-related expenses were $33.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $31.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred in the respective periods, primarily related to the 2015 and 2016

    Provision for income taxes.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for income
taxes was $27.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of (292.8)%, compared to $34.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 31.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in the tax rate for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the loss on divestiture related to our planned divestiture in the U.K.     Liquidity and
Capital Resources     Cash provided by continuing operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$265.2 million compared to $143.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily attributable to cash provided by continuing operating activities
from the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions and the growth in same-facility operations. Days sales outstanding was 35 as of September 30, 2016 compared to 40 as of December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to the acquisition of Priory and its
shorter timing of cash collections. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $12.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively.  
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $971.8 million compared to $616.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of $683.3 million of cash paid for acquisitions. Cash paid for capital expenditures for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $250.0 million, consisting of $57.1 million of routine capital expenditures and $192.9 million of expansion capital expenditures. We define expansion capital expenditures as those that
increase the capacity of our facilities or otherwise enhance revenue. Routine or maintenance capital expenditures were 2.5% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash paid for real estate acquisitions was $37.9 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily consisted of $391.2 million of cash paid for acquisitions, $200.8 million of cash paid for
capital expenditures.    Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $738.2 million
compared to $432.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of long-term debt borrowings of $1.5 billion,
borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $179.0 million and an issuance of common stock of $685.1 million, partially offset by repayment of assumed Priory debt of $1.3 billion, payment on revolving credit facility of
$166.0 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $35.8 million, common stock withheld for minimum statutory taxes of $7.9 million and principal payments on long-term debt of $46.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily consisted of borrowings on long-term debt of $1.2 billion, borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $310.0 million, issuance of common stock of $331.4 million and an excess tax
benefit from equity awards of $8.0 million, partially offset by repayment of assumed CRC debt of $904.5 million, repayment of senior notes of $88.3 million, principal payments on our revolving credit facility of $310.0 million, payment of debt
issuance costs of $25.6 million, principal payments on long-term debt of $23.8 million, payment of premium for purchase of senior notes of $6.9 million and common stock withheld for minimum statutory taxes of $7.6 million.  
 We had total available cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million and $11.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, of which approximately $22.6 million and $9.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, respectively. Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our
operations in the U.S., except for cash transfers under our cross currency swap agreements and other intercompany debt agreements. It is our current intention to permanently reinvest our foreign cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S. If we
were to repatriate foreign cash to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with applicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation.

    Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility    
 We entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facility on April 1, 2011. On December 31, 2012, we entered into the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement which amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We have amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time as described in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 On February 6, 2015, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment added
Citibank, N.A. as an  L/C Issuer  under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in order to permit the rollover of CRC s existing letters of credit into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased both the Company s
Letter of Credit Sublimit and Swing Line Sublimit to $20.0 million.    On February 11, 2015, we entered into the First Incremental
Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The First Incremental Amendment activated a new $500.0 million incremental Existing TLB Facility that was added to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to limited
conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the Existing TLB Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of CRC.  
 On April 22, 2015, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eighth Amendment changed the
definition of  Change of Control  in part to remove a provision whose purpose was, when calculating whether a majority of incumbent directors have approved new directors, that any incumbent director that became a director as a result of a
threatened or actual proxy contest was not counted in such calculation.    On January 25, 2016, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to
our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Ninth Amendment modifies certain definitions and provides increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. Our baskets for permitted investments were also increased to provide increased
flexibility for us to invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries. We may now invest in non-wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures up to 10.0% of our and our subsidiaries  total assets in any
consecutive four fiscal quarter period, and up to 12.5% of our and our subsidiaries  total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We may also invest in foreign subsidiaries that are not loan parties up to 10% of
our and our subsidiaries  total assets in any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, and up to 15% of our and our subsidiaries  total assets during the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The foregoing permitted investments
are subject to an aggregate cap of 25% of our and our subsidiaries  total assets in any fiscal year.    On February 16, 2016, we
entered into the Second Incremental Facility Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Incremental Amendment activated a new $955.0 million incremental Term Loan B facility and added $135.0 million to the Term Loan A
facility to our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the New TLB Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and
expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility.  
 On May 26, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-1
Repricing Amendment reduces the Applicable Rate with respect to the Existing TLB Facility from 3.5% to 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.5% to 2.0% in the case of Base Rate Loans.  
 On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-2
Repricing Amendment reduces the Applicable Rate with respect to the New TLB Facility from 3.75% to 3.00% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.75% to 2.00% in the case of Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment,
we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.4 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of income.  
 We had $120.6 million of availability under the revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2016. Borrowings under the revolving
line of credit are subject to customary conditions precedent to borrowing. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires quarterly term loan principal repayments of our TLA Facility of $12.6 million for September 30, 2016 to
December 31, 2016, $16.8 million for March 31, 2017 to December 31, 2017, and $20.9 million for March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2018, with the remaining principal balance of the TLA Facility due on the maturity date
of February 13, 2019. We are required to repay the Existing TLB Facility in equal quarterly installments of $1.3 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the outstanding principal balance of the
Existing TLB Facility due on February 11, 2022. We are required to repay the New TLB Facility in equal quarterly installments of approximately $2.4 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the
outstanding principal balance of the New TLB Facility due on February 16, 2023.    Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement are guaranteed by each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and such subsidiaries

assets. Borrowings with respect to the TLA Facility and our revolving credit facility (collectively,  Pro Rata Facilities ) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bear interest
at a rate tied to Acadia s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as consolidated funded debt net of up to $40.0 million of unrestricted and unencumbered cash to consolidated EBITDA, in each case as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement). The Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the Pro Rata Facilities was 3.25% for Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and 2.0% for Base Rate Loans (as
defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) at September 30, 2016. Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement) (based upon the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) prior to commencement of the interest rate period). Base Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate
plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As of September 30, 2016, the Pro Rata Facilities bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. In addition,
we are required to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility.    The interest rates and the unused line
fee on unused commitments related to the Pro Rata Facilities are based upon the following pricing tiers:      
   Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Existing TLB Facility bear interest at the Existing TLB Applicable
Rate (as defined below) plus the Eurodollar Rate (subject to a floor of 0.75% and based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Existing TLB Applicable Rate plus the highest of
(i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As used herein, the term  Existing TLB Applicable Rate  means, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 3.0%, and with respect
to Base Rate Loans, 2.0%. The New TLB Facility bears interest as follows: Eurodollar Rate Loans bear interest at the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (subject to a floor of 0.75% and
based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period) and Base Rate Loans bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the
Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As used herein, the term  Applicable Rate  means, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 3.0%, and with respect to Base Rate Loans, 2.0%.  
 The lenders who provided the Existing TLB Facility and New TLB Facility are not entitled to benefit from the Company s maintenance of its
financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain its financial covenants, such failure shall not constitute an event of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to
the Existing TLB Facility or the New TLB Facility until and unless the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility is accelerated or the commitment of the lenders to make further loans is terminated.  
 The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial
covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. We may be required to pay all of our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other
restrictive covenants contained in any of its material debt agreements. We may be required to pay all of our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in any of our material debt

   Senior Notes        6.125% Senior
Notes Due 2021      On March 12, 2013, we issued $150.0 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021. The 6.125% Senior Notes mature on
March 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.

 On July 1, 2014, we issued $300.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022. The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2022 and bear
interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  
   5.625% Senior Notes due 2023    
 On February 11, 2015, we issued $375.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2023
and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.

    6.500% Senior Notes due 2024    
 On February 16, 2016, we issued $390.0 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024. The 6.500% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024 and
bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016.  
 The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability and the ability of its
restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) engage in certain
transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company s assets; and (vii) create liens on assets.
   The Senior Notes issued by the Company are guaranteed by each of the Company s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s
obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.    The
Company may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.      9.0% and 9.5% Revenue
Bonds      On November 11, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of Park Royal, we assumed debt of $23.0 million. The fair
market value of the debt assumed was $25.6 million and resulted in a debt premium balance being recorded as of the acquisition date. The debt consisted of $7.5 million and $15.5 million of Lee County (Florida) Industrial Development
Authority Healthcare Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 with stated interest rates of 9.0% and 9.5%, respectively. The 9.0% bonds in the amount of $7.5 million have a maturity date of December 1, 2030 and require yearly principal
payments beginning in 2013. The 9.5% bonds in the amount of $15.5 million have a maturity date of December 1, 2040 and require yearly principal payments beginning in 2031. The principal payments establish a bond-sinking fund to be held
with the trustee and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amounts of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds on their respective maturity dates. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2.3 million was recorded within other
assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to the debt service reserve fund requirements. The yearly principal payments, which establish a bond sinking fund, will increase the debt service reserve fund requirements. The bond premium
amount of $2.6 million is amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds using the effective interest method.  
  Contractual Obligations     The following
table presents a summary of contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands):      

(a) 
 Amounts include required principal and interest payments. The projected interest payments reflect an interest rates in place on our variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2016.    

(b) 
 Amounts relate to purchase obligations, including capital lease payments.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
    As of September 30, 2016, we had standby letters of credit outstanding of $8.4 million related to security for the payment
of claims as required by our workers  compensation insurance program.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate Risk   
 Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, our long-term debt
outstanding at September 30, 2016 was composed of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate debt and $2.2 billion of variable-rate debt with interest based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would
decrease our net income and cash flows by $5.2 million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at September 30, 2016.  
      43  

Table of Contents  

   Foreign Currency Risk   
 The functional currency for our U.K. facilities is GBP. Our revenue and earnings are sensitive to changes in GBP to USD exchange rate from the
translation of our earnings into USD at exchange rates that may fluctuate. Based upon the level of our U.K. operations relative to the Company as a whole, a hypothetical 10% change in this exchange rate would cause a change in our net income of
$12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In May 2016, we entered into multiple cross currency swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $650.0 million to manage foreign currency exchange risk by
effectively converting a portion of our fixed-rate USD denominated senior notes, including the semi-annual interest payments thereunder, to fixed-rate, GBP-denominated debt of  449.3 million. The cross currency swap agreements limit the
impact of changes in the exchange rate on our cash flows and leverage. Following the Brexit vote, the GBP dropped to its lowest level against the USD in more than 30 years. If the exchange rate remains low, our results of operations will be
negatively impacted in future periods.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting     There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 We are, from time to time, subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including claims for
damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, breach of contract, tort and employment related claims. In these actions, plaintiffs request a variety of damages, including, in some instances, punitive and other types of damages that may not be
covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, we are not currently a party to any proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, an investor should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,
 Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in Part II,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016. The Company has updated and supplemented certain risk factors previously disclosed in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as set forth below. The risks described herein and those in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially, adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.  
  An extended review of our acquisition of Priory by the Competition and Markets Authority (the  CMA ) in the U.K., including a potential phase 2
investigation, would delay our integration of Priory s business. If we are unable to complete the planned divestiture of certain of our U.K. behavioral healthcare facilities and take other actions required by the CMA on acceptable terms and
within expected timeframes, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.     We cannot
determine when the CMA will complete its review of our acquisition of Priory and, until such review is complete, we will not be allowed to integrate Priory s business. On October 18, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with BC Partners
for the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds. We currently expect the CMA to approve such sale on or before November 18, 2016, however,
the CMA may not approve the planned divestiture. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer, and our expectations for the acquisition of Priory may not be met, if we are unable to integrate Priory s business for an
extended period as a result of the CMA s ongoing review, including a potential phase 2 investigation, or if we are unable to complete the planned divestiture of certain of our U.K. behavioral healthcare facilities and take other actions
required by the CMA on acceptable terms and within expected timeframes.
