1.             Basis of Presentation   
     
  The Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. ("MDC,"  the Company,"  we,   us,  or  our  which refers to M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries) have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of MDC at September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with MDC s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in MDC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

2.             Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ("ASU 2014-09"), which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018, and is to be adopted using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We do not plan to early adopt the guidance and are currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact the update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation   (Topic 810)  : Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ), which amends the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810,  Consolidation , primarily related to limited partnerships and variable interest entities. ASU 2015-02 was effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which makes a number of changes to the current GAAP model, including changes to the accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under ASU 2016-01, we will primarily be impacted by the changes to accounting for equity instruments with readily determinable fair values as they will no longer be permitted to be classified as available-for-sale (changes in fair value reported through other comprehensive income) and instead, all changes in fair value will be reported in earnings. ASU 2016-01 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 and is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption of the applicable guidance from ASU 2016-01 is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for virtually all leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments while the right-of-use asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. In addition, ASU 2016-02 expands the disclosure requirements for lessees. ASU 2016-02 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 and is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. We do not plan to early adopt the guidance and we are currently evaluating the impact the update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  I  n March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation    ( ASC 718 ). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017, and is to be applied using a retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted.   We do not plan to early adopt the guidance and we are currently evaluating the impact the update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

  In June 2016,   the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,      Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326):     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments      ( ASU 2016-13 ), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable threshold for initial recognition of a credit loss in current GAAP and reflect an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2021, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method. Earlier adoption is permitted.   We do not plan to early adopt the guidance and we are currently evaluating the impact the update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, S tatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)    ( ASU 2016-15 ), which amends ASC Topic 230 , Statement of Cash Flows , to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are intended to reduce diversity   in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows  . ASU 2016-15 is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018, and is to be applied using a retrospective transition method. Earlier adoption is permitted.   We do not plan to early adopt the guidance and do not believe the guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.  

3.               Segment Reporting   
        
  An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ), or decision-making group, to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our CODM as two key executives the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.  
        
  We have identified each homebuilding division as an operating segment. Our homebuilding operating segments have been aggregated into the reportable segments noted below because they are similar in the following regards: (1) economic characteristics; (2) housing products; (3) class of homebuyer; (4) regulatory environments; and (5) methods used to construct and sell homes. Our homebuilding reportable segments are as follows:   

West (Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington)     

Mountain (Colorado and Utah)     

East (Virginia, Florida and Maryland, which includes Pennsylvania and New Jersey)     
       
  Our financial services business consists of the operations of the following operating segments: (1) HomeAmerican Mortgage Corporation ( HomeAmerican  (2) Allegiant Insurance Company, Inc., A Risk Retention Group ( Allegiant  (3) StarAmerican Insurance Ltd. ( StarAmerican  (4) American Home Insurance Agency, Inc.; and (5) American Home Title and Escrow Company. Due to its contributions to consolidated pretax income, we consider HomeAmerican to be a reportable segment ( mortgage operations ). The remaining operating segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment ( other ) because they do not individually exceed 10 percent of: (1) consolidated revenue; (2) the greater of (a) the combined reported profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss or (b) the positive value of the combined reported loss of all operating segments that reported losses; or (3) consolidated assets.   
     
  Corporate is a non-operating segment that develops and implements strategic initiatives and supports our operating divisions by centralizing key administrative functions such as finance, treasury, information technology, insurance, risk management, litigation, and human resources. Corporate also provides the necessary administrative functions to support MDC as a publicly traded company. A portion of the expenses incurred by Corporate are allocated to the homebuilding operating segments based on their respective percentages of assets, and to a lesser degree, a portion of Corporate expenses are allocated to the financial services segments. A majority of Corporate s personnel and resources are primarily dedicated to activities relating to the homebuilding segments, and, therefore, the balance of any unallocated Corporate expenses is included in our homebuilding operations.

4  .             Earnings Per Share        
     
  ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ), requires a   company that has participating security holders (for example, holders of unvested restricted stock that has nonforfeitable dividend rights) to utilize the two-class method for calculating earnings per share ( EPS ) unless the treasury stock method results in lower EPS. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings/(loss) between the holders of common stock and a company s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings/(loss) for the reporting period are allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective rights to receive distributed earnings (i.e., dividends) and undistributed earnings (i.e., net income/(loss)). Our common shares outstanding are comprised of shareholder owned common stock and participating security holders consisting of shareholders of unvested restricted stock. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, excluding participating shares in accordance with ASC 260  .   To calculate diluted EPS, basic EPS is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive stock options outstanding.   The table below shows basic and diluted EPS calculations:  

Diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 excluded options to purchase approximately 5.3 million and 6.4 million shares, respectively, of common stock because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the same periods in 2015, diluted EPS excluded options to purchase approximately 3.4 million and 3.9 million shares, respectively.

  The following table sets forth the activity related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities:   

6  .             Fair Value Measurements   
       
  ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements  ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

   Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   
   
  The following table sets forth the fair values and methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments on a recurring basis:  

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   
       
   Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and other receivables, prepaid and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liab  ilities and borrowings on our revolving credit facility  .  Fair value approximates carrying value.  
     
   Marketable s  ecurities .  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we only held marketable equity securities. However, during 2015, we also held marketable debt securities. Our equity securities consist of holdings in corporate equities, preferred stock, exchange traded funds and holdings in mutual fund securities (which are primarily invested in debt securities). Our debt securities consisted primarily of fixed and floating rate interest earning debt securities, which included, among others, United States government and government agency debt and corporate debt. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of our equity securities were treated as available-for-sale investments and as such, are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value initially recorded through AOCI, subject to an assessment to determine if an unrealized loss, if applicable, is other-than-temporary.  
     
  Each quarter we assess all of our securities in an unrealized loss position for a potential other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI )  . If the unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, an OTTI is recorded to the   other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities line in the homebuilding section of our   consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.   During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded pretax OTTIs of $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for certain of our equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of the end of each respective period, compared to $2.2 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  The following tables set forth the cost and fair value of our marketable equity securities:

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our marketable equity securities were in net unrealized gain positions totaling $10.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Our individual marketable equity securities that were in unrealized loss positions, excluding those that were impaired as part of any OTTI, aggregated to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million and $0.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     The table below sets forth the aggregated unrealized losses for individual equity securities that were in unrealized loss positions but did not have OTTIs recognized.   We do not believe the decline in the value of these marketable securities as of September 30, 2016 is other-than-temporary.

The table below sets forth gross realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities. We record the net amount of these gains and losses to either other expense or interest and other income, dependent upon whether there is a net realized loss or gain, respectively, in the homebuilding section or financial services section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  

Mortgage   l  oans   h  eld-for-  s  ale,   n  et.   Our mortgage loans held-for-sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, include (1) mortgage loans held-for-sale that are under commitments to sell and (2) mortgage loans held-for-sale that are not under commitments to sell. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $90.5 million and $92.6 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held-for-sale under commitments to sell. The fair value for those loans was based on quoted market prices for those mortgage loans, which are Level 2 fair value inputs. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $27.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held-for-sale that were not under commitments to sell. The fair value for those loans was primarily based upon the estimated market price received from an outside party, which is a Level 2 fair value input.      
     
  Gains on sales of mortgage loans, net, are included as a component of revenues in the financial services section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded net gains on the sales of mortgage loans of $10.0 million and $22.5 million, respectively, compared to $3.4 million and $12.2 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively.   
     
   Metropolitan district bond securities (related party).   The metropolitan district bond securities (the  Metro Bonds ) are included in the homebuilding section of our consolidated balance sheets. We acquired the Metro Bonds from a quasi-municipal corporation in the state of Colorado (the  Metro District ), which was formed to help fund and maintain the infrastructure associated with a master-planned community being developed by our Company. Cash flows received by the Company from these securities reflect principal and interest payments from the Metro District, which are generally received in the fourth quarter, and are supported by an annual levy on the taxable assessed value of real estate and personal property within the Metro District s boundaries. The stated year of maturity for the Metro Bonds is 2037. However, if the unpaid principal and all accrued interest are not paid off by the year 2037, the Company will continue to receive principal and interest payments in perpetuity until the unpaid principal and accrued interest is paid in full.

  In accordance with ASC Topic 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality  ( ASC 310-30 ), we adjust the bond principal balance using an interest accretion model that utilizes future cash flows expected to be collected. Furthermore, as this investment is accounted for as an available-for-sale asset, we update its fair value on a quarterly basis, with the adjustment being recorded through AOCI. The fair value is based upon a discounted future cash flow model, which uses Level 3 inputs. The primary unobservable inputs used in our discounted cash flow model are (1) the forecasted number of homes to be closed, as they drive increases to the tax paying base for the Metro District, (2) the forecasted assessed value of those closed homes and (3) the discount rate. Cash receipts, which are scheduled to be received in the fourth quarter, reduce the carrying value of the Metro Bonds. The increases in the value of the Metro Bonds during the past two years are based on a larger percentage of future cash flows coming from homes that have closed, which utilize a lower discount rate as those cash flows have a reduced amount of risk. The table below provides quantitative data, as of September 30, 2016, regarding each unobservable input and the sensitivity of fair value to potential changes in those unobservable inputs.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility.    The debt associated with our mortgage repurchase facility (see Note 18 for further discussion) is at floating rates that approximate current market rates and have relatively short-term maturities, generally within 30 days. The fair value approximates carrying value and is based on Level 2 inputs.  
       
   Senior Notes . The estimated values of the senior notes in the following table are based on Level 2 inputs, which primarily reflect estimated prices for our senior notes and were obtained from multiple pricing sources.

7  .             Inventories   
     
  The following table sets forth, by reportable segment, information relating to our homebuilding inventories:   

Our inventories are primarily associated with communities where we intend to construct and sell homes, including models and unsold homes (defined as homes under construction without a sales contract). Costs capitalized to land and land under development primarily include: (1) land costs; (2) land development costs; (3) entitlement costs; (4) capitalized interest; (5) engineering fees; and (6) title insurance, real property taxes and closing costs directly related to the purchase of the land parcel. Components of housing completed or under construction primarily include: (1) land costs transferred from land and land under development; (2) direct construction costs associated with a house; (3) real property taxes, engineering fees, permits and other fees; (4) capitalized interest; and (5) indirect construction costs, which include field construction management salaries and benefits, utilities and other construction related costs. Land costs are transferred from land and land under development to housing completed or under construction at the point in time that construction of a home on an owned lot begins.   
     
  In accordance with ASC Topic 360,  Property, Plant, and Equipment  ( ASC 360 ), homebuilding inventories, excluding those classified as held for sale, are carried at cost unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the underlying subdivision may not be recoverable.  We evaluate inventories for impairment at each quarter end on a subdivision level basis as each such subdivision represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. In making this determination, we review, among other things, the following for each subdivision:  

actual and trending  Operating Margin  (which is defined as home sale revenues less home cost of sales and all direct incremental costs associated with the home closing, including sales commissions) for homes closed;     

estimated future undiscounted cash flows and Operating Margin;      

forecasted Operating Margin for homes in backlog;      

actual and trending net and gross home orders;      

base sales price and home sales incentive information for homes closed, homes in backlog and homes available for sale;      

market information for each sub-market, including competition levels, home foreclosure levels, the size and style of homes currently being offered for sale and lot size; and      

known or probable events indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.      
     
  If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our inventory may not be recoverable, assets are reviewed for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from an individual subdivision (including capitalized interest) to its carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the subdivision s carrying value, the carrying value of the subdivision is written down to its then estimated fair value. We generally determine the estimated fair value of each subdivision by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows at discount rates, which are Level 3 inputs, that are commensurate with the risk of the subdivision under evaluation. The evaluation for the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets for each individual subdivision can be impacted significantly by our estimates of future home sale revenues, home construction costs, and development costs per home, all of which are Level 3 inputs.

  If land is classified as held for sale, in accordance with ASC 360, we measure it at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In determining fair value, we primarily rely upon the most recent negotiated price which is a Level 2 input. If a negotiated price is not available, we will consider several factors including, but not limited to, current market conditions, recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies. If the fair value less estimated costs to sell is lower than the current carrying value, the land is impaired down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.   
     
  Impairments of homebuilding inventory by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the table below. In addition to the impairments shown below, using Level 2 inputs, we recorded $1.1 million of impairments on our land held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. No such impairments were recorded during the same periods in 2016.  

The table below provides quantitative data, for the periods presented, used in determining the fair value of the impaired inventory.

8  .            Capitalization of Interest   
     
  We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC Topic 835, Interest ( ASC 835 ). Homebuilding interest capitalized as a cost of inventories is included in cost of sales during the period that related units or lots are delivered. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of the interest incurred. For all periods presented, our qualified assets exceeded our homebuilding debt and as such, all interest incurred has been capitalized. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of all lots and homes, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models, within projects that are actively selling or under development. The table set forth below summarizes homebuilding interest activity.   

9  .                   Homebuilding   Prepaid and   Other Assets

  The following table sets forth information relating to financial services accounts payable and accrued liabilities:  

1  1  .              Warranty Accrual   
     
  Our homes are sold with limited third-party warranties. We record accruals for general and structural warranty claims, as well as accruals for known, unusual warranty-related expenditures. Our warranty accruals are recorded based upon historical payment experience in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods. The determination of the warranty accrual rate for closed homes and the evaluation of our warranty accrual balance at period end are based on an internally developed analysis that includes known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including, among other things, our trends in historical warranty payment levels and warranty payments for claims not considered to be normal and recurring.  
     
  Our warranty accrual is included in accrued liabilities in the homebuilding section of our consolidated balance sheets and adjustments to our warranty accrual are recorded as an increase or reduction to home cost of sales in the homebuilding section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  
     
  The table set forth below summarizes accrual, adjustment and payment activity related to our warranty accrual for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded adjustments of $1.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, to increase our warranty accrual primarily due to higher than expected recent warranty related expenditures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reduced our warranty reserve by $0.2 million, while for the three months ended September 30, 2015 there was no adjustment.   

1  2  .          Insurance Reserves   
       
  The establishment of reserves for estimated losses associated with (1) insurance policies issued by Allegiant, (2) re-insurance agreements issued by StarAmerican, and (3) self-insured retentions for our homebuilding subsidiaries are based on actuarial studies that include known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including our experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix or concentration, claim severity, frequency patterns depending on the business conducted, and changing regulatory and legal environments. It is possible that future changes in the insurance payment experience used in estimating our ultimate insurance losses could have a material impact on our insurance reserves.

  The table set forth below summarizes the insurance reserve activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The insurance reserve is included as a component of accrued liabilities in the financial services section of the consolidated balance sheets.  

The adjustment to decrease our insurance reserve during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily resulted from a decrease in insurance claim payment severity and frequency relative to prior period estimates.  
     
  In the ordinary course of business, we make payments from our insurance reserves to settle litigation claims arising primarily from our homebuilding activities. These payments are irregular in both their timing and their magnitude. As a result, the cash payments, net of recoveries shown for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of what future cash payments will be for subsequent periods.   

1  3  .          Income Taxes    
     
  At the end of each interim period, we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income taxes for the current year-to-date reporting period. Our overall effective income tax rates were 30.7% and 32.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 37.5% and 37.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in income tax expense of $11.7 million and $29.9 million, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $8.9 million and $25.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The year-over-year improvements in our effective tax rates are primarily the result of our estimated 2016 full year effective tax rate including (1) an estimate for energy credits versus no such estimate as of September 30, 2015 as the credit for both 2015 and 2016 was not approved by the U.S. Congress until December of 2015 and (2) a domestic manufacturing deduction whereas we were not eligible for this deduction in the prior year due to our net operating loss carryforwards.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities, of $85.1 million and $99.1 million, respectively. The valuation allowances were related to: (1) various state net operating loss carryforwards where realization is more uncertain at this time due to the limited carryforward periods that exist in certain states; and (2) the portion of the amount by which the carrying value of our Metro Bonds for tax purposes exceeds our carrying value for book purposes, as we believe realization of that portion is more uncertain at this time.  

1  4  .          Senior Notes   
     
  The carrying value of our senior notes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net of any unamortized debt issuance costs or discount, were as follows:     

Our senior notes are not secured and, while the senior note indentures contain some restrictions on secured debt and other transactions, they do not contain financial covenants. Our senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries.

15.          Stock Based Compensation   
       
  We account for share-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, which requires the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to be amortized as an expense over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant. The following table sets forth share-based award expense activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

On May 18, 2015, the Company granted a non-qualified stock option to each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer for 1,000,000 shares of common stock under the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. The terms of each option provide that, over a five year period, one third of the option shares will vest as of each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversary dates of the grant of the option; provided that all unvested option shares will vest immediately in the event the closing price of the Company s stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, in any 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days closes at a price equal to or greater than 120% of the closing price on the date of grant (the  market-based condition ). The option exercise price is equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, which was $28.45 and the expiration date of each option is May 18, 2025. In accordance with ASC 718, the market-based awards were assigned a fair value of $5.62 per share (total value of $11.2 million) on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and, as calculated under that model, all expense was recorded on a straight-line basis through the end of the 2016 second quarter. Included in the stock based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, shown in the table above, was $0 and $5.0 million, respectively, of stock option grant expense related to these market-based option grants. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $2.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of stock option grant expense was related to these market-based option grants.  
     
  On July 25, 2016, the Company granted long term performance stock unit awards ( PSUs ) to each of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer under the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. The PSUs will be earned based upon the Company s performance, over a three year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2019 (the  Performance Period ), measured by increasing home sale revenues over the Base Period. The  Base Period  for the awards is July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The awards are conditioned upon the Company achieving an average gross margin from home sales percentage (excluding impairments) of at least fifteen percent (15%) over the Performance Period. Target goals of 100,000 shares for each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer and 25,000 shares for the Chief Financial Officer (the  Target Goals ) will be earned if the Company s three year average home sale revenues over the Performance Period ( Performance Revenues ) exceed the home sale revenues over the Base Period ( Base Revenues ) by at least 10% but less than 20%. If Performance Revenues exceed the Base Revenues by at least 5% but less than 10%, 50% of the Target Goals will be earned. If Performance Revenues exceed the Base Revenues by at least 20%, 200% of the Target Goals will be earned.  
     
  In accordance with ASC 718, the PSUs are valued at the fair value on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of these awards was $24.08 per share and the maximum potential expense that would be recognized by the Company if the maximum of the performance targets were met would be approximately $10.8 million. ASC 718 prohibits recognition of expense associated with performance based stock awards until achievement of the performance targets are probable of occurring. As of September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that achievement of the performance targets had not met the level of probability required to record compensation expense at that time and, as such, no compensation expense was recognized related to the grant of these awards during the 2016 third quarter.  

16.          Commitments and Contingencies   
       
   Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit.  We are required to obtain surety bonds and letters of credit in support of our obligations for land development and subdivision improvements, homeowner association dues, warranty work, contractor license fees and earnest money deposits. At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $179.3 million and $58.9 million, respectively, including $32.6 million in letters of credit issued by HomeAmerican. The estimated cost to complete obligations related to these bonds and letters of credit were approximately $53.8 million and $31.9 million, respectively. All letters of credit as of September 30, 2016, excluding those issued by HomeAmerican, were issued under   our unsecured revolving credit facility (see Note 18 for further discussion of the revolving credit facility)  . We expect that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related performance bonds and letters of credit should be released and we should not have any continuing obligations. However, in the event any such performance bonds or letters of credit are called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit.

   Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   
     
  We have made no material guarantees with respect to third-party obligations.  
     
   Mortgage Loan Loss Reserves.  In the normal course of business, we establish reserves for potential losses associated with HomeAmerican s sale of mortgage loans to third-parties. These reserves are created to address repurchase and indemnity claims by third-party purchasers of the mortgage loans, which claims arise primarily out of, but are not limited to, allegations of homebuyer fraud at the time of origination of the loan, missing documentation, loan processing defects or defective appraisals. These reserves are based upon, among other things: (1) pending claims received from third-party purchasers associated with previously sold mortgage loans; (2) a current assessment of the potential exposure associated with future claims of loan processing defects or homebuyer fraud in mortgage loans originated in prior periods; and (3) historical loss experience. In addition to reserves established for mortgage loans previously sold to third-parties, we establish reserves for loans that we have been required to repurchase. Our mortgage loan reserves are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities in the financial services section of the consolidated balance sheets, and the associated expenses are included in expenses in the financial services section of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  
     
  The following table summarizes the mortgage loan loss reserve activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Legal Reserves.  Because of the nature of the homebuilding business, we have been named as defendants in various claims, complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability claims and claims associated with the sale and financing of homes. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
     
   Lot Option Contracts . In the normal course of business, we enter into lot option purchase contracts ( Option Contracts ), generally through a deposit of cash or a letter of credit, for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. The use of such land option and other contracts generally allow us to reduce the risks associated with direct land ownership and development, reduces our capital and financial commitments, and minimizes the amount of land inventories on our consolidated balance sheets. Our obligation with respect to Option Contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the related deposits. At September 30, 2016, we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling $6.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, at risk associated with the option to purchase 2,504 lots.   

17.          Derivative Financial Instruments   
     
  The derivative instruments we utilize in the normal course of business are interest rate lock commitments and forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, both of which typically are short-term in nature. Forward sales of mortgage-backed securities are utilized to hedge changes in fair value of our interest rate lock commitments as well as mortgage loans held-for-sale not under commitments to sell. For forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, as well as interest rate lock commitments that are still outstanding at the end of a reporting period, we record the changes in fair value of the derivatives in revenues in the financial services section of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income with an offset to other assets or accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the financial services section of our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the nature of the change.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate principal balance of   $105.8   million. Additionally, we had   $26.8 million of mortgage loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2016 that had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser.   In order to hedge the changes in fair value of our interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale that had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser, we had forward sales of securities totaling   $88.5   million at September 30, 2016.

  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded net gains on our derivatives of $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to $0.9 and $1.5 million for the same periods in 2015.  

18.          Lines of Credit   
       
   Revolving Credit Facility.    We have an unsecured revolving credit agreement ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a group of lenders, which may be used for general corporate purposes.   This agreement has an   aggregate commitment of $550 million (the  Commitment )   and was amended on December 18, 2015 to extend the maturity to December 18, 2020.   Each lender may issue letters of credit in an amount up to 50% of its commitment. The facility permits an increase in the maximum Commitment amount to $1.0 billion upon our request, subject to receipt of additional commitments from existing or additional lenders and the consent of the designated agent and the co-administrative agent. As defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, interest rates on outstanding borrowings are equal to the highest of: (1) 0.0% or (2) a specified eurocurrency rate, federal funds effective rate or prime rate, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At any time at which our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, exceeds 55%, the aggregate principal amount of all consolidated senior debt borrowings outstanding may not exceed the borrowing base. There is no borrowing base requirement if our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, is 55% or less.  
     
  The Revolving Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The financial covenants include a consolidated tangible net worth test and a leverage test, along with a consolidated tangible net worth covenant, all as defined in the facility agreement. A failure to satisfy the foregoing tests does not constitute an event of default, but can trigger a  term-out  of the facility. A breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (but not the consolidated tangible net worth test) or a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws would result in an event of default.  
     
  The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws, failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, or another person becoming beneficial owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe we were in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016.  
     
  We incur costs associated with unused commitment fees pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $26.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amounts available to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $15.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $508.8 million.  
       
   Mortgage Repurchase Facility.  HomeAmerican   entered into an Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the  Mortgage Repurchase Facility ) with U.S. Bank National Association     ( USBNA ), effective September 16, 2016  .   The Mortgage Repurchase Facility amends and restates the prior Master Repurchase Agreement with USBNA dated as of November 12, 2008, as amended, which contained similar terms. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility increases the facility amount from $50 million to $75 million, extends the expiration date to September 15, 2017, adjusts the facility s sublimits, expands the types of eligible loans, and reduces the facility fee.   The Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides liquidity to HomeAmerican by providing for the sale of eligible mortgage loans to USBNA with an agreement by HomeAmerican to repurchase the mortgage loans at a future date. Until such mortgage loans are transferred back to HomeAmerican, the documents relating to such loans are held by USBNA, as custodian, pursuant to the Custody Agreement ( Custody Agreement ), dated as of November 12, 2008, by and between HomeAmerican and USBNA. In the event that an eligible mortgage loan becomes ineligible, as defined under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility, HomeAmerican may be required to repurchase the ineligible mortgage loan immediately. The maximum aggregate commitment of the Mortgage Repurchase Facility was temporarily increased on September 27, 2016 from $75 million to $110 million and was effective through October 26, 2016. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility also had a temporary increase in the maximum aggregate commitment from $50 million to $90 million from December 23, 2015 through January 31, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $92.0 million and $88.6 million, respectively, of mortgage loans that HomeAmerican was obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Mortgage loans that HomeAmerican is obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility are accounted for as a debt financing arrangement and are reported as mortgage repurchase facility in the consolidated balance sheets. Advances under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility carry a price range that is LIBOR-based. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include, among others, (i) a minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth requirement, (ii) a maximum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth ratio, (iii) a minimum adjusted net income requirement, and (iv) a minimum Liquidity requirement. The foregoing capitalized terms are defined in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. We believe HomeAmerican was in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of September 30, 2016.

Overview    
     
   Industry Conditions   
     
  The homebuilding industry has continued down a stable path in 2016, driven by solid levels of employment, consumer confidence, personal income and household formation, coupled with mortgage rates that remain near record lows. We continue to see increasing demand from first-time buyers for more affordable new homes, which we believe has the potential to increase the overall level of national new home sales. However, many markets also continue to see production constraints driven by limited subcontractor availability, resulting in slower build times.   
        
   Three Months Ended September 30,   2016   
     
  Our net income for the 2016 third quarter was $26.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, a 78% increase from $14.8 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement in home sale revenues of 27%, coupled with a 180 basis point improvement in our selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses as a percentage of home sale revenues ( SG A rate ), a 26% increase in our financial services pre-tax income, and a 680 basis point reduction in our effective tax rate, partially offset by a 90 basis point decline in our gross margin from home sales.   
     
  Home sale revenues were up from $454.7 million in the 2015 third quarter to $575.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. The $121.0 million improvement was primarily the result of a 20% increase in the number of homes delivered and, to a lesser extent, a 6% increase in our average selling price. Our improvement in the number of homes delivered was the result of a 35% year-over-year increase in our beginning homes in backlog. The increase in our average selling price was mostly due to a mix shift to higher-priced communities and, to a lesser extent, price increases implemented over the past twelve months.  
     
  Our dollar value of net new home orders increased 17% from the prior year period to $570.3 million, driven primarily by higher net new orders as our monthly sales absorption pace improved 15% year-over-year to 2.7, our highest third quarter absorption pace since 2005.   
     
   Nine months ended September 30, 2016   
     
  Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $62.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, a significant increase from $43.2 million, $0.88 per diluted share, for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to a 19% improvement in home sale revenues, an 80 basis point improvement in in our SG A rate, and a 500 basis point reduction in our effective tax rate.   
     
   Outlook   
     
  We ended the 2016 third quarter with a dollar value of homes in backlog of $1.61 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Though we continue to experience subcontractor availability issues, which have negatively impacted our cycle times, we expect our final quarter of 2016 to have year-over-year top and bottom line growth. This growth should help us continue to expand our return on equity, which is a key focus for us. See    "Forward-Looking Statements"    below.  
     
  Another key focus for us has been increasing the availability of our recently developed series of more affordable home plans, which are designed for the first-time homebuyer segment. We believe this segment is becoming an increasingly important part of the housing market and may be a more significant source of demand for us in future periods.   
   
  With overall liquidity of $769.5 million   and no senior note maturities until 2020, we believe that our financial position at September 30, 2016 provides us with the ability to grow operations as opportunities arise while still providing adequate protection from the historically volatile and cyclical nature of the housing market and domestic and global economies. See    "Forward-Looking Statements"    below.

Homebuilding     
     
       Pretax Income   

N/M   Not meaningful  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded homebuilding pretax income of $27.7 million, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $12.3 million. The improvement in pretax income for the quarter was primarily driven by a 27% year-over-year increase in our home sale revenues and a 180 basis point improvement in our SG A rate. The year-over-year increases in pretax income for each of our West and Mountain segments were driven primarily by higher home sale revenues of 24% and 30%, respectively, coupled with slight improvements in the SG A rate for both segments. In our East segment, a 28% increase in home sale revenues was more than offset by a $1.7 million increase in inventory impairments and higher lot option deposit write-offs, resulting in a larger pretax loss compared to the 2015 third quarter. Our Corporate segment experienced a $6.2 million improvement in pretax loss primarily due to declines in both stock-based compensation expense and other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities.   
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded homebuilding pretax income of $67.7 million, compared to $47.0 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $20.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a 19% increase in home sale revenues, coupled with an 80 basis point improvement in our SG A rate. The improvements in pretax income for each of our West, Mountain and East segments were driven primarily by increases in home sale revenues of 20%, 21% and 15%, respectively.   Furthermore, our Mountain and East segments benefited from significant improvements in their SG A rates. For our Corporate segment t  he additional $1.4 million of pretax loss was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses.  
       
   Assets   

Total homebuilding assets increased slightly at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Homebuilding assets in our West and Mountain segments increased modestly from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of incremental investments in our work-in-process inventories. The funds for these investments came from our Corporate segment, driving the majority of the $61.2 million decline in our Corporate segment s assets. The decline in homebuilding assets in our East segment is due to reduced land acquisition activity in this segment during 2016, as our recent returns in this segment have been lower than expected.

Home and land sale r  evenues   

For the 2016 third quarter, home and land sale revenues increased $122.4 million year-over-year to $578.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, home and land sale revenues increased $251.0 million from the same period in the prior year to $1.55 billion. The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year were driven primarily by increases in new home deliveries of 20% and 11%, respectively, and increases in our average selling price of 6% and 7%, respectively.   
       
   New Home Deliveries   

-29-

Table Of Contents 

The number of homes delivered for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased for nearly all of our markets compared to the same periods in 2015 as our beginning backlog for each period was up significantly year-over-year. However, the benefit to deliveries from the improved beginning backlog was somewhat offset by a lower backlog conversion rate mostly due to: (1) a higher percentage of our homes in beginning backlog being in the early phases of construction due to our renewed focus on build-to-order homes; and (2) issues with subcontractor availability in certain of our larger markets, which have negatively impacted our cycle times. Despite these headwinds, we expect to see a sequential improvement in our backlog conversion rate in the 2016 fourth quarter.   See  "Forward-Looking Statements"    below  .  
     
  For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, most of our markets experienced year-over-year increases in the average selling price of homes delivered. Our California and Washington markets each experienced the most significant increases in average selling price in both periods as both markets benefited from (1) a shift in mix to higher priced communities and (2) price increases implemented over the past twelve months. The average selling prices of homes delivered in our Nevada market declined in both periods primarily due to a shift in mix to lower priced communities.  
       
   Gross Margin   
     
  For the 2016 third quarter, our gross margin from home sales decreased 90 basis points from the same period in 2015. Our gross margin from home sales for the quarter was negatively impacted by higher land and construction costs, notably in our Nevada market, and an adjustment of $1.8 million to increase our warranty accrual, primarily in our Colorado market  .     
     
  Our gross margin from home sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 10 basis points year-over-year due primarily to: (1) $5.1 million in warranty adjustments, primarily in our Colorado market, to increase our warranty accrual while we had $0.2 million in positive warranty adjustments during the same period in 2015; and (2) a $1.6 million increase in inventory impairments. These items were mostly offset by the positive impact from a higher percentage of our deliveries coming from build-to-order sales, which typically have higher gross margins when compared to deliveries of homes that were started without a sales contract.

Inventory Impairments   
       
    Impairments of homebuilding inventory by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the table below. In addition to the impairments shown below, we recorded $1.1 million of impairments on our land held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. No such impairments were recorded during the same periods in 2016.  

The table below provides quantitative data, for the periods presented, used in determining the fair value of the impaired inventory.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

-31-

Table Of Contents 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a $1.9 million decline in general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense. The decline in stock-based compensation expense was the result of expense related to a non-qualified stock option grant made in the middle of the 2015 second quarter to each of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer no longer being required as all required expense had been recognized by June 30, 2016.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the $8.7 million increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses as a result of a higher average headcount.   
     
  Our commissions expenses are variable with home sale revenues while a significant portion of our marketing expenses are somewhat variable with home sale revenues. The increase in both periods for these line items is primarily due to our year-over-year increases in home sale revenues.   
       
   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Marketable Securities   
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded impairments of marketable securities totaling $0.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, compared to an impairment of $2.2 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The impairments recorded on certain equity securities were based on our determination that the unrealized loss on certain of our equity securities no longer met the criteria to be considered temporary.

  Net New Orders:    

* Calculated as total net new orders in period   average active communities during period   number of months in period   
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the dollar value of net new orders increased 17% and 14%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in net new orders in each period. Our net new orders in both periods were up primarily due to improved monthly sales absorption rates.   
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the $81.2 million increase in the dollar value of net new orders was primarily driven by significant year-over-year improvements in our California, Nevada, and Colorado markets. The increases in California and Colorado were primarily due to increases of 33% and 60%, respectively, in the monthly sales absorption rate, which drove a much higher net new order count. In our Nevada market, a year-over-year increase in average active communities of 75% primarily drove the higher dollar value of net new orders. The slight decreases in average selling prices in most of our markets were primarily due to a shift in mix to lower priced communities. As discussed in prior quarters, we are continuing to roll out our more affordable product. Though we are still in the early phases of this process, we have seen continued increases in the sales of this product as a percentage of our total net new orders.

Table Of Contents 

Through the first nine months of 2016, all of the markets in which we operate have realized year-over-year improvements in the dollar value of net new orders, driving a $246.2 million increase in the dollar value of net new orders. On the back of solid macro-economic factors, most of our markets have benefited from an improved monthly sales absorption pace in 2016.  
       
   Active Subdivisions:   

At September 30, 2016, we had 159 active subdivisions, a 1% increase from September 30, 2015. The year-over-year changes for nearly all our markets were primarily driven by the timing of opening new communities versus closing out older communities.

Cancellation Rate:   

Our cancellations as a percentage of gross sales for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were nearly unchanged from the same periods in 2015. While this metric can be useful, we have seen that it can be volatile based on fluctuations in sales and timing of cancellations. When analyzing cancellations over a period of three months, we have found that cancellations as a percentage of homes in beginning backlog to start the quarter provides more predictable results. In regard to this metric, our cancellations as a percent of beginning backlog for the 2016 third quarter were consistent with the same period in the prior year in all markets with the exception of Washington, which decreased significantly as a result of limited inventory and rising prices in that market.   
     
   Backlog:   

At September 30, 2016, we had 3,448 homes in backlog with a total value of $1.61 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 861 homes and $432.2 million from September 30, 2015. The increase in the number homes in backlog for each of our markets was driven by a combination of the following factors: (1) an increase in net new order activity over the last twelve months for all our markets, except Utah; (2) a higher percentage of our backlog coming from build-to-order sales, which are generally in backlog for a longer period of time; and (3) limited subcontractor availability, which has extended our cycle times in most of our larger markets.

Homes Completed or Under Construction (WIP lots):   

At the beginning of 2015, we increased our focus on build-to-order sales and started fewer unsold homes, giving our customers the best opportunity to personalize their homes. As a result, our supply of unsold homes has declined by 39% year-over-year from September 30, 2015. However, this decline was more than offset by a 35% increase in sold homes under construction or completed as a result of our higher backlog, and a 7% increase in our model homes, resulting in a 16% increase in our total homes completed or under construction.  
            
   Lots Owned and Optioned (including homes completed or under construction):   

Our total owned and optioned lots at September 30, 2016 were 14,759, down 6% from September 30, 2015. The decline in lots controlled in our Maryland and Virginia markets is primarily due to reduced land acquisition activity during 2016, as our recent returns in these markets have been lower than expected. Our total lot supply of approximately 3.1 years (which is based on our last-twelve months deliveries and is within our stated strategic range), coupled with our planned acquisition activity, will support growth in future periods. See  "Forward-Looking Statements"    below  .

Financial Services    

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our financial services pretax income was up $2.1 million, or 26%, and $3.1 million, or 14%, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. The year-over-year increases in pretax income for both periods were primarily due to our mortgage operations segment having: (1) increases in the dollar value of loans locked, originated, and sold; and (2) higher gains on loans locked and sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our other financial services segment had a slight decline in pretax income as the nine months ended September 30, 2015 benefited from a $1.5 million adjustment to reduce insurance reserves and the same period in 2016 did not benefit from such an adjustment.   
     
  The   following table sets forth information for our mortgage operations segment relating to mortgage loans originated and capture rate.  Capture rate  is defined as the number of mortgage loans originated by our mortgage operations segment for our homebuyers as a percent of our total home closings.

Income Taxes    
         
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had income tax expenses of $11.7 million and $29.9 million, respectively, both of which were based on effective income tax rates of 30.7% and 32.3%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had income tax expenses of $8.9 million and $25.7 million, respectively, which were based on effective income tax rates of 37.5% and 37.3%, respectively. The year-over-year reductions in our effective tax rates are primarily the result of our estimated 2016 full year effective tax rate including (1) an estimate for energy credits versus no such estimate as of September 30, 2015 as the credit for both 2015 and 2016 was not approved by the U.S. Congress until December 2015, and (2) a domestic manufacturing deduction, whereas we were not eligible for this deduction in the prior year due to our net operating loss carryforwards.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES    
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates such estimates and judgments on an on-going basis and makes adjustments as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates if conditions are significantly different in the future. See  "Forward-Looking Statements"    below  .  
     
  Our critical accounting estimates and policies have not changed from those reported in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
     
  We use our liquidity and capital resources to: (1) support our operations, including the purchase of land, land development and construction of homes; (2) provide working capital; and (3) provide mortgage loans for our homebuyers. Our liquidity includes our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility. Additionally, we have an existing effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue equity, debt or hybrid securities up to $1.50 billion.  
     
  We have marketable equity securities that consist primarily of holdings in corporate equities and holdings in mutual fund securities, which are invested mostly in debt securities.  
       
   Capital Resources    
     
  Our capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders  equity; (2) long-term financing, represented by our 5 % senior notes due 2020, 5 % senior notes due 2024 and our 6% senior notes due 2043; (3) our Revolving Credit Facility and (4) our Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Because of our current balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, ability to access the capital markets, and available capacity under both our Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility, we believe that our capital resources are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term capital requirements, including meeting future payments on our senior notes as they become due. See " Forward-Looking Statements " below.  
           
  We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases, whether through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  
     
   Senior Notes, Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility   
     
   Senior Notes.  Our senior notes are not secured and, while the senior note indentures contain some restrictions on secured debt and other transactions, they do not contain financial covenants. Our senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. We believe that we are in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in the senior note indentures.  
     
   Revolving Credit Facility.  We have an unsecured revolving credit agreement ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a group of lenders, which may be used for general corporate purposes.   This agreement has an   aggregate commitment of $550 million (the  Commitment )   and was amended on December 18, 2015 to extend the maturity to December 18, 2020.   Each lender may issue letters of credit in an amount up to 50% of its commitment. The facility permits an increase in the maximum Commitment amount to $1.0 billion upon our request, subject to receipt of additional commitments from existing or additional lenders and the consent of the designated agent and the co-administrative agent. As defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, interest rates on outstanding borrowings are equal to the highest of (1) 0.0% or (2) a specified eurocurrency rate, federal funds effective rate or prime rate, plus a margin that is determined based on our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At any time at which our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, exceeds 55%, the aggregate principal amount of all consolidated senior debt borrowings outstanding may not exceed the borrowing base. There is no borrowing base requirement if our leverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, is 55% or less.

Table Of Contents 

The Revolving Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The financial covenants include a consolidated tangible net worth test and a leverage test, along with a consolidated tangible net worth covenant, all as defined in the facility agreement. A failure to satisfy the foregoing tests does not constitute an event of default, but can trigger a  term-out  of the facility. A breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant (but not the consolidated tangible net worth test) or a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws would result in an event of default.  
     
  The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including breach of the consolidated tangible net worth covenant, a violation of anti-corruption or sanctions laws, failure to make timely payments, breaches of certain representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, or another person becoming beneficial owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe we were in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $15.0 million in borrowings and $26.2 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving a remaining borrowing capacity of $508.8 million.  
       
   Mortgage Repurchase Facility.  HomeAmerican   entered into an Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the  Mortgage Repurchase Facility ) with U.S. Bank National Association     ( USBNA ), effective September 16, 2016  .   The Mortgage Repurchase Facility amends and restates the prior Master Repurchase Agreement with USBNA dated as of November 12, 2008, as amended, which contained similar terms. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility increases the facility amount from $50 million to $75 million, extends the expiration date to September 15, 2017, adjusts the facility s sublimits, expands the types of eligible loans, and reduces the facility fee.   The Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides liquidity to HomeAmerican by providing for the sale of eligible mortgage loans to USBNA with an agreement by HomeAmerican to repurchase the mortgage loans at a future date. Until such mortgage loans are transferred back to HomeAmerican, the documents relating to such loans are held by USBNA, as custodian, pursuant to the Custody Agreement ( Custody Agreement ), dated as of November 12, 2008, by and between HomeAmerican and USBNA. In the event that an eligible mortgage loan becomes ineligible, as defined under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility, HomeAmerican may be required to repurchase the ineligible mortgage loan immediately. The maximum aggregate commitment of the Mortgage Repurchase Facility was temporarily increased on September 27, 2016 from $75 million to $110 million and was effective through October 26, 2016. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility also had a temporary increase in the maximum aggregate commitment from $50 million to $90 million from December 23, 2015 through January 31, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $92.0 million and $88.6 million, respectively, of mortgage loans that HomeAmerican was obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. Mortgage loans that HomeAmerican is obligated to repurchase under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility are accounted for as a debt financing arrangement and are reported as mortgage repurchase facility in the consolidated balance sheets. Advances under the Mortgage Repurchase Facility carry a price range that is LIBOR-based. The Mortgage Repurchase Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include, among others, (i) a minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth requirement, (ii) a maximum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth ratio, (iii) a minimum adjusted net income requirement, and (iv) a minimum Liquidity requirement. The foregoing capitalized terms are defined in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility. We believe HomeAmerican was in compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants included in the Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Dividends   
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid dividends of $0.25 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively.  
       
   MDC Common Stock Repurchase Program    
     
  At September 30, 2016, we were authorized to repurchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Consolidated Cash Flow    
       
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $8.9 million of cash from operating activities, primarily due to (1) the use of $88.6 million to increase our inventory from December 31, 2015, and (2) a $21.7 million increase to our trade and other receivables. These uses of cash were partially offset by net income of $62.8 million, an $18.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and $28.1 million in non-cash reconciling items.  
       
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $24.7 million of cash from investing activities, primarily attributable to the sale of $56.9 million in marketable securities, partially offset by the purchases of $28.3 million in marketable securities and $3.9 million in property and equipment.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $33.4 million in cash for financing activities, primarily related to dividend payments totaling $36.8 million. This was partially offset by net advances totaling $3.4 million on our mortgage repurchase facility.  
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
     
   Lot Option Purchase Contracts.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into lot option purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control lot positions with a minimal capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development. At September 30, 2016, we had deposits of $6.9 million in the form of cash and $2.4 million in the form of letters of credit that secured option contracts to purchase 2,621 lots for a total estimated purchase price of $267.4 million.  
     
   Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit.  At September 30, 2016, we had issued and outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit totaling   $179.3 million and $58.9 million, respectively, including $32.6 million   in letters of credit issued by HomeAmerican. The estimated cost to complete obligations related to these bonds and letters of credit was approximately   $53.8 million and $31.9   million, respectively. We expect that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related performance bonds and letters of credit should be released and we should not have any continuing obligations. However, in the event any such performance bonds or letters of credit are called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit.  
     
  We have made no material guarantees with respect to third-party obligations.

    OTHER    
   Forward-Looking Statements    
     
  Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as statements made by us in periodic press releases, oral statements made by our officials in the course of presentations about the Company and conference calls in connection with quarterly earnings releases, constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. These forward-looking statements may be identified by terminology such as  likely,   may,   will,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue,  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Report are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be considered. Additionally, information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance and risk factors that have the potential to affect us is contained under the caption  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
     
     Item        3.          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
  Our cash and investment policy and strategy is to achieve an appropriate investment return while preserving principal and managing risk. Our cash and cash equivalents may include immediately available commercial bank deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits. Our marketable securities consist primarily of holdings in mutual fund securities, which invest mostly in floating and fixed rate debt securities, and direct holdings in corporate equities. The market value and/or income derived from our equity securities can be negatively impacted by a number of market risk factors, including changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and equity markets. As of September 30, 2016, we had marketable securities in unrealized loss positions totaling $0.8 million, against which we recorded impairments totaling $0.3 million during the current quarter. For the remaining marketable securities in unrealized loss positions totaling $0.5 million, there can be no assurances that the cost basis of these securities will be recovered in the future. If we elect to sell, or are otherwise were required to sell these securities, we could be required to record losses if the market values do not increase prior to any sales. Such losses, if any, would be recorded as a component of our results of operations.  
     
  We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on mortgage loans held-for-sale, mortgage interest rate lock commitments and debt. Derivative instruments utilized in the normal course of business by HomeAmerican include interest rate lock commitments and forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, which are used to manage the price risk on fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans in inventory and interest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans. Such contracts are the only significant financial derivative instruments utilized by MDC. HomeAmerican s mortgage loans in process for which a rate and price commitment had been made to a borrower that had not closed at September 30, 2016 had an aggregate principal balance of $105.8 million, all of which were under interest rate lock commitments at an average interest rate of 3.48%. In addition, HomeAmerican had mortgage loans held-for-sale with an aggregate principal balance of $114.4 million at September 30, 2016, of which $26.8 million had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser and had an average interest rate of 3.47%. In order to hedge the changes in fair value of interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale which had not yet been committed to a mortgage purchaser, HomeAmerican had forward sales of securities totaling $88.5 million at September 30, 2016.  
     
  HomeAmerican provides mortgage loans that generally are sold forward and subsequently delivered to a third-party purchaser between 15 and 40 days. Forward commitments are used for non-trading purposes to sell mortgage loans and hedge price risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on rate-locked mortgage loans in process that have not closed. Due to this economic hedging philosophy, the market risk associated with these mortgages is limited. For forward sales commitments, as well as commitments to originate mortgage loans that are still outstanding at the end of a reporting period, we record the fair value of the derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income with an offset to either derivative assets or liabilities, depending on the nature of the change.

Table Of Contents 

We utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, our Mortgage Repurchase Facility and senior notes in our financing strategy. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but do not affect our earnings or cash flows. We do not have an obligation to prepay our senior notes prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value do not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For variable rate debt such as our Revolving Credit Facility and Mortgage Repurchase Facility, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the outstanding borrowing on the debt facilities, but does affect our earnings and cash flows. See   Forward-Looking Statements   above.  
     
     Item        4.          Controls and Procedures    
     
  (a)      Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures  - An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (principle executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer).  Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
     
  (b)  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  - There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   PART II   
       
    I    tem      1 .    Legal Proceedings   
     
  Because of the nature of the homebuilding business, we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates have been named as defendants in various claims, complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability claims and claims associated with the sale and financing of our homes. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
     
    Item      1A.   Risk Factors    
     
  There have been no significant changes in the risk factors previously identified as being attendant to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. For a more complete discussion of other risk factors that affect our business, see  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which include the following:  

Changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding and mortgage industries, which could have a negative impact on our business.       

Increased competition levels in the homebuilding and mortgage lending industries could have a negative impact on our homebuilding and mortgage operations.       

If land is not available at reasonable prices or terms, we could be required to scale back our operations in a given market and/or we may operate at lower levels of profitability.       

Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries.       

If mortgage interest rates rise, if down payment requirements are increased, if loan limits are decreased, or if mortgage financing otherwise becomes less available, it could adversely affect our business.       

Expirations, amendments or changes to tax laws, incentives or credits currently available to our customers may negatively impact our business.       

Increases in our cancellations could have a negative impact on our business.       

A decline in the market value of our homes or carrying value of our land would have a negative impact on our business.       

Natural disasters could cause an increase in home construction costs, as well as delays, and could negatively impact our business.       

Changes in energy prices may have an adverse effect on the economies in certain markets we operate in and our cost of building homes.       

We have financial needs that we meet through the capital markets, including the debt and secondary mortgage markets, and disruptions in these markets could have an adverse impact on the results of our business.       

Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning land development, construction of homes, sales, mortgage lending, environmental and other aspects of our business. These laws and regulations could give rise to additional liabilities or expenditures, or restrictions on our business.       

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to obtain surety bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our business.       

Decreases in the market value of our investments in marketable securities could have an adverse impact on our business.       

Product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly.       

Repurchase requirements associated with HomeAmerican s sale of mortgage loans, could negatively impact our business.

Table Of Contents 

Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate.       

We are dependent on the services of key employees, and the loss of their services could hurt our business.       

The interests of certain controlling shareholders may be adverse to investors

   M.D.C. HOLDINGS, INC.    
   2011 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN    
     
   PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT GRANT   AGREEMENT    
     
  The Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the   Company  ), awards performance share units (    PSUs    ) under the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the   Plan   )  to the Employee named below. This Performance Share Unit Grant Agreement (the   Agreement  ) evidences the terms and conditions of the Company s award and the PSUs constitute  qualified performance based compensation and other stock-based awards  under Sections 9 and 10 of the Plan.   
     
   A. NOTICE OF AWARD    
     
   Name of Employee:   _________________________   
     
   Target   Number of   Performance Share Units Granted  :  ____ (  Target PSUs  )  
     
   Award Date:  July 25, 2016  
     
   Performance Period:  July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019  
     
   Base Period : July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016  
     
   Performance Goal:   The award will be earned based upon the Company s performance, over a three-year period, measured by increasing home sale revenues, while maintaining a minimum average gross margin from home sales percentage (excluding impairments) of at least fifteen percent (15%) over the Performance Period (this later requirement being referenced as the   GSM Condition  ).   
     
  The average annual increase in the Company s home sale revenues will be calculated: (1) by aggregating the sum of the home sale revenues reported by the Company for the Performance Period in the Company s regularly prepared financial statements (which may be unaudited for the two quarters ended June 30, 2019) as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC   (2) dividing by three; and (3) then computing the amount of the percentage increase, if any, when compared to the home sale revenues for the Base Period in the amount of $1,974,787,000.  
     
   Vesting of PSUs:  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, PSU s will vest when the Committee has certified (which certification shall be made as soon as reasonably possible after the end of the Performance Period but in no event later than the tenth business day following the filing with the SEC of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019) that: (a) the Employee has been in continuous employment with the Company or any Affiliate up to and including the last day of the Performance Period (except as otherwise provided below); (b) the Company has filed its financial statements with the SEC for the Performance Period (to and including, the period ending June 30, 2019); and (c) the Performance Goal and any other material terms were satisfied, based on a certification the Committee has received from the Company attesting to the satisfaction of the material terms and conditions of this Agreement and the amount of the award that had been earned based upon attainment of the GSM Condition and achievement of the Performance Goal in accordance with the following table:

   100% of Target PSUs Vested    
 
   200% of Target PSUs Vested      
     
  Any fractional amounts of units or shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Any PSU s that do not vest pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement will be forfeited and canceled.   

B.   PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT GRANT   AGREEMENT    
     
  1.      Award.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, as an inducement to Employee to continue employment with the Company, the Company awards to Employee effective as of the Award Date the number of Target PSUs as set forth in the Notice of Award on the cover page of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall govern. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in this Agreement or in the Plan.   
           
  2.      Type of Award   .   This is an award of performance share units.   
          
  3.      Performance Share Units . Each PSU represents the conditional right to receive one share of the Company s Common Stock (the  Stock ), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The number of PSUs that actually vest for the Performance Period will be determined by the level of achievement of the Performance Goal.   
           
  4.      Requirements for Vesting of PSUs.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 5, Section 6, or in the Plan, and upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth in Part A (Vesting of PSUs), PSUs shall vest.  
             
  5.      Termination of Continuous Service.  If the Employee s Service terminates for any reason at any time during the Performance Period, the unvested PSUs shall be automatically forfeited and cancelled upon such termination of Service and the Company shall not have any further obligations to Employee under this Agreement; provided, however that:   

a.   
 
  if the Employee s Service terminates during the Performance Period as a result of the Employee s death or Disability, a pro rata portion of the PSUs will vest, at the time specified in Section 4 above, subject to the achievement of the GSM Condition and at least the Threshold level of the Performance Goal (based on the Company s performance as of the end of the Performance Period), determined by multiplying the PSUs that would otherwise have vested had Employee been employed on the last day of the Performance Period by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days that the Employee was employed during the Performance Period and the denominator of which equals the total number of days in the Performance Period; and     

b.   
 
  if the Employee s Service terminates during the Performance Period as a result of termination by the Company without Cause or termination by Employee for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), the PSUs will vest, at the time specified in Section 4 above and subject to achievement of the GSM Condition and at least the Threshold level of the Performance Goal (based on the Company s performance as of the end of the Performance Period), to the same extent as if the Employee had been employed through and including the last day of the Performance Period.     
              
  6.      Change in Control.  Upon the occurrence of a  Change in Control Event,  as such term is defined in the Employment or Change in Control Agreement between the Company and the Employee as in effect on the Award Date, the PSUs will become 100% vested as of the date of such Change in Control Event.   
           
  7.      Leave of Absence.  For purposes of the Award, continuous Service does not terminate when Employee goes on a  bona fide  employee leave of absence that was approved by the Company or an Affiliate in writing, if the terms of the leave provide for continued Service crediting, or when continued Service crediting is required by applicable law. However, Service will be treated as terminating ninety (90) days after Employee went on the approved leave, unless Employee s right to return to active work is guaranteed by law or by a contract. Service terminates in any event when the approved leave ends unless Employee immediately returns to active Service. The Committee determines, in its sole discretion, which leaves of absence count for this purpose, and when Service terminates for all purposes under the Plan.   

8.      Settlement of Vested PSUs . Except as other provided herein, at the end of the Performance Period, the Employee (or, in the event of the Employee s death, the Employee s beneficiary) will receive one (1) share of Stock for each PSU that vests in accordance with this Award Agreement. PSU s settled under this Award Agreement are intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the exemption for short term deferrals. Accordingly, PSU s will be settled in shares of Stock promptly but in no later than the tenth business day following the filing with the SEC of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.  
        
  9.      Tax Withholding.  The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to Employee, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld upon the issuance, vesting or payment of shares with respect to vested PSUs. The Company may withhold taxes from any payments or shares due to Employee or Employee may deliver a check to the Company. Subject to the prior approval of the Company, which may be withheld by the Company, in its sole discretion, Employee may elect to have shares of Stock withheld or to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding obligations, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company shares of Stock already owned by Employee (for at least six months or any other minimum period required by the Company). The shares withheld or delivered shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value not in excess of the minimum statutory total tax withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of the shares used to satisfy the withholding obligation shall be determined by the Company as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined ( Tax Date ). Shares used to satisfy any tax withholding obligation must be vested and cannot be subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, or other similar requirements. Any election must be made prior to the Tax Date, shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by Employee, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.   
     
  10.      Investment Representations.  The Committee may require Employee (or Employee s estate or heirs) to represent and warrant in writing that the individual is acquiring the shares of Stock for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares and to make such other representations as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company and its counsel.   
           
  11.      Continued Service.  Neither the Award of PSUs nor this Agreement gives Employee the right to continue Service with the Company or its Affiliates in any capacity. The Company and its Affiliates reserve the right to terminate Employee s Service at any time and for any reason not prohibited by law.   
           
  12.      Stockholder Rights.  Unless and until shares of the Stock are issued to Employee pursuant to this Agreement, the Employee shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares of Stock reflected by the PSU.   
           
  13.      Adjustments.  The number of PSUs granted under this Agreement shall be proportionately increased or decreased for any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Stock on account of any Corporate Event. The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in shares effected without receipt of consideration. In the event of any distribution to the Company s stockholders of an extraordinary cash dividend or securities of any other entity or other assets (other than ordinary dividends payable in cash or shares of Stock) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Company shall proportionately adjust the number of PSUs subject to this Agreement. Any fractional amounts will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of PSUs.   
           
  14.      Additional Requirements.  Employee acknowledges that shares of Stock issued with respect to vested PSUs may bear such legends as the Company deems appropriate to comply with applicable federal, state or other securities laws. No shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless there shall have been compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and other securities laws, all applicable listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, if applicable, and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery.
