  NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Nature of Operations   
   
 Duos Technologies Group, Inc. ( Company ), through its operating subsidiary  Duos Technologies, Inc. ( duostech ) is primarily engaged in the design and deployment of state-of-the-art, artificial intelligence driven intelligent technologies systems. duostech converges traditional security measures with information technologies to create  actionable intelligence.  duostech s IP is built upon two of its core technology platforms (praes i dium    and cen t raco ), both distributed as licensed software suites, and natively embedded within engineered turnkey systems. praes i dium    is a modular suite of analytics applications which process and simultaneously analyze data streams from a virtually unlimited number of conventional sensors and/or data points. Native algorithms compare analyzed data against user-defined criteria and rules in real time and automatically report any exceptions, deviations and/or anomalies. This application suite also includes a broad range of conventional operational system components and sub-systems, including an embedded feature-rich video management engine and a proprietary Alarm Management Service (AMS). This unique service provides continuous monitoring of all connected devices, processes, equipment and sub-systems, and automatically communicates to the front end-user interface, if and when an issue, event or performance anomalies are detected. cen t raco  is a comprehensive user interface that includes the functionalities of a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system as well as those of an Enterprise Information System (EIS). This multi-layered interface can be securely installed as a stand-alone application suite inside a local area network or pushed outside a wide area network using the same browser-based interface. It leverages industry standards for data security, access, and encryption as appropriate. The platform also operates as a cloud-hosted solution. 
   
 The Company s strategy includes expansion of its technology base through organic development efforts, strategic partnerships, and growth through strategic acquisitions. duostech s primary target industry sectors include transportation, with emphasis on freight and transit railroad owners/operators, petro-chemical, utilities and healthcare. 
   
 As reported previously, Duos Technologies Group, Inc. is the result of the reverse merger between duostech and a wholly owned subsidiary of Information Systems Associates, Inc., a Florida corporation ( ISA ), which became effective as of April 1, 2015 and as a result of which duostech became a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity. The merger was followed by a corporate name change to Duos Technologies Group, Inc., a symbol change from IOSA to DUOT and up-listing from OTC Pink to OTCQB. 
   
 ISA s original business of IT Asset Management (ITAM) services for large data centers is now operated as a division of the Company that continues its sales efforts through large strategic partners. ISA developed a methodology for the efficient data collection of assets contained within large data centers and was awarded a patent in 2010 for specific methods to collect and audit data.  
   
   Basis of Presentation   
     
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited condensed notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on April 1, 2016.  
   
   Principles of Consolidation   
   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, duostech and TrueVue 360, Inc. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

  CONDENSED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance on accounts receivable, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, estimates of percentage completion on projects and related revenues, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of warrants issued with debt, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of stock-based awards and valuation of loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
   
   Concentrations    
   
  Cash Concentrations  
   
 Cash is maintained at financial institutions and at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances. There were no amounts on deposit in excess of federally insured limits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
  Significant Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk  
   
 The Company, by policy, routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. As a result, the Company believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited and has not experienced any write-downs in its accounts receivable balances through September 30, 2016. A significant portion of revenues is derived from certain customer relationships. The following is a summary of customers that each represents greater than 10% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:

Geographic Concentration  
   
 Approximately 18% of revenue is generated from customers outside of the United States. 
   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements   
   
 We measure our financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Amounts recorded for notes payable, net of discount, and loans payable also approximate fair value because current interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities are substantially the same.

  CONDENSED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

We follow accounting guidance for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). 
   
 The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 
   
 Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
   
 Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
   
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use. 
   
 The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The cost basis of notes and convertible debentures approximates fair value due to the market interest rates carried for these instruments. 
   
   Earnings (Loss) Per Share   
   
 Basic earnings per share (EPS) are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, stock warrants, convertible debt instruments or other common stock equivalents. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016, outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,600,840 shares of common stock and 1,819,418 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible debt (principal and interest) were excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
   
   Segment Information   
   
 The Company operates in one reportable segment. 
   
   Reclassifications   
   
 Certain note amounts in the 2015 consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified within current liabilities to conform to the 2016 presentation. 
   
   Recent Issued Accounting Standards   
   
  In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued   Accounting Standards Update   (ASU) 2015-14   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    The ASU defers the effective date of previously issued ASU 2014-09 (the new revenue recognition standard) by one year for both public and private companies. The ASU requires public entities to apply the new revenue recognition guidance for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Both public and nonpublic entities will be permitted to apply the new revenue recognition standard as of the original effective date for public entities (annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  The Company plans to adopt this standard for their fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this ASU, but does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02:  Leases (Topic 842)    whereby lessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09:   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  -  I mprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this ASU, but does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN   
   
 As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $2,092,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  During the same period, cash used in operations was $1,518,348. The working capital deficit, stockholders  deficit and accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016 was $3,901,399, $4,915,212 and $23,043,734, respectively. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, raise additional capital and become profitable. Management embarked on a business growth strategy in 2014 to engage with private companies in or related to its market space with the intention of a merger or acquisition. In April 2015, the Company completed a reverse triangular merger whereby duostech became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The two companies are now integrated and the merged company continues to grow its business in all of the markets where they have previously operated. The Company was successful on April 1, 2016 in closing long-term debt financing of $1.8 million for the purposes of settling certain current debt and payables obligations. Net proceeds after placement agency fees, legal fees, due diligence expenses and direct payments from the lender to certain creditors of the Company were $837,891.  (See Note 3) 
   
 Additionally, during the reporting period, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new class of Preferred Stock,  Series A .  The Articles of Amendment Designating Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A were filed with State on October 31, 2016.  The Series A designated 500,000 of the Company s 10 million  blank check  preferred stock with a stated value of $10 per share, an 8% cumulative dividend payable when and if declared by the Board and a provision to convert into the Company s common stock at $0.18 per share.  If the holder elects to convert the Series A to common stock, the cumulative dividend amount will also be converted to common stock.  The Series A is redeemable by the holder after 3 years including all unconverted stated value and accrued dividends.  For shareholders who invested in previous private placements, the Company is offering on a case by case basis, the ability to convert the existing amount invested into an equivalent amount in the Series A on the condition that they invest an equivalent additional amount in the Series A.  The company continues in discussions with certain potential investors with a view to obtaining equity financing to invest in resources to support and accelerate our growth from anticipated orders and provide additional working capital. (See Note 9) 
   
 While no assurance can be provided, management believes that these actions provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern and to grow its business and achieve profitability. Ultimately however, the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to execute the plan described above, generate sufficient revenue and to attain profitable operations. These unaudited, consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

On June 30, 2015, an Addendum to Promissory Note was executed providing that the payment of $46,975, $44,325 plus accrued interest of $2,650, in connection with the Debt Purchase Agreement represents the total settlement of the Note.

The offering amount was $1,800,000 less a 5% original issue discount. The note is a senior debt obligation secured by substantially all assets of the Company and shares of all current and future subsidiaries as well as being guaranteed by each subsidiary but is not convertible into the Company s stock. The senior secured note also contains certain default provisions and is subject to standard covenants such as restrictions on issuing new debt. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued a warrant exercisable for 2.5 million shares of common stock exercisable for five years at an exercise price of $0.35 per share. The warrants also contain certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transactions as well as a potential adjustment to the exercise price based on certain events. The relative fair value of the warrants of $466,031 was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. The note will mature three years from the closing date and will accrue interest at the rate of 14% per annum, payable monthly. The note will accrue additional interest at the rate of 2% per annum, compounding monthly, payable annually in arrears. The Company may choose to begin amortizing the principal at any time subject to prepayment premiums. Also, the Company agreed to an amended placement agent s fee with respect to the placement of such loan which differed from the original terms agreed with the Placement Agent as that agreement had expired (see Note 5, Placement Agency Agreement). The amendment included (a) postponement of payment of the cash fee of $5,000 to 15 days of execution of the term sheet, (b) the closing fee was fixed to $137,000 (based on a $1.8 million debt funding) and three-year warrants for 200,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per share and valued at their fair value of $43,272.  Other closing expenses totaled $40,000 plus another $10,000 of legal fees previously paid.  Total cash issue costs of $192,000, the original issue discount of $90,000, the warrant relative fair value of $466,031 and warrant fair value of $43,272 were recorded as debt discounts to be amortized over the three-year term of the debt.  Net proceeds were $1,518,000 after all issue costs.  Additionally, at closing, certain previously recorded obligations of the Company totaling $690,110, as discussed below, were paid directly from the lender reducing the actual proceeds to the Company.  
   
 On April 1, 2016, in conjunction with the closing of the aforementioned Securities Purchase Agreement, the sum of $558,032 was remitted out of the proceeds in final settlement of the litigation with CW Electric.  This amount consisted of $550,000 of the agreed settlement plus $8,032 of accrued interest. This represents full and final settlement of this matter, which is now closed. 
   
 On April 1, 2016, the Company directed the sum of $132,078 to be paid out of proceeds of the Securities Purchase agreement to a shareholder who held a note secured against part of the Company s assets.  The payment of $125,000 in principal and $7,078 of accrued interest represents full payment of the note and the noteholder no longer holds any security against the assets. 
   
 On April 1, 2016, the Company made a payment of $142,000 (part of the $182,000 discussed above) to a placement agent as compensation for arrangement of financing through the aforementioned Securities Purchase Agreement.  The payment was deducted from proceeds of that agreement.  The Company issued 200,000 three-year warrants with an exercise price of $0.40 to the agent as additional compensation.  These amounts are broadly in line with the anticipated compensation agreed within the original placement agency agreement which was terminated in December, 2015. 
   
  NOTE 4   LINE OF CREDIT   
   
 The Company assumed a line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank upon the closing of the merger on April 1, 2015. The line of credit provided for borrowings up to $40,000, but is now closed to future borrowing. The outstanding balance under the facility as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $38,827 and $40,216, respectively, including accrued interest. This line of credit has no maturity date.

   Litigation   
   
 On or about December 22, 2014, Corky Wells Electric ( CW Electric ) filed suit in the Circuit Court of Boyd County, Kentucky, against duostech demanding relief related to a promissory note issued by duostech to CW Electric on December 10, 2008 in the amount of $741,329. The suit was subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, Ashland Division. Previously, duostech entered into a  Stipulation for Settlement  on September 30, 2009 wherein CW Electric agreed to dismiss a previous lawsuit and duostech agreed to resume payments on the promissory note. In its suit, CW Electric contended that duostech breached the terms of that Stipulation for Settlement by not making the required number of payments at the times stipulated therein. CW Electric further contended that due to the breach of payment terms, under the terms of the promissory note, the outstanding amount continued to accrue interest at the rate of 18% per annum, which compounded monthly for a total of $1,411,650 due through the future final payment date. 
   
 Effective October 28, 2015, duostech and CW Electric entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) pursuant to which the parties have agreed to settle the suit upon the payment by duostech to CW Electric of $550,000 (the  Settlement Amount ) by February 15, 2016. An agreed judgment, evidencing the Company s agreement to pay the Settlement Amount, was signed by the parties (the  Agreed Judgment ) and such document deposited into escrow with CW Electric s counsel. At the time of the payment of the Settlement Amount, the Agreed Judgment is to be returned to the Company for destruction. 
   
 Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, duostech had until February 15, 2016 to pay the Settlement Amount and, if such amount was not paid by such date, then the Agreed Judgment was to be filed with the court and executed upon, with interest due at 12% per annum beginning February 15, 2016.  
   
 On February 9, 2016, duostech s counsel informed CW Electric s counsel that on February 5, 2016, Duos executed a term sheet with an investment fund which will, among other things, provide the funding for the settlement with C.W. Electric. At the time, Duos and the lender believed that the closing would take place during or prior to the second week in March. Consequently, Duos requested that C.W. Electric refrain from filing and/or executing on the Agreed Judgment attached to the Settlement Agreement until after the closing, as they were in the final stretches of obtaining the funding necessary to resolve this matter. CW Electric s counsel agreed to an extension and following the filing of a respective joint motion, the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky entered an order of continuance until March 20, 2016 and further extended until April 20, 2016.  Payment was made in full upon the closing of the loan dated April 1, 2016.  
   
 A contingent lawsuit payable of $550,000 was reflected at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  On April 1, 2016, CW has released the Company, duostech and affiliates from any action that could have been brought in the suit. 
   
 On April 27, 2016, the holder of two convertible notes issued a notice of conversion to the Company for a portion of one of the notes. The conversion notice was determined to be invalid as was a previous conversion notice issued on the other note during the quarter. A difference of opinion has arisen between the holder and the Company as to the mechanics of conversion and the Company had been in discussions to resolve those differences.  On May 23, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against the holder. The suit alleges, amongst other things, that the officers and directors of Greentree that entered into the notes, failed to disclose legal facts with respect to their personal conduct in the past, which, had the Company known, would have made it unlikely that such transaction would have been consummated. The Company owes the principal and interest due under the notes and sought to pay principal and interest of the note which first came due, but the offer was rejected. On May 24, 2016, the Company learned through a third party that the holder had filed suit against the Company on May 12, 2016 for default on one of notes, but had not notified the Company or its attorneys, nor served either the Company or its attorneys. The Company was served shortly thereafter.  (See Note 9)

  Overview  
   
 Duos Technologies Group, Inc., formerly known as Information Systems Associates, Inc. ( ISA ), was incorporated in Florida on May 31, 1994. We are headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. Our wholly owned subsidiary, duostech is primarily engaged in the design and deployment of state-of-the-art, artificial intelligence driven intelligent technologies systems, with a focus on homeland security applications. duostech converges traditional security measures with information technologies to create  actionable intelligence . duostech s IP is built upon two of its core technology platforms (praes i dium  and cen t raco ), both distributed as licensed software suites, and natively embedded within engineered turnkey systems. 
   
 praes i dum  is a modular suite of analytics applications which process and simultaneously analyze data streams from a virtually unlimited number of conventional sensors and/or data points. Native algorithms compare analyzed data against user-defined criteria and rules in real time and automatically report any exceptions, deviations and/or anomalies. This application suite also includes a broad range of conventional operational system components and sub-systems, including an embedded feature-rich video management engine and a proprietary Alarm Management Service (AMS). This unique service provides continuous monitoring of all connected devices, processes, equipment and sub-systems, and automatically communicates to the front end-user interface, if and when an issue, event or performance anomalies are detected. 
   
 cen t raco  is a comprehensive user interface that includes the functionalities of a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system as well as those of an Enterprise Information System (EIS). This multi-layered interface can be securely installed as a stand-alone application suite inside a local area network or pushed outside a wide area network using the same browser-based interface. It leverages industry standards for data security, access, and encryption as appropriate. The platform also operates as a cloud-hosted solution. 
   
 Our strategy includes expansion of its technology base through organic development efforts, strategic partnerships, and growth through strategic acquisitions. duostech s primary target industry sectors include transportation, with emphasis on freight and transit railroad owners/operators, petro-chemical, utilities and healthcare. 
   
 ISA's original business for IT Asset Management (ITAM) services for large data centers is now operated as a division of our company that continues its sales efforts through large strategic partners. ISA developed a methodology for the efficient data collection of assets contained within large data centers and was awarded a patent in 2010 for specific methods to collect and audit data. 
   
   Prospects and Outlook   
   
  Over the past several years, we have made substantial investment in product research and development and achieved significant milestones in the development of our technology solutions. We have made progress in penetrating the market with our proprietary technology solutions, more particularly in the rail industry which is currently undergoing a major shift in maintenance strategies. We believe that this shift will be a significant motivating factor for using our technologies. We also continue to expand our IT professional audit services.   

19 

Our business success in the immediate future will largely depend on the increased penetration of our target markets for our proprietary intelligent security analytical technology solutions.       
   
  Notwithstanding the above, no assurance can be provided that our product offerings will generate the market acceptance and orders that we contemplate.   
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements included in this report. 
   
   Comparison for the Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three months ended September 30, 2015    
   
 The following table sets forth a modified version of our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations that is used in the following discussions of our results of operations: 

20 

Revenues   
   
 Revenues were $1,367,169 and $2,242,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in revenue for 2016 of $875,031 is attributable to a combination of (a) decreased project activity during the quarter amounting to $772,469 (b) decreased activity in maintenance and technical service of $46,988 and (c) decreased activity in IT asset management services of $55,574. The decrease in revenue was mainly caused by the delays in implementation of some projects by the customers and IT asset management services which were anticipated to start during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease in maintenance and service was anticipated and budgeted.  
   
   Cost of Revenues   
   
 Costs of revenues were $645,155 and $1,003,861 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in 2016 cost of revenues partially reflects the proportional decrease in project revenue as well as a decrease in IT asset management services with an offset of a small increase in maintenance and technical support expenses.    
   
   Operating Expenses    
   
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,151,607 and $1,173,915, respectively.  The decrease in administration and general expense of $50,648 in the 2016 period is mainly due to IRS late fees assessed in the same three-month period in 2015.  The increase in salaries, wages and contract labor of $72,604 is attributable to expansion of the employee base in anticipation of new projects starting later in the fiscal year.  There was also an increase in consulting fees related to new consulting agreements to assist us with our business plan for growth. The decrease in professional fees of $48,618 is mainly due to reduced legal costs compared to the equivalent quarter in 2015 which still was impacted with fees related to the merger and related filings. There was a minor decrease in selling and marketing expense of $2,103.  The increase in research and development of $6,457 is largely due to additional investment in resources. 
   
   Income/Loss from Operations   
   
 The income/loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was a loss of $429,593 and income of $64,424, respectively. The overall increase of loss from operations from the 2015 to 2016 for the same three-month period is due to the decrease in revenue and additional headcount hired earlier in the year in anticipation of additional revenue growth for 2017 and beyond. 
   
   Other Income (Expense)   
   
  Interest Expense  
   
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $161,515 and $273,750, respectively. The decrease in interest expense of $112,235 is primarily due to debt discount amortizations recorded as interest expense in 2015.  
   
   Net Loss   
   
 Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $591,074 and $209,324, respectively. The net loss increase of $381,750 was mainly due to the decrease in overall revenue and additional headcount as noted previously.  Net loss per common share was $0.01 and $0.00 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Weighted average common shares outstanding for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 66,025,986 shares and 61,831,726 shares, respectively. 

21 

Comparison for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine months ended September 30, 2015    
   
 The following table sets forth a modified version of our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations that is used in the following discussions of our results of operations: 

Revenues   
   
 Revenues were $4,018,555 and $4,953,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in revenue for 2016 of $934,609 is due to a combination of (a) decreased project activity for the nine-month period amounting to $1,184,021 (b) the decrease in revenue in maintenance and technical service of $22,406 and (c) offset with the increase of revenue from IT asset management services of $271,818. The decrease in project revenue was mainly caused by the delay of two projects which were anticipated to start during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

22 

Cost of Revenues   
   
 Costs of revenues were $1,803,523 and $2,306,034 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in 2016 cost of revenues mostly reflects the proportional decrease in project revenue.  The addition from the IT asset management services revenue added cost of revenues for that business. 
   
   Operating Expenses    
   
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,865,000 and $4,824,445, respectively. The overall impact in the operating expenses decreasing in the 2016 period from the impairment charge of $1,578,816 recorded due to the merger in the same period of 2015.  The decrease in administration and general expense of $115,680 in the 2016 period is mainly due to expenses related to the corporate acquisition prospect we pursued in the 2015 period (which was subsequently cancelled) and with an offset as operating as a public entity and in connection with the merger completed in April 2015. The increase in salaries, wages and contract labor of $675,485 is attributable to expansion of the employee base in anticipation of new projects starting later in the fiscal year.  There was also an increase in consulting fees related to new consulting agreements to assist the company with its business plan for growth.  
   
 The decrease in professional fees of $4,276 is mainly due to less legal costs. There was an increase in selling and marketing expense of $19,502 that is attributed to increase in staff and travel expenses in anticipation of additional revenue growth.  The increase in research and development of $44,340 is largely due to additional investment in resources. 
   
   Income/Loss from Operations   
   
 The loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,649,969 and $2,177,315, respectively. The overall decrease from the 2015 to 2016 period is due to the impairment charge of $1,578,816 in 2015 and lower cost of revenue in 2016.  
   
   Other Income (Expense)   
   
  Interest Expense  
   
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $443,929 and $839,962, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to less debt discount amortizations recorded as interest expense in 2016 over the same period of 2015.  
   
   Net Loss   
   
 Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,092,558 and $3,014,069, respectively. The net loss decrease of $921,511 was mainly due to the impairment charge of $1,578,816 in 2015 along with increased expenses in salaries and consulting and increase in interest expense with an offset of a decrease of general and administrative. Net loss per common share was $0.03 and $0.05 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Weighted average common shares outstanding for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 65,844,312 shares and 60,288,922 shares, respectively. 
   
   Capital Resources   
   
 A summary of our cash flows is as follows: 

23 

2016 Period   
   
  Operating Activities  
   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $1,518,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2,003,239 for the corresponding period in 2015. For the 2016 period, cash used in operating activities of $1,518,348 resulted from a net loss of $2,092,558 offset primarily by non-cash charges for stock and warrants being issued for payment of services of $125,036, amortization of prepaid consulting services of $418,119, depreciation and amortization of $35,262, interest expense related to premium/debt discounts and conversion of notes payable of $131,884 and a net negative change in assets and liabilities of $136,721. 
   
  Investing Activities

  Financing Activities  
   
 Our net cash provided by financing activities of $1,480,267 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds of $1,518,000 from notes, related party notes proceeds of $221,570 and advanced payments from stock repurchase proceeds of $140,000, offset by repayments of insurance and equipment financing, repayments of related party notes and notes payable of $399,303.  
   
   2015 Period   
   
  Operating Activities  
   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $2,003,239 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities for 2015 of $2,003,239 resulted from the net loss of $3,014,069 but was offset primarily by a non-cash impairment loss of $1,578,816, amortization of stock based prepaid consulting fees of $17,854, depreciation and amortization of $91,372, stock and warrants issued for services of $123,775, loss on settlement of debt of $197,123, amortization of stock based prepaid consulting fees of $17,854, gain on settlement of accounts payable of $3,200 and net negative change in assets and liabilities of $1,001,310. 
   
  Investing Activities  
   
 Our net cash used in investing activities of $117,525 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily the result of office equipment purchases. 
   
  Financing Activities  
   
 Our net cash provided by financing activities of $2,049,817 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable and other debt of $1,374,498, bank line of credit of $40,214, related party notes proceeds of $591,697 and insurance and equipment financing proceeds of $43,408. 
   
   Liquidity   
   
 Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our equity (or equity linked) and debt securities.  
   
 As of November 11, 2016, we had cash on hand of approximately $47,000. We have approximately $131,000 in monthly lease and other mandatory payments, not including payroll and ordinary expenses which are due monthly. More recently, on March 31, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor for non-convertible debt financing in the gross amount of $1.8 million less a 5% original issue discount.  We closed the debt financing on April 1, 2016.  Because of the growing nature of the business, we project that we will need additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. We anticipate we will need an additional $1 million for the year of 2016, which may be funded through equity instruments. 

24 

Overall, we have funded our cash needs from inception with a series of debt and equity transactions, primarily with related parties. If we are unable to receive additional cash from our related parties, we may need to rely on financing from outside sources through equity transactions. Our related parties are under no legal obligation to provide us with capital infusions. Failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on operations and financial condition, however, the recent debt transaction has lessened the overall risk in this regard. Our current level of operations require additional capital of at least $500,000. Modifications to our business plans may also require additional capital for us to operate. For example, if we have an opportunity for an accretive acquisition, it would likely require additional capital above our current need. Conversely, if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future we may need to curtail our number of product offers or limit our marketing efforts to the most profitable geographical areas. This may result in lower revenues and market share for us. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us when needed or available on terms favorable to us. 
   
 The closing of our senior secured debt financing has fulfilled part of this need.  However, ongoing interest payments to service this new debt puts an additional burden on our ongoing cash flow.  In addition, certain covenants regarding restricted issuances in the debt documents may make further capital raises more complex since without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt then outstanding we may not incur additional debt nor issue preferred stock whose terms and rights provide the requirement or option to declare and pay a cash dividend while the debt is outstanding. 
   
 On a long-term basis, our liquidity is dependent on continuation and expansion of operations, receipt of revenues, and additional infusions of capital. Our current capital and revenues are insufficient to fund such expansion. If we choose to launch such an expansion campaign, we will require substantially more capital. The funds raised from any future offering will also be used to market our products and services as well as contribute to existing working capital needs.  
   
 The Company s business model provides for revenues from projects and ongoing maintenance. As of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had a backlog of orders aggregating $3,346,372 of which we anticipate recording revenues of $2,300,000 during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
   
 We believe that our current cash resources combined with ongoing recurring revenues will allow continuing operations through the end of the fiscal year.  However, there are factors that can impact our ability to continue to fund our operating needs through December 31, 2016, including 

Our ability to execute backlog of at least $2.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016; 

Our ability to further expand sales volume with limited resources; 

Our ability to maintain product pricing as expected, particularly in light of increased competition and its unknown effects on market dynamics; 

Our ability and that of our contract manufacturers to maintain manufacturing costs and delivery times as expected; and 

Our continued need to maintain or reduce our cost structure while simultaneously expanding our business, enhancing our technical capabilities and pursing new business opportunities. 

Management continues in its efforts to raise working capital. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that these efforts will be successful, and/or that we will be able to raise the needed capital on commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital through a capital raise or revenues, it may be necessary for us to take measures to reduce our cash burn, including foregoing revenue generating projects, personnel reduction and other measures .   The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Such  going concern  qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds. In addition, any additional equity financing is likely to be dilutive to holders of our Common Stock and debt financing, if available, may require us to be bound by significant repayment obligations and covenants that restrict our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 We have no-off balance sheet contractual arrangements, as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
  Project Revenue  
   
 The Company constructs intelligent technology systems consisting of materials and labor under customer contracts. Revenues and related costs on project revenue are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35,  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts . Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and other allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are also charged to the periods as incurred. Any recognized revenues that have not been billed to a customer are recorded as an asset in  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts . Any billings of customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a liability in  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts . However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company will recognize the loss when such loss is determined. 
     
 A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred and the installation is operating according to specifications or has been accepted by the customer. 
   
 The Company has contracts in various stages of completion. Such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Costs estimates are reviewed periodically on a contract-by-contract basis throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to the profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in the accounting period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. 
   
  Maintenance and Technical Support  
   
 Maintenance and technical support services are provided on both an as-needed and extended-term basis and may include providing both parts and labor. Maintenance and technical support provided outside of a maintenance contract are on an as-requested basis, and revenue is recognized as the services are provided. Revenue for maintenance and technical support provided on an extended-term basis is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. 
   
 For sales arrangements that do not involve multiple elements such as professional services, which are of short-term duration, revenues are recognized when services are completed. 
   
  IT Asset Management Services  
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from its IT asset management business in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition  and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 985-605-25 which addresses Revenue Recognition for the software industry. The general criteria for revenue recognition under ASC 985-605 for our Company, which sells software licenses, which do not require any significant modification or customization, is that revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. 
   
 The Company s IT asset management business generates revenues from three sources: (1) Professional Services (consulting   auditing); (2) Software licensing with optional hardware sales and (3) Customer Service (training and maintenance support). 
   
 For sales arrangements that do not involve multiple elements:  
   
 (1)  
 Revenues for professional services, which are of short-term duration, are recognized when services are completed; 
   
 (2)  
 Throughout the date of this report, software license sales have been one time sales of a perpetual license to use our software product and the customer also has the option to purchase third party manufactured handheld devices from us if they purchase our software license. Accordingly, the revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software and delivery of the hardware, as applicable, to the customer; 

26 

(3)  
 Training sales are one-time upfront short term training sessions and are recognized after the service has been performed; and 
   
 (4)  
 Maintenance/support is an optional product sold to our software license customers under one year contracts. Accordingly, maintenance payments received upfront are deferred and recognized over the contract term. 
   
  Multiple Elements  
   
 Arrangements with customers may involve multiple elements including project revenue and maintenance services in our Intelligent Technology Systems business. Maintenance will occur after the project is completed and may be provided on an extended-term basis or on an as-needed basis. In our IT Asset Management business, multiple elements may include any of the above four sources. Training and maintenance on software products may occur after the software product sale while other services may occur before or after the software product sale and may not relate to the software product. Revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement is as follows: 
   
 Each element is accounted for separately when each element has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is Company specific objective evidence of selling price of each deliverable. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company allocates the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices as determined by the price of the items when sold separately. Once the selling price is allocated, the revenue for each element is recognized using the applicable criteria under GAAP as discussed above for elements sold in non-multiple element arrangements. A delivered item or items that do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting within the arrangement are combined with the other applicable undelivered items within the arrangement. The allocation of arrangement consideration and the recognition of revenue is then determined for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The Company sells its various services and software and hardware products at established prices on a standalone basis which provides Company specific objective evidence of selling price for purposes of multiple element relative selling price allocation. The Company only sells maintenance services or spare parts based on its established rates after it has completed a system integration project for a customer. The customer is not required to purchase maintenance services. All elements in multiple element arrangements with Company customers qualify as separate units of account for revenue recognition purposes.  
   
   Deferred Revenue   
   
 Deferred revenues represent billings or cash received in excess of revenue recognizable on service agreements that are not accounted for under the percentage of completion method. 
   
   Accounts Receivable   
   
 Accounts receivable are stated at realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers.  In determining the collections on the account, historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed to arrive at appropriate allowances. To date, the Company has not had the need to reserve for allowances on collections. 
   
   Share-Based Compensation   
   
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for in accordance with the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the shorter of the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award or the vesting period. The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. 
   
 Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement date . The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.  

27 

Use of Estimates   
     
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the allowance on accounts receivable, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, estimates of percentage completion on projects and related revenues, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of warrants issued with debt, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of stock-based awards and valuation of loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   
 The information to be reported under this item is not required of smaller reporting companies. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
     
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
   
 Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
   
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Report.  Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness noted below, in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

28 

Material weaknesses: due to the small size of its accounting staff, the Company did not have sufficient segregation of duties to support its internal control over financial reporting and did not have sufficient technical expertise with regard to financial reporting for publicly held companies.  We plan to rectify these weaknesses by hiring internal or external additional accounting personnel once we have the necessary resources to do so.  
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

29 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
   
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.  
   
  As previously reported, on May 23, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against, Greentree Financial Group, Inc., the holder of two convertible notes. The suit alleges, amongst other things, that the officers and directors of Greentree that entered into the notes, failed to disclose legal facts with respect to their personal conduct in the past, which, had the Company known, would have made it unlikely that such transaction would have been consummated. The Company owes the principal and interest due under the notes and sought to pay principal and interest of the note which first came due, but its offer was rejected.   
   
  Further, on May 24, 2016, the Company learned through a third party that the holder had filed suit against the Company on May 12 for default on one of notes, but not notified the Company or its attorneys, nor served either the Company or its attorneys. The Company has been served shortly thereafter. As previously disclosed, the holder of the two convertible notes issued a notice of conversion to the Company for a portion of one of the notes. The conversion notice was determined to be invalid as was a conversion notice issued on the other note during the previous quarter. A difference of opinions has arisen between the holder and the Company as to the mechanics of conversion and the Company had been in discussions to resolve those differences. The suit alleges that the Company failed to issue shares on receipt of a conversion notice and has elected to accelerate that note. A hearing on the two lawsuits was scheduled for October 26, 2016 (see Note 9, Subsequent Events)  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, there were no other pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of our operations. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    
   
 None.
