      Table of Contents           HEMCARE HEALTH SERVICES INC.     Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements     September 30, 2016        Note 1 - Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Hemcare Health Services Inc. (formerly NSU Resources, Inc.) (collectively referred to herein as  Hemcare Health Services ,  Hemcare , or the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the form 10-K have been omitted.       Note 2 - Going Concern      The Company had an accumulated deficit of $3,330,761 and a working capital deficit of $484,340 as of September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Continuation of the Company s existence depends upon its ability to obtain additional capital. Management s plans in regards to this matter include raising additional equity financing and borrowing funds under a private credit facility and/or other credit sources. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies       Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.      Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.      Prior Period Conformity      The Company has reclassified balances in the prior period financial statements for conformity with the current period for comparison purposes.       Income Taxes      The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.     At September 30, 2016, there were no uncertain tax positions that require accrual.                 7       
      Table of Contents           HEMCARE HEALTH SERVICES INC.    Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements    September 30, 2016       Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)       Net Income (Loss) Per Share      Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income, or loss, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income, or loss, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.     Because the Company reported net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, basic and diluted loss per share was the same as any outstanding instruments would have an anti-dilutive effect.       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.      Note 4 - Related Party Transactions      No salaries were paid to directors or executives during the period ended September 30, 2016.      On August 8, 2015, the Company entered into a convertible note payable for $15,784 in exchange for the related party payable incurred from expenses paid on behalf of the Company. The note carries interest at a rate of 6% per annum, was due on August 24, 2016 and may be converted into common stock of the Company at the option of the noteholder at a rate of $.01 per share. The beneficial conversion feature in the note created a debt discount of $15,784 of which $5,535 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 leaving an unamortized discount of $10,249 as of December 31, 2015 that was recognized over the remaining life of the note. There was $10,634 of principal plus accrued interest totaling $360 due as of December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made total repayments of $8,000 leaving a total principal balance of $2,634 and accrued interest of $566 due as of September 30, 2016. The remaining unamortized debt discount as of September 30, 2016 was $0.       Note 5 - Stockholders  Equity       Series A Convertible Preferred Stock      As discussed in the 8K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2014, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to designate the previously authorized series A preferred stock to series A convertible preferred stock. The preferred series A 12% convertible shares have a par value of $1, entitle holder to one vote and accrue dividends at 12% per year, paid quarterly. At the option of the holder, the stock can be converted into shares of the Company's common stock. The number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the amount of the Series A shares being converted by $0.001.     During year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 100,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock in exchange for a prepayment of royalties and purchase of 40 complete Ultroid Hemorrhoids management systems and accessories with a deemed value of $0 due to the undeterminable nature of the true future usable value to the Company. The Company also accepted the conversion notices from certain series A convertible preferred shareholders to convert a total of 138,830 shares of series A preferred stock to 138,830,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.      The excess of the value of the preferred shares issued in excess of the value of the prepaid royalties has been expensed as a financing cost.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock as repayment of $31,500 of accrued interest and $18,500 of principal outstanding on a certain note payable. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accepted the conversion of 131,170 shares of series A convertible preferred stock to 131,170,000 shares of common stock.                  8       
      Table of Contents           HEMCARE HEALTH SERVICES INC.    Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements    September 30, 2016       Note 5 - Stockholders  Equity (continued)       Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (continued)       There were 0 and 81,170 shares of series A convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Additionally, the Company had accrued dividends payable on series A convertible preferred stock totaling $25,448 and $19,000 and $0 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       Common Stock      On March 2, 2015, the Company effected a 1:50 reverse stock split. The effects of the reverse split are shown retroactively in these financial statements.     The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 275,000,000 shares and carries a par value of $0.001. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company bought back 380,000 post-split shares of common stock into treasury from a former officer for $100. The shares are being carried as treasury shares as reflected on the balance sheet.     During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company rescinded 730,000 common shares previously issued pursuant to certain agreements. The Company determined the holders did not have legal right to the shares as issued. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 138,830,000 common shares from the conversion of 138,830 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 900,000 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of $45,000 and 26,211 shares to account for rounding in our 1:50 stock split as previously discussed.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accepted the conversion of 131,170 shares of series A convertible preferred stock to 131,170,000 shares of common stock.      There were 273,332,211 and 142,162,211 common shares issued and 272,952,211 and 141,782,211 outstanding (post-split) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.      Note 6 - Notes Payable      During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a note payable with an unrelated party as a settlement for payment of consulting services provided valued at $350,000. The note carries interest of 9% compounded annually and is due on November 19, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock as repayment of $31,500 of accrued interest and $18,500 of outstanding principal. There was $331,500 of principal and $2,779 and $19,504 of accrued interest due as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Accrued interest payable is included in  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  on the balance sheet.       Note 7 - Convertible Notes Payable      During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an unrelated party resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company totaling $19,700. The note is convertible into common stock of the Company at the option of the noteholder at a rate of $0.01 per share. The Company measured the value of the beneficial conversion feature of the note and recorded a discount equal to the face value of the note on the date of issuance. The discount will be recognized ratably over the life of the note through the due date as shown below.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an unrelated party resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company totaling $16,500. The note is convertible into common stock of the Company at the option of the noteholder at a rate of $0.01 per share.

The discount will be recognized ratably over the life of the note through the due date as shown below.                  9       
      Table of Contents           HEMCARE HEALTH SERVICES INC.    Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements    September 30, 2016       Note 7 - Convertible Notes Payable (continued)       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received a $600 loan from an unrelated party. The loan carries interest at 6% annually and is due on demand. There is not an executed agreement in place for the note.      A summary of the outstanding convertible and non-convertible notes payable as of September 30, 2016 follows:            Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies      As discussed in Note 5, the Company previously issued a total of 100,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock in exchange for a prepayment of royalties and 40 complete Ultroid systems. Additionally, as discussed in Note 7, the Company entered into two separate convertible notes payable with an unrelated party. These transactions were not approved by unanimous board consent through the Company s normal approval procedures. As such, the Company may challenge the validity of these agreements after additional review of the relevant details.       Note 9 - Subsequent Events      The Company has reviewed all events having occurred subsequent to the balance sheet and determined there are no additional items to disclose.              Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  Shareholders  Equity        Plan of Operations       During the second quarter of 2014, the Company exited the Rare Earth Elements business. As part of this exit, the Company assigned the exclusive license issued from 1776729 Ontario Corporation, a related party, for rare earth extraction and carbon credit technologies to its former officer for $100, thus terminating the Company's license in the technologies. Additionally, a full and mutual release was signed by the Company and Great Rock Development Corp. pertaining to the rare earth extraction technology use as described in the Company s Form 8K filed on April 29, 2013.      On June 29, 2014 the Company was granted the perpetual exclusive rights to the use of Optimum Performance (a proprietary formulation of a highly potent all-in-one daily feed supplement for the Horse industry. In consideration for the assignment of these rights, the Company will pay a gross sales royalty of 1.5% on future sales and agreed to pre-pay royalties by the issuance of 120,000 Preferred Series A 12% Convertible shares to 2412151 Ontario Limited.     During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company shifted its business focus to hemorrhoid medical procedures and entered into a license agreement to open hemorrhoid treatment centers and promote the Ultroid Hemorrhoid System globally. In consideration for the transfer of these rights to the Company, it issued 100,000 shares of series A preferred convertible stock.       Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital      There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our assets and business have not yet generated substantial or recurring revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.      We will require additional financing to cover costs that we expect to incur over the next twelve months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding our operations as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or other securities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue and our business plan will fail.       Results of Operations            Revenues       Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0. The timing of generating revenues from the sale or the Ultroid Hemorrhoid System is presently undeterminable.                   Operating Expenses       Total operating expenses were $25,436 and $383,861 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $2,390 and $16,120 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the current period is the result of timing of professional fees incurred associated with our public filings in 2016 when compared to 2015.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of September 30, 2016 we had $0 of cash, total current assets of $378 and current liabilities of $484,718 creating a working capital deficit of $484,340. Current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 consisted of $7 of bank overdrafts, $67,655 of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $37,249 of related party payables, $25,448 of dividends payable, notes payable of $331,500 and convertible notes payable net of discounts totaling $20,225.            Cash Used in Operating Activities         Net cash used in operating activities was $26,941 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $34,332 used for the same period in 2015. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is from an decrease in operating expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.           Cash from Financing Activities       We have funded our business to date primarily from loans from directors or other related parties. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will fail.            Going Concern       Through September 30, 2016, management has devoted most of its activities to developing a market for its products and services. We have recently executed an agreement whereby the Company was transferred the rights to distribute and sell a unique hemorrhoid treatment product. We have yet to generate revenues from the sale of this product, have limited cash on hand and have a working capital deficit of $484,340 which raises substantial doubt for the entity to be able to continue as a going concern.            Future Financing       We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned operations.                  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.            Lawsuits       To management s knowledge there is no pending, or threatened lawsuit against the Company         Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, and under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that these controls are not effective considering the level and nature of the Company s operations and the number and types of transactions concluded by the Company.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      During the period covered by this report management of the Company was expanded to include more than one individual. As such, there were significant changes in our internal controls during the period. For example, for the time being and until the operations of the company make this impractical all financial transactions involving the Company, including all payments and all agreed upon incurrences of liabilities, require a signature from, or other approval from, the CEO or CFO of Hemcare Health Services. Notwithstanding these changes, as the company was previously a shell company owned and managed by one person, management has no reason to believe that the internal controls in place at that time were insufficient. Furthermore, management believes that until the operations of the Company progress to the point where tight control impedes smooth operations, it will be appropriate and sufficient (from the perspective of internal controls over financial reporting) if approval of the CEO and CFO is required for transactions that are or are reasonably likely to require disclosure in the financial statements.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings and, to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or pending.          Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       None.
