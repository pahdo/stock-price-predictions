  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (unaudited)      1. Business   
  Overview     ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc., which is referred to
herein as  ZIOPHARM  or the  Company,  is a biopharmaceutical company seeking to acquire, develop and commercialize, on its own or with partners, a diverse portfolio of cancer therapies that address unmet medical needs.  
 The Company s operations to date have consisted primarily of raising capital and conducting research and development. The Company s fiscal year ends
on December 31.    The Company has operated at a loss since its inception in 2003 and has minimal revenues. The Company anticipates that its
losses will continue for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2016, the Company s accumulated deficit was approximately $646.8 million. The Company s ability to continue operations after its current cash resources are
exhausted depends on its ability to obtain additional financing or to achieve profitable operations, as to which no assurances can be given. Cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the Company s focus
and direction of its research and development programs, competitive and technical advances, patent developments, regulatory changes or other developments. Additional financing will be required to continue operations after the Company exhausts
its current cash resources and to continue its long-term plans for clinical trials and new product development. There can be no assurance that any such financing can be obtained by the Company, or if obtained, what the terms thereof may be, or that
any amount that the Company is able to raise will be adequate to support the Company s working capital requirements until it achieves profitable operations. 
  Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures required by generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.    It is management s
opinion that the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The unaudited interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed
with the SEC on February 24, 2016, or the Form 10-K.    The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements but does not
include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.    The results disclosed in the statements of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.     Use
of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

   1. Business   (continued)   
   
  The Company s most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its financial
statements are:      

Clinical trial expenses;        

Collaboration agreements;        

Fair value measurements for stock-based compensation and Series 1 preferred stock; and

Company did not have any material subsequent events that impacted its financial statements or disclosures.    2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies     The Company s significant accounting policies were identified in the Company s Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in
those policies since the filing of its Form 10-K.

   3. Fair Value Measurements   
 The Company accounts for its financial assets and liabilities using fair value measurements. The authoritative accounting guidance defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to
measure fair value as follows:      

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        

Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.        

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.    
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

The cash equivalents represent deposits in a short term United States treasury money market mutual fund quoted in an active
market and classified as a Level 1 asset.    As discussed further in Notes 5 and 8, the Company issued Intrexon Corporation, or Intrexon, 100,000 shares of
the Company s Series 1 preferred stock, a new class of preferred stock authorized by the Company s board of directors, in consideration of the parties entering into a Third Amendment to Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement, or the 2016 ECP
Amendment, amending their existing Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement, effective January 6, 2011 and as amended to date, which the Company refers to as the Channel Agreement, and an Amendment to Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, or
the 2016 GvHD Amendment, amending their existing Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, effective September 28, 2015, which the Company refers to as the GvHD Agreement.  
 At June 30, 2016, the Company s Series 1 preferred stock was valued using a probability-weighted approach and a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Additionally, the monthly dividends issued on the outstanding Series 1 preferred stock are valued using a similar probability-weighted approach and a Monte Carlo simulation model. However, there is no adjustment or further revaluation after the
initial valuation.    The Company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of a conversion option and a redemption feature associated with the
Company s Series 1 preferred stock issued in connection with the 2016 ECP Amendment and 2016 GvHD Amendment with Intrexon amending the Channel Agreement entered into on June 29, 2016 that have been bifurcated from the Series 1 preferred
stock and are accounted for as derivative liabilities at fair value. The preferred stock derivative liabilities were valued using a probability-weighted approach and a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was
estimated using the  with  and  without  method where the preferred stock was first valued with all of its features ( with  scenario) and then without derivatives subject to the valuation analysis ( without 
scenario). The fair value of the derivatives was then estimated as the difference between the fair value of the preferred stock in the  with  scenario and the preferred stock in the  without  scenario. See Note 5 for
additional disclosures on the 2016 ECP and 2016 GvHD Amendments and Note 8 for additional disclosure on the rights and preferences of the Series 1 preferred stock and valuation methodology.  
  4. Net Loss per Share     Basic net loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company s potential dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, unvested restricted stock and preferred
stock, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for any of the periods presented as the result would be anti-dilutive. Such potential shares of common stock at September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the
following:

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)       

   4. Net Loss per Share   (continued)   
   
  The Series 1 preferred stock automatically converts into shares of common stock upon the date the first
approval in the United States of (i) a ZIOPHARM Product, as defined in and developed under the Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement dated as of January 6, 2011 and as amended from time to time, by and between the Company and Intrexon, or
(ii) a Product, as defined in and developed under the Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement dated September 28, 2015 and as amended from time to time, by and between the Company and Intrexon, or (iii) a Product as defined in and
developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement dated March 27, 2015 and as amended from time to time, by and among Intrexon, ARES TRADING, S.A. and the Company, is publicly announced. Assuming a conversion event date of
September 30, 2016, the Series 1 preferred stock would convert into 22,564,685 shares of common stock using the greater of (i) the volume weighted average closing price of the Company s Common Stock as reported by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, LLC over previous the 20 trading days ending on the conversion event date or (ii) $1.00 per share. See Note 5 and Note 8 for additional disclosure regarding the 2016 ECP and 2016 GvHD Amendments, valuation methodology and significant
assumptions.     5. Commitments and Contingencies   
  Operating Leases     Prior to December 31, 2012, the
Company entered into an operating lease in New York, NY for office space. In accordance with this agreement, the Company entered into a letter of credit in the amount of $388 thousand, naming the Company s landlord as beneficiary. In January
2012, the Company amended the lease agreement, adding additional office space. The collateral for the letter of credit is restricted cash and recorded in other non-current assets on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The lease for office space in New York, NY expires in October 2018.    On October 17, 2013, the Company entered into a sublease
agreement to lease all of its New York office space to a subtenant. The Company remains primarily liable to pay rent on the original lease. The Company recorded a loss on the sublease in the amount of $729 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2013, representing the remaining contractual obligation of $2.3 million, less $1.6 million in payments from its subtenant. The Company retired assets as a result of this sublease with a net book value of $392 thousand, and recorded
a loss on disposal of fixed assets for the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company continues to maintain the $388 thousand letter of credit in respect of the New York office space and recorded in other non-current assets
on the balance sheets.    Prior to December 31, 2012, the Company entered into separate operating lease agreements for various spaces in a building in
Boston, MA. In June 2012, the Company re-negotiated a master lease for the entire Boston office space that incorporated all three lease agreements under the same master agreement which originally expired in August 2016. On December 21, 2015 and
April 15, 2016, the Company renewed the sublease for the Company s corporate headquarters in Boston, MA through August 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a total security deposit of $128 thousand is
included in deposits on the balance sheet.    Total rent expense was approximately $109 thousand and $231 thousand for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively and $104 thousand and $581 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.    The
Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a liability for deferred rent at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $340 thousand ($177 thousand current and
$163 thousand long-term) and $661 thousand ($348 thousand current and $313 thousand long-term), respectively, which is recorded in deferred rent on the balance sheets.

   5. Commitments and Contingencies   (continued)   
   
   License Agreements   
  Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement with Intrexon Corporation for the Cancer Programs   
 On January 6, 2011, the Company entered into the Channel Agreement with Intrexon that governs a  channel partnering  arrangement in which the
Company uses Intrexon s technology to research, develop and commercialize products in which DNA is administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer, which the Company
collectively refers to as the Cancer Program. This Channel Agreement establishes committees comprised of representatives of the Company and Intrexon that govern activities related to the Cancer Program in the areas of project establishment,
chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical and regulatory matters, commercialization efforts and intellectual property.    The Channel Agreement grants
the Company a worldwide license to use patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to humans for
expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer, which is collectively referred to as the ZIOPHARM Products. Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or
other commercialization of ZIOPHARM Products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company may not sublicense these rights without Intrexon s written consent.  
 Under the Channel Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, the Company is responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Cancer Program,
including the development, commercialization and certain aspects of manufacturing of ZIOPHARM Products. Intrexon is responsible for establishing manufacturing capabilities and facilities for the bulk manufacture of products developed under the
Cancer Program, certain other aspects of manufacturing and costs of discovery-stage research with respect to platform improvements and costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of Intrexon s patents.  
 Subsequent to the Third Amendment to the Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement, or the 2016 ECP Amendment, discussed below, and subject to certain expense
allocations and other offsets provided in the Channel Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Intrexon on a quarterly basis 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of ZIOPHARM Products, calculated on a ZIOPHARM Product-by-
ZIOPHARM Product basis. The Company likewise agreed to pay Intrexon on a quarterly basis 50% of revenue obtained in that quarter from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. In addition, in partial consideration for each
party s execution and delivery of the Channel Agreement, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Intrexon.    Upon termination of the
Channel Agreement, the Company may continue to develop and commercialize any ZIOPHARM Product that, at the time of termination:      

Is being commercialized by the Company;        

Has received regulatory approval;        

Is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority; or        

Is the subject of at least an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (in the case of a termination by Intrexon due to an uncured breach or a voluntary termination by the Company), or an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in the
field (in the case of a termination by the Company due to an uncured breach or a termination by Intrexon following an unconsented assignment by the Company or its election not to pursue development of a Superior Therapy (as defined in the Channel
Agreement)).      The Company s obligation to pay 20% of net profits or revenue described above with respect to these  retained 
products will survive termination of the Channel Agreement.

   Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with Intrexon Corporation for Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GvHD)
    On September 28, 2015, the Company entered into the GvHD Agreement with Intrexon, whereby the Company will use Intrexon s technology
directed towards  in vivo  expression of effectors to research, develop and commercialize products for use in the treatment or prevention of graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD. GVHD may occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in which
someone receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. The new, transplanted cells regard the recipient s body as foreign. When this happens, the newly transplanted cells attack the recipient s body.  
 The exclusive collaboration, or the GvHD Program, will focus on the pursuit of the following engineered cell therapy strategies, used either separately or in
combination, for the targeted treatment of GvHD: (i) the infusion of regulatory T cells expressing membrane-bound and/or soluble interleukin-2 and (ii) the deployment of orally delivered, genetically modified  L. lactis  that express
interleukin-2 to modulate immune function. The GvHD Agreement establishes committees comprised of Company and Intrexon representatives that will govern activities related to the GvHD Program in the areas of project establishment, chemistry,
manufacturing and controls, clinical and regulatory matters, commercialization activities and intellectual property.    The GvHD Agreement grants the
Company a worldwide license to use specified patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products developed under the GvHD Program, or the
Products. Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of the Products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company may not sublicense the
rights described without Intrexon s written consent.    Under the GvHD Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, the Company is responsible for,
among other things, the performance of the GvHD Program including development, commercialization and certain aspects of manufacturing of the Products. Among other things, Intrexon is responsible for the costs of establishing manufacturing
capabilities and facilities for the bulk manufacture of the Products, certain other aspects of manufacturing, costs of discovery-stage research with respect to platform improvements and costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of Intrexon s
patents.    The Company paid Intrexon a technology access fee of $10.0 million in cash in October 2015 and will reimburse Intrexon for all research and
development costs. Subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the GvHD Agreement, the GvHD Agreement also provides for equal sharing of the profits derived from the sale of the Products.  
 The Company has determined that the rights acquired in the GvHD Agreement represent in-process research and development with no alternative future use.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $10.0 million to research and development expense in September 2015.    During the first 24 months after
September 28, 2015, the GvHD Agreement may be terminated by (i) either party in the event of a material breach by the other, except for the failure of the other party to use diligent efforts or to comply with any diligence obligations set
forth in the GvHD Agreement and (ii) Intrexon under certain circumstances if the Company assigns its rights under the GvHD Agreement without Intrexon s consent. Following such twenty-four-month period, Intrexon may also terminate the
GvHD Agreement if the Company elects not to pursue the development of the GvHD Program identified by Intrexon that is a  Superior Therapy,  as such term is defined in the GvHD Agreement. Also following such period, the Company may
voluntarily terminate the GvHD Agreement upon 90 days  written notice to Intrexon.

  Upon termination of the GvHD Agreement, the Company may continue to develop and commercialize any Product
that, at the time of termination:      

is being commercialized by the Company,        

has received regulatory approval,        

is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority, or       

is the subject of at least an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (in the case of a termination by Intrexon due to a Company uncured breach or a voluntary termination by the Company), or an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial (in
the case of a termination by the Company due to an Intrexon uncured breach or a termination by Intrexon following an unconsented assignment by the Company or the Company s election not to pursue development of a Superior Therapy).
     The Company s obligation to pay 20% of net profits or revenue with respect to these  retained  products will survive
termination of the GvHD Agreement.     Amendment of Collaborations with Intrexon   
 On March 27, 2015, the Company and Intrexon entered into an Exclusive Channel Partner Amendment, or ECP Amendment, amending the Channel Agreement. The ECP
Amendment modifies the scope of the parties  collaboration under the Channel Agreement in connection with the Ares Trading Agreement discussed below. Pursuant to the ECP Amendment, the chimeric antigen receptor T cell products to be developed
and commercialized pursuant to the Ares Trading Agreement shall be included within the Intrexon/ZIOPHARM collaboration under the Channel Agreement. The ECP Amendment provides that Intrexon will pay to the Company fifty percent of all payments
Intrexon receives for upfronts, milestones and royalties under the Ares Trading Agreement.    On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into (1) the
2016 ECP Amendment with Intrexon amending the Channel Agreement, and (2) the 2016 GvHD Amendment, amending the GvHD Agreement. The 2016 ECP Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that the Company will pay to Intrexon under the Channel
Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of ZIOPHARM Products, calculated on a ZIOPHARM Product-by-ZIOPHARM Product basis, subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided
in the Channel Agreement. The 2016 GvHD Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that the Company will pay to Intrexon under the GvHD Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of Products (as
defined in the GvHD Agreement), subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the GvHD Agreement. The reductions in the royalty percentages provided by the 2016 ECP Amendment and the 2016 GvHD Amendment do not apply to
sublicensing revenue or royalties under the Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement, nor do they apply to any royalties or other payments made with respect to sublicensing revenue from the Company s existing collaboration Ares Trading S.A., or
Ares Trading, a subsidiary of the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.    In consideration for the execution and delivery of the
2016 ECP Amendment and the 2016 GvHD Amendment, the Company agreed to issue to Intrexon 100,000 shares of its Series 1 preferred stock. Each share of the Company s Series 1 preferred stock has a stated value of $1,200, subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization, and certain other rights, preferences, privileges and obligations (Note 8).

   License Agreement The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center   
 On January 13, 2015, the Company, together with Intrexon, entered into a License Agreement, or the MD Anderson License, with The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson. Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, the Company and Intrexon hold an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, non-viral gene transfer systems, genetic modification and/or propagation of immune cells and other cellular therapy approaches, Natural Killer, or NK Cells and T-cell receptors, or TCR s arising from the
laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who became the Chief Executive Officer of the Company on May 7, 2015 and was formerly a tenured professor of pediatrics at MD Anderson and now currently a visiting scientist under that
institution s policies, as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under certain related technologies.    Pursuant to the terms of the MD
Anderson License, MD Anderson received consideration consisting of $50.0 million in shares of the Company s common stock (or 10,124,561 shares), and $50.0 million in shares of Intrexon s common stock, in each case based on a trailing 20
day volume weighted average of the closing price of the Company s and Intrexon s common stock ending on the date prior to the announcement of the entry into the MD Anderson License, collectively referred to as the License Shares, pursuant
to the terms of the License Shares Securities Issuance Agreement described below. The License Shares were issued to MD Anderson on March 11, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License.  
 On January 9, 2015, in order to induce MD Anderson to enter into the MD Anderson License on an accelerated schedule, the Company and Intrexon entered
into a letter agreement, or the Letter Agreement, pursuant to which MD Anderson received consideration of $7.5 million in shares of the Company s common stock (or 1,597,602 shares), and $7.5 million in shares of Intrexon s common stock, in
each case based on a trailing 20 day volume weighted average of the closing price of the Company s and Intrexon s common stock ending on the date prior to the execution of the Letter Agreement, collectively referred to as the Incentive
Shares, in the event that the MD Anderson License was entered into on or prior to 8:00 am Pacific Time on January 14, 2015. The Incentive Shares were issued to MD Anderson on March 11, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the Incentive Shares
Securities Issuance Agreement described below.    On August 17, 2015, the Company, Intrexon and MD Anderson entered into a research and development
agreement, or the Research and Development Agreement, to formalize the scope and process for the transfer by MD Anderson, pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License, of certain existing research programs and related technology rights, as well
as the terms and conditions for future collaborative research and development of new and ongoing research programs.

   5. Commitments and Contingencies   (continued)   
   
  Pursuant to the Research and Development Agreement, the Company, Intrexon and MD Anderson have agreed to form
a joint steering committee that will oversee and manage the new and ongoing research programs. As provided under the MD Anderson License, the Company will provide funding for research and development activities in support of the research programs
under the Research and Development Agreement for a period of three years and in an amount of no less than $15.0 million and no greater than $20.0 million per year. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company made one quarterly
payment of $3.8 million and has paid an aggregate of $22.5 million under this arrangement. As of September 30, 2016, MD Anderson has used $2.7 million to offset costs incurred pursuant to the MD Anderson License and the Research and Development
Agreement. The net balance of $19.8 million is included in other current assets at September 30, 2016.    The term of the MD Anderson License expires
on the last to occur of (a) the expiration of all patents licensed thereunder, or (b) the twentieth anniversary of the date of the License; provided, however, that following the expiration of the term of the MD Anderson License, the
Company and Intrexon shall then have a fully-paid up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable license to use the licensed intellectual property thereunder. After ten years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a
90-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to convert the MD Anderson License into a non-exclusive license if the Company and Intrexon are not using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed intellectual property on a
case-by-case basis. After five years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 180-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to terminate the MD Anderson License with respect to specific technology(ies) funded by the
government or subject to a third party contract if the Company and Intrexon are not meeting the diligence requirements in such funding agreement or contract, as applicable. MD Anderson may also terminate the agreement with written notice upon
material breach by the Company and Intrexon, if such breach has not been cured within 60 days of receiving such notice. In addition, the MD Anderson License will terminate upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events for both the Company and
Intrexon and may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of the Company, Intrexon and MD Anderson.    In connection with the License and the issuance
of the License Shares and the Incentive Shares, on January 13, 2015, the Company and MD Anderson entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a
 resale  registration statement, or the Registration Statement, registering the resale of the License Shares, the Incentive Shares and any other shares of the Company s common stock held by MD Anderson on the date that the
Registration Statement is filed Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is obligated to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until all securities therein are sold or are otherwise can be sold pursuant to Rule 144,
without any restrictions. A prospectus supplement under the Company s already effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-201826) was filed on April 1, 2015 in satisfaction of the Company s obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement.    The Company has determined that the rights acquired in the MD Anderson License represent in process research and
development with no alternative future use. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $67.3 million to research and development expense in 2015, representing the fair value of the 11,722,163 shares of its common stock on the date the MD Anderson
License was executed.

   Ares Trading License and Collaboration Agreement   
 On March 27, 2015, the Company and Intrexon signed a worldwide License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Ares Trading Agreement, with Ares Trading S.A.,
or Ares Trading, a subsidiary of the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, through which the parties established a collaboration for the research and development and commercialization of certain products for the prophylactic,
therapeutic, palliative or diagnostic use for cancer in humans.    Under the collaboration, Ares Trading has elected two CAR +  T targets for which the Company will perform certain research activities that will, in part, be funded by Ares Trading. Once these candidates reach investigational new drug (IND) stage, the
programs will be transferred to Ares Trading for clinical development and commercialization. The Company expects to perform multiple preclinical development programs, each consisting of the development of one product candidate, pursuant to the
agreement. The Company and Intrexon will also independently conduct research and development on other CAR +  T candidates, with Ares Trading having the opportunity during clinical development to
opt-in to these candidates for additional payments to the Company and Intrexon.    Intrexon is entitled to receive $5.0 million payable in equal quarterly
installments over two years for each identified product candidate, which will be used to fund discovery work. The Company will be responsible for costs exceeding the quarterly installments and all other costs of the preclinical research and
development.    Ares Trading paid a non-refundable upfront fee of $115.0 million to Intrexon as consideration for entry into the Ares Trading Agreement.
Pursuant to the ECP Amendment, the Company was entitled to receive 50% of the upfront fee, or $57.5 million, which the Company received from Intrexon in July 2015.  
 The Ares Trading Agreement provides for up to $413.0 million of potential payments for certain development and commercial milestones for each
product candidate, and royalties ranging from the lower-single digits to the low-teens of net sales derived from the sale of products developed under agreement. The Ares Trading Agreement also provides for up to $50.0 million of payments
upon the achievement of certain technical milestones. Intrexon will pay 50% of all milestone and royalty payments that it receives under the Ares Trading Agreement to the Company pursuant to the ECP Amendment.  
 The term of the Ares Trading Agreement commenced in May 2015 and may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach as defined in the
agreement and may be terminated voluntarily by Ares Trading upon 90 days written notice to the Company.    The Company considered FASB Accounting Standards
Codification 605-25,  Multiple-Element Arrangements , in evaluating the appropriate accounting for the Ares Trading Agreement. In accordance with this guidance, the Company identified the license and research and development services as the
Company s deliverables in the arrangement. The Company concluded that the license does not have standalone value independent from the research and development services. Accordingly, the Ares Trading Agreement is accounted for by the Company as
a single unit of accounting. The $57.5 million upfront payment received by the Company was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the estimated period of performance of the research and development services which are currently
estimated to be 9 years, beginning with the commencement of the research and development services. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $1.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of revenue related
to the Ares Trading Agreement. The remaining balance of deferred revenue associated with the upfront payment was $49.5 million, of which $6.4 million is current and $43.1 million is classified as long term at September 30, 2016.

   Patent and Technology License Agreement The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the
Texas A M University System.     On August 24, 2004, the Company entered into a patent and technology license agreement with The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Texas A M University System, which the Company refers to, collectively, as the Licensors. Under this agreement, the Company was granted an exclusive, worldwide license to rights (including rights to U.S.
and foreign patent and patent applications and related improvements and know-how) for the manufacture and commercialization of two classes of organic arsenicals (water- and lipid-based) for human and animal use. The class of water-based organic
arsenicals includes darinaparsin.    The Company issued options to purchase 50,222 shares outside of the Company s stock option plans following the
successful completion of certain clinical milestones, of which 37,666 have vested. The remaining 12,556 shares vested upon enrollment of the first patient in a multi-center pivotal clinical trial i.e. a human clinical trial intended to provide the
substantial evidence of efficacy necessary to support the filing of an approvable New Drug Application, or NDA. An expense of $87 thousand was charged to research and development expense for the vesting event which occurred in March 2016. This trial
was initiated by Solasia Pharma K.K., or Solasia, on March 28, 2016 and triggered a $1.0 million milestone payment to the Company from Solasia which was received in May 2016. An equivalent milestone payment of $1.0 million was made to MD
Anderson. In addition, the Licensors are entitled to receive certain milestone payments. The Company may be required to make additional payments upon achievement of certain other milestones in varying amounts which on a cumulative basis could total
up to an additional $4.5 million. In addition, the Licensors are entitled to receive single digit percentage royalty payments on sales from a licensed product and will also be entitled to receive a portion of any fees that the Company may receive
from a possible sublicense under certain circumstances.

   Collaboration Agreement with Solasia Pharma K.K.   
 On March 7, 2011, the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Solasia. Pursuant to the License and Collaboration Agreement, the
Company granted Solasia an exclusive license to develop and commercialize darinaparsin in both IV and oral forms and related organic arsenic molecules, in all indications for human use in a pan-Asian/Pacific territory comprised of Japan, China, Hong
Kong, Macau, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand.    As consideration for the
license, the Company received an upfront payment of $5.0 million to be used exclusively for further clinical development of darinaparsin outside of the pan-Asian/Pacific territory, and will be entitled to receive additional payments of up to $32.5
million in development-based milestones and up to $53.5 million in sales-based milestones. The Company will also be entitled to receive double digit royalty payments from Solasia based upon net sales of licensed products in the applicable
territories, once commercialized, and a percentage of sublicense revenues generated by Solasia. The $5.0 million upfront payment received in March 2011 was amortized over the period of the Company s research and development effort, which was
completed in March 2016.    On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the License and Collaboration Agreement granting
Solasia an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize darinaparsin, and related organoarsenic molecules, in both intravenous and oral forms in all indications for human use. In exchange, the Company will be eligible to receive from
Solasia development-and sales-based milestones, a royalty on net sales of darinaparsin, once commercialized, and a percentage of any sublicense revenues generated by Solasia.  
 Solasia will be responsible for all costs related to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of darinaparsin. The Company s Licensors, as
defined in the agreement, will receive a portion of all milestone and royalty payments made by Solasia to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Company s license agreement with the Licensors.

substantial evidence of efficacy necessary to support the filing of an application for an NDA for darinaparsin in certain of the territories assigned to Solasia. The initiation of the trial on March 28, 2016 triggered a $1.0 million milestone
payment from Solasia to the Company which was received in May 2016. The Company subsequently made an equivalent payment to MD Anderson as the ultimate licensor of darinaparsin.  
  License Agreement with Baxter Healthcare S.A.     On
November 3, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement for indibulin and a License Agreement to proprietary nanosuspension technology with affiliates of Baxter Healthcare S.A. The purchase included the entire indibulin
intellectual property portfolio as well as existing drug substance and capsule inventories. Additional payments of $250 thousand each are due in November 2016 and 2017. The terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement included an upfront cash payment and
an additional payment for existing inventory. No payments were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company is not actively pursuing the development of indibulin.  
  6. Related Party Transactions       Collaborations with
Intrexon      On January 6, 2011, the Company entered into the Channel Agreement with Intrexon (see Note 5). A director of the Company, Randal J.
Kirk, is the CEO, a director, and the largest stockholder of Intrexon.    On February 3, 2015, Intrexon purchased 1,440,000 shares of common stock in
the Company s public offering upon the same terms as others that participated in the offering.    On March 27, 2015, the Company and Intrexon
entered into a Second Amendment to Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement amending the Channel Agreement, which is referred to as the ECP Amendment. The ECP Amendment modified the scope of the parties  collaboration under the Channel Agreement in
connection with the worldwide License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Ares Trading Agreement, which the Company and Intrexon entered into with Ares Trading S.A., or Ares Trading, on March 27, 2015. The ECP Amendment provided that Intrexon
will pay to the Company fifty percent of all payments that Intrexon receives for upfronts, milestones and royalties under the Ares Trading Agreement (see Note 5). The Amendment also reduces Intrexon s aggregate commitment under a Stock Purchase
Agreement that the parties executed in connection with the initial Channel Agreement to purchase the Company s common stock from $50.0 million to $43.5 million, which has been satisfied.  
 On June 29, 2015, the Company re-purchased 3,711 shares of common stock from Intrexon, at a discount of 5% to the closing price of the Company s
common stock on the date of purchase, which represented fractional shares that resulted from Intrexon s special stock dividend of the Company s shares to Intrexon s shareholders, for $34 thousand. On January 8, 2016, the Company
re-purchased an additional 168 shares of common stock from Intrexon for $2 thousand at the same terms as the previous share purchase.

   6. Related Party Transactions (continued)   
   
    On September 28, 2015, the Company entered into the GvHD Agreement with Intrexon, whereby the
Company will use Intrexon s technology directed towards  in vivo  expression of biologics to research, develop and commercialize products for use in the treatment or prevention of graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD (see Note 5). The
Company paid Intrexon a technology access fee of $10.0 million in cash in October 2015 and will reimburse Intrexon for all research and development costs. Subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the ECC Agreement, the
ECC Agreement also provides for equal sharing of the profits derived from the sale of the Products.       On June 29, 2016, the Company entered
into a Third Amendment to Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement, or the 2016 ECP Amendment, with Intrexon, amending the Channel Agreement, and an Amendment to Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, or the 2016 GvHD Amendment, amending their
existing Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, effective September 28, 2015, which the Company refers to as the GvHD Agreement. The 2016 ECP Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that the Company will pay to Intrexon under the Channel
Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of ZIOPHARM Products (as defined in the Channel Agreement), calculated on a ZIOPHARM Product-by-ZIOPHARM Product basis, subject to certain expense
allocations and other offsets provided in the Channel Agreement. The 2016 GvHD Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that the Company will pay to Intrexon under the GvHD Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in
that quarter from the sale of Products (as defined in the GvHD Agreement), subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the GvHD Agreement. The reductions in the royalty percentages provided by the 2016 ECP Amendment and the
2016 GvHD Amendment do not apply to sublicensing revenue or royalties under the Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement, nor do they apply to any royalties or other payments made with respect to sublicensing revenue from the Company s existing
collaboration with Merck Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA.    In consideration for the execution and delivery of the 2016 ECP Amendment
and the 2016 GvHD Amendment, the Company issued Intrexon 100,000 shares of its Series 1 preferred stock. Each share of the Company s Series 1 preferred stock has a stated value of $1,200, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization, and certain other rights, preferences, privileges and obligations (Note 8). The holders of the shares of Series 1 preferred stock are entitled to receive a monthly dividend, payable
in additional shares of Series 1 preferred stock, equal to $12.00 per preferred share held by such holder per month divided by the stated value of the preferred shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,063 shares of Series 1 preferred stock to Intrexon, the holder of
all of the outstanding shares of the Company s Series 1 preferred stock, as monthly dividend payments. The Company recorded $21 thousand for the fair value of the derivatives as a liability and $3.6 million for the fair value of the Series 1
preferred stock as a component of temporary equity. See Notes 3, 8 and 9 for additional discussion regarding the accounting for and valuation of these derivative financial instruments.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $17.0 million for services performed by Intrexon, of which $3.4 million is included
within current liabilities on the balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company expensed $11.7 million for services performed by Intrexon, of which $5.7 million is included within current liabilities on the balance
sheet.      Collaboration with Intrexon and MD Anderson    
 On January 13, 2015, the Company, together with Intrexon, entered into a license agreement with MD Anderson, which is referred to as the MD Anderson
License. Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, the Company and Intrexon hold an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel CAR +  T cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who is now the Company s Chief Executive Officer and was formerly a professor of pediatrics at MD Anderson and now
currently a visiting scientist under that institution s policies, as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under certain related technologies. In partial consideration for entering into the MD Anderson License, the Company
issued MD Anderson an aggregate of 11,722,163 shares of common stock for which the Company incurred a $67.3 million charge. The Company has determined that the rights acquired in the MD Anderson License represent in-process research and development
with no alternative future use. During the nine months ending September 30, 2016, the Company made three quarterly payments of $3.8 million bringing the total aggregate payments to $22.5 million under this arrangement.

   8. Preferred Stock   
 The Company has 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, of which, 250,000 shares are designated as Series 1 preferred stock.  
 On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into the 2016 ECP Amendment and 2016 GvHD Amendment with Intrexon (Note 5). In consideration for the execution and
delivery of the 2016 ECP Amendment and the 2016 GvHD Amendment, the Company issued to Intrexon 100,000 shares of its newly designated Series 1 preferred stock. Each share of the Company s Series 1 preferred stock has a stated value of $1,200,
subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization. The Series 1 preferred stock has the following rights and preferences and certain other rights, preferences, privileges and
obligations.     Conversion     All shares of Series 1
preferred stock shall automatically convert into shares of common stock upon the public announcement of the first approval in the United States of (i) a ZIOPHARM Product under the Channel Agreement, (ii) a Product under the GvHD Agreement
or (iii) a Product under the Ares Trading Agreement, which the Company refers to as the Conversion Event Date. On the second business day following the Conversion Event Date, each of Series 1 preferred stock shall convert into a number of
shares of common stock equal to the stated value of such Series 1 preferred stock, divided by the greater of (i) the volume weighted average closing price of common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC over the 20 trading days
ending on the Conversion Event Date or (ii) $1.00 per share; however, without shareholder approval in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Company will not affect any conversion of the Series 1 preferred stock into shares of common
stock in excess of 19.9% of the lesser of (i) the pre-transaction outstanding shares of common stock or (ii) the outstanding shares of common stock at the time of conversion. In addition, without shareholder approval in accordance with the
NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Company will not affect any conversion of the Series 1 preferred stock into common stock to the extent that the number of shares of common stock issued in such conversion would constitute a change of control under the
NASDAQ Listing Rules.     Dividends     A monthly dividend,
payable in additional shares of Series 1 preferred stock, equal to $12.00 per share, per month divided by the stated value per share, or the PIK Dividend; provided, that if any shares of Series 1 preferred stock are not converted on the Conversion
Event Date (discussed below), then the rate of the PIK Dividend on all remaining unconverted shares of Series 1 preferred stock shall automatically increase from $12.00 to $24.00 per share, per month.  
  Liquidation Preference     In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or a change of control or sale, lease transfer or exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Company s assets prior to the conversion of the Series 1 preferred stock
into shares of common stock, then the Series 1 preferred stock will participate in the proceeds of the transaction on a pro rata basis along with common stock, treating the Series 1 preferred stock as if it had been converted into a number of shares
of common stock equal to the aggregate stated value of the Series 1 preferred stock, divided by the volume weighted average closing price of common stock over the 20 trading days ending on the public announcement of such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or change of control or sale, lease transfer or exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Company s assets. Alternatively, the Company may redeem the Series 1 preferred stock at a
redemption price equal to the pro rata amount that the Series 1 preferred stock would have received if it had been converted using the same formula.

   Voting Rights   
 The Series 1 preferred stock does not have any voting rights except that the Company may not, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Series 1 preferred stock, voting as a separate class, (i) amend, alter or repeal any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Series 1
preferred stock in a manner that is more adverse than the effect on any other class or series of the Company s capital stock; (ii) (A) create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or obligate itself to issue shares of, any
additional class or series of the Company s capital stock unless the same ranks junior or pari passu to the Series 1 preferred stock with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the
payment of dividends and rights of redemption, or (B) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security that is junior or pari passu to the Series 1 preferred stock with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, the payment of dividends or rights of redemption, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other security senior to the Series 1 preferred in respect of any such right, preference or privilege;
or (iii) enter into any transaction (or series of related transactions) the effect of which would adversely affect the holders of the Series 1 preferred stock in a manner that is more adverse than the effect on any other class or series of
capital stock.     Analysis     The Company analyzed the
features of the Series 1 preferred stock and determined that the conversion option and the Company s right to redeem the shares at liquidation are embedded derivatives that required bifurcation from the Series 1 preferred stock in accordance
with FASB ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . The embedded derivatives were valued as described below at $0.7 million. Upon issuance of the shares on July 1, 2016 the Company recorded the fair value of the derivatives as a liability and
the fair value of the Series 1 preferred stock of $118.4 million as a component of temporary equity. Furthermore, because of the temporary equity classification, the carrying value of the Series 1 preferred stock will not be accreted to redemption
value unless or until its redemption becomes probable.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,063
shares of Series 1 preferred stock to Intrexon, the holder of all of the outstanding shares of its Series 1 preferred stock, as monthly dividend payments. The Company recorded Series 1 preferred stock at a fair value of $3.6 million, which is a
component of temporary equity and recorded a gain on the change of the derivative liabilities in the amount of $21 thousand (Note 9).   The fair value of
the Series 1 preferred stock was estimated using a probability-weighted approach and a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was estimated using the  with  and  without  method where the
preferred stock was first valued with all of its features ( with  scenario) and then without derivatives subject to the valuation analysis ( without  scenario). The fair value of the derivatives was then estimated as the
difference between the fair value of the preferred stock in the  with  scenario and the preferred stock in the  without  scenario. The model also takes into account, management estimates of clinical success/failure based
upon market studies and probability of potential conversion and liquidation events. If these estimates were different, the valuations would change and that change could be material. Inputs to the models included the following:

 ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company seeking to acquire, develop and commercialize, on its own or with partners, a diverse portfolio of
cancer therapies that address unmet medical needs. We are currently focused on developing products in immuno-oncology, to enhance the immune system s ability to fight cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Pursuant to two exclusive
channel partner agreements, or Channel Agreements with Intrexon Corporation, or Intrexon, we obtained certain exclusive rights to Intrexon s technologies for use in the fields of oncology and graft-versus-host disease.  
 The technologies represent an industrialized engineering approach for molecular and cell biology and gene control. They employ an inducible gene-delivery
system, or switch, that enables controlled in vivo expression of genes that produce therapeutic proteins to treat cancer. We and Intrexon refer to this  switch  as the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System   , or RTS   , platform. Our initial product candidate being developed using the immuno-oncology platform is Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, a
clinical stage product that we license from Intrexon under the Channel Agreement.    Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex uses our gene delivery system to produce
interleukin-12, or IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein. IL-12 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine capable of reversing immune escape mechanisms and improving the function of tumor fighting natural killer, or NK, and T cells.
Additionally, expression of functional IL-12 in human subjects by direct intratumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex is further demonstrated by the generation of downstream interferon gamma, or
IFN-   . We have completed two Phase 2 studies evaluating Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, the first for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and the second for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. We are
conducting a single-center Phase 1b/2 study, following standard chemotherapy, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and a multi-center Phase 1 study in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma,
or GBM, or Grade III malignant glioma, a form of brain cancer. Both studies are enrolling patients. Early clinical data from the GBM study was presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) meeting in November 2015, and on February 24, 2016,
we announced the successful completion of the initial dosing phase of the study and the dosing of the first patient in the next succeeding cohort of the study. On June 27, 2016, we announced the successful completion of enrollment in the first
and second cohorts and the opening of a third cohort, which has now completed. An update on clinical data from this trial will occur during the 2016 SNO meeting. In addition, we will be presenting nonclinical data in a pontine mouse model at SNO; we
believe these data will support initiation of a pediatric brain tumor clinical trial during the first half of 2017. We also presented information about our ongoing breast cancer study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2015. We
presented updated information on the GBM and breast cancer studies at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June and on the GBM study at the American Society of Hematology Workshop on Genome Editing in July. We also
presented additional breast cancer clinical study results at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2016 Congress in October.    In addition to
Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex as monotherapy, we have undertaken pre-clinical studies that suggest we may be able to combine this viral-based immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or iCPI, to improve the anti-tumor effect for GBM. These
pre-clinical data were presented at the 19th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, or ASGCT, in May, and we believe the data will lend support to the first-in-human application of combining Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex with an
iCPI for investigational treatment of GBM.

  Pursuant to our Channel Agreement for the cancer program, we and Intrexon obtained an exclusive, worldwide
license to certain additional immuno-oncology technologies owned and licensed by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, including technologies relating to novel chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, NK cells and TCRs. We
refer to this as the MD Anderson License. We plan to develop genetically modified T cells and other immune cells that will target and kill cancer cells using viral and non-viral approaches to gene transfer. Regarding our non-viral approach, we are
using the  Sleeping Beauty  (SB) transposon/transposase system under the MD Anderson license to express CAR in clinical trials to render T cells specific for CD19. The initial associated trials showed favorable progression free survival, or
PFS, and/or overall survival when patient- and donor-derived CAR +  T cells were infused after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All patients receiving autologous SB-modified T cells had
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and most patients receiving allogeneic CAR +  T cells had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition to survival of the recipients, these trials demonstrated that the infused T
cells persisted for length of times that compared favorably with T cells genetically modified with virus to express CAR. An update was provided in publication (J Clin Invest. 2016 Sep 1;126(9):3363-76.). Additional bioprocessing steps are underway
to decrease the time the T cells are in culture during the manufacturing process which supports our efforts to address the challenges of cost and manufacturing time associated with these therapies. Data demonstrating reduced time in culture was
presented at the 2016 annual meeting of American Society of Gene   Cell Therapy (ASGCT) and additional pre-clinical information will be provided at the 2016 annual meeting of American Society of Hematology (ASH). Only a minority of tumor
antigens are on the surface and thus can be targeted by CARs, while most tumor-derived antigens are within the cell and will likely need to be targeted by TCRs. Therefore, we are developing approaches to target solid tumors using T cells genetically
modified with the SB system to express TCRs for recognition of neoantigens. An update was provided in publication (Molecular Therapy (2016); 24(6), 1078 1089) and further pre-clinical information regarding the targeting of solid tumors will be
presented at the annual meeting of ASH in December 2016. Control systems are also being developed such as the RTS for receptor and/or cytokine expression as well as for the conditional ablation of genetically modified cells using a kill switch.  
 We plan to leverage the synergy between the platforms to accelerate an immuno-oncology pipeline and programs for the development of allogeneic CAR +  T and/or NK cells that can be used as off-the-shelf, or OTS, therapies. For example, NK cells do not have endogenous TCRs, so do not require genetic editing to eliminate TCRs, and may be used as an
OTS therapy. Further, cytokines such as IL- 12 are  fuel  for NK cells. We have been conducting a T-cell trial using second generation technology with a revised CAR structure throughout 2016. Going forward, this trial will employ a
shortened manufacturing process as we enroll additional patients. We expect to enter the clinic with an additional CAR +  T therapy specific for CD33 for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute
myeloid leukemia or AML during the first half of 2017. An update on the pre-clinical data for the CD33 program will be provided at the 2016 annual meeting of ASH. We successfully completed an application to the National Institute of Health s
Office of Biotechnical Activities in June 2016 and expect to file an IND with the FDA before the end of 2016. Enrollment to the CD33 CAR +  T trial will occur in 2017. Together with Intrexon, we
currently have research programs evaluating additional CAR targets and CARs co-expressed with cytokines, in particular membrane bound interleukin-15 (mbIL15). In addition to developing T cells, we expect to initiate an investigator led trial of OTS
primary NK cells for AML after completing regulatory review during 2017. We have additional interest in OTS products such as the development of an allogenic CAR +  T therapy. T-cell specificity can
be redirected not only through CARs, but also TCRs; we also have plans to initiate programs investigating T cells genetically modified to express neoantigen-specific TCRs. We plan to continue to combine Intrexon s technology suite with our
capabilities to translate science to the patient, and to identify and develop additional products to stimulate or inhibit key pathways, including those used by the body s immune system, to treat cancer.  
 On March 27, 2015, we entered into a global collaboration with Intrexon focused exclusively on CAR T cell, or CAR +  T, products with Ares Trading, or Ares, a biopharmaceutical division of Merck KGaA, which we refer to as the Ares Trading Agreement. Intrexon will share the economic provisions of this collaboration
equally with us, including an upfront payment of $115.0 million that was received in July 2015, milestones and royalties. Under this collaboration, Ares already selected two CAR +  T targets for
which we will perform certain research activities that will, in part, be funded by Ares. Pursuant to the terms of an amendment to our Channel Agreement with Intrexon, or ECP Amendment, that we entered into at the time of the Ares Trading Agreement,
we will be responsible for any additional research and development expenditures. Once these candidates reach investigational new drug stage, the programs will be transferred to Ares for clinical development and commercialization. We, together with
Intrexon, will also independently conduct research and development on other CAR +  T candidates, with Ares Trading having the opportunity during clinical development to opt-in to these candidates
for additional payments to us and Intrexon.

  On September 28, 2015, we entered into a new Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, or the GvHD
Agreement, with Intrexon to develop therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, or HSCT, which significantly impairs the quality of
life and survival of many recipients. Allogeneic HSCT is used for the treatment of various diseases including hematological malignancies, immunological deficiencies as well as non-malignant conditions. Human studies have shown that administration of
low-dose subcutaneous interleukin-2, or IL-2, a cytokine critical for modulation of the immune system, in patients with steroid-refractory GvHD acts via regulatory T cells, or Tregs, to ameliorate its manifestations.  
 We believe that the combined expertise and knowledge gained from our research programs with Intrexon in adoptive T-cell therapies and cytokine modulation for
the treatment of cancer positions us well to develop and implement therapeutic approaches addressing an area of high unmet medical need for patients with GvHD. Through the GvHD Agreement, we, together with Intrexon, plan to pursue engineered cell
therapy strategies, used either separately or in combination, for targeted prevention and/or treatment of GvHD. The first approach is expected to utilize the infusion of Tregs, such as those conditionally expressing IL-2, such as utilizing the RTS
platform. The second approach is expected to utilize the deployment of Intrexon s orally-delivered microbe-based ActoBiotics    therapeutics, based on  Lactococcus lactis , such as to
express IL-2 to modulate immune function.

    Enabling Technology    
 Our approach to immuno-oncology and GvHD entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for the purpose of designing and constructing
new biological systems or redesigning/modifying existing biological systems. Biological systems are governed by DNA, the building block of gene programs, which control cellular processes by coding for the production of proteins and other molecules
that have a functional purpose and by regulating the activities of these molecules. This regulation occurs via complex biochemical and cellular reactions working through intricate cell signaling pathways, and control over these molecules modifies
the output of biological systems. Our approach to immuno-oncology and GvHD has been enabled by the application of information technology and advanced statistical analysis, also known as bioinformatics, to genetic engineering, as well as by
improvements in DNA synthesis. This approach aims to engineer gene-based programs or codes to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome. Its application is intended to allow more precise control of drug concentration and dose,
thereby improving the therapeutic index associated with the resulting drug. A further embodiment of this technology is the ability to eliminate genetically modified immune cells after infusion.  
 On January 6, 2011, we entered into the Channel Agreement, to develop and commercialize novel DNA-based therapeutics in the field of cancer treatment by
combining Intrexon s technological platform with our capabilities to translate science to the patient. As a result, our bioengineered DNA platform employs an inducible gene-delivery system that enables regulated and controlled delivery of genes
that produce therapeutic proteins to treat cancer. The first example of this regulated controlled delivery is achieved by producing IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein, under the control of Intrexon s proprietary biological
 switch  to turn on and off the therapeutic protein expression at the tumor site. We and Intrexon refer to this  switch  as the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System    or RTS   , platform. Our initial product candidate being developed using the immuno-oncology platform is Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex.  
 On September 28, 2015, we entered into the GvHD Agreement with Intrexon to develop therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of GvHD, a major
complication of allogeneic HSCT, which significantly impairs the quality of life and survival of many recipients. Some of the technologies used to generate product candidates for immuno-oncology have potential application for GvHD. These include the
ability to genetically modify cells using viral and non-viral approaches and the application of RTS    to control gene expression, such as cytokines. Some of these methodologies as well as our
expertise in bioprocessing are being investigated to generate regulatory T cells, or Tregs. In addition, we are generating genetically modified  L lactis  to alter the inflammatory milieu of patients with GvHD, especially of the
gastrointestinal tract. These modifications are facilitated though collaboration with ActoBiotics   , a division of Intrexon.  
 More detailed descriptions of our clinical development plans for each of these programs are set forth below under the caption   Product
Candidates.        Immuno-oncology and GvHD    
 Immuno-oncology, which typically utilizes a patient s own immune system to treat cancer, is one of the most actively pursued areas of research by
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies today. Cancer cells contain mutated proteins and may overexpress other proteins usually found in the body at low levels. The immune system typically recognizes unusual or aberrant cell protein expression
and eliminates these cells in a highly efficient process known as immune surveillance. Central players in immune surveillance are types of white blood cell known as the T cells and NK cells. In healthy individuals, T cells and NK cells can identify
and kill infected or abnormal cells, including cancer cells. Cancer cells develop the ability to evade immune surveillance, which is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. In the recent past, there has been substantial scientific
progress in countering these evasion mechanisms using immunotherapies, or therapies that activate the immune system.    On January 13, 2015, we,
together with Intrexon, entered into a license agreement with MD Anderson, which we refer to as the MD Anderson License. Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, we and Intrexon hold an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and
licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel CAR +  T cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who was then a tenured professor at MD Anderson,
as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under certain related technologies.

  Combining the non-viral genetic engineering technologies we licensed from MD Anderson together with
Intrexon s industrialized approach to gene engineering and cell control, we believe we can reprogram T cells to express a particular CAR or TCR construct that will enable the T cell and/or NK cell to recognize and target cancer cells. CAR +  T cells target cell surface tumor antigens, such as CD19, that exist on cancer cells and that are independent of human leukocyte antigens, or HLAs, and which we refer to as  public 
antigens. TCR-expressing T cells target tumor antigens that are dependent on HLAs and which we refer to as  private  antigens and include neo-antigens. NK cells target tumors with loss or differences of HLAs, or tumors with no defined
antigens. Most CAR +  T cell and TCR products currently being developed by competitors are autologous, or derived from the patient s own mononuclear white blood cells, and gene engineered with
viral technology. As a result, the patient s blood must be harvested, shipped to a manufacturing facility where the isolated mononuclear white blood cells are modified using a virus to express the CAR or TCR, and then shipped back to the
hospital and infused into the patient. The process can take weeks and is labor intensive and costly. Currently, this complex technique can only be done in sophisticated laboratories. We believe we will be able to manufacture genetically modified
cells using viral and non-viral methods. The latter may result in a reduced cost of manufacturing. We intend to use our gene transfer methods to develop allogeneic treatments that can be used as an OTS treatment. An allogeneic OTS (also referred to
as universal donor) treatment would enable a patient to be treated with a CAR +  T and/or NK-cell products that are created in advance of need from one or more separate healthy donor(s), possibly
genetically modified for a tumor type, and then distributed to multiple points of care. Our non-viral methods, which we believe are customizable, fast, and less costly than other gene transfer approaches, together with our industrialized, scalable
engineering approach are expected to enable highly efficient and less costly manufacturing approaches to gene engineered cell-based therapy. In addition, our proprietary RTS    and/or kill
switches may give us the ability to control  in vivo  gene expression of CAR or TCR or cytokine on T cells and/or NK cells, which we believe could result in significantly lower toxicity compared to other products currently in development.  
   Cancer Overview      Cancer is a group of diseases
characterized by either the runaway growth of cells or the failure of cells to die normally. Often, cancer cells spread to distant parts of the body, where they can form new tumors. Cancer can arise in any organ of the body and, according to the
American Cancer Society, strikes slightly less than one of every two American men and a little more than one of every three American women at some point in their lives.  
 It is reported that there are more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Carcinomas, the most common type of cancer, originate in tissues that cover a
surface or line a cavity of the body. Lymphomas are cancers of the lymph system, which is a circulatory system that bathes and cleanses the body s cells. Leukemias involve blood-forming tissues and blood cells. As their name indicates, brain
tumors are cancers that begin in the brain, skin cancers, including melanomas, originate in the skin, while soft tissue sarcoma arises in soft tissue. Cancers are considered metastatic if they spread through the blood or lymphatic system to other
parts of the body to form secondary tumors.    Cancer is caused by a series of mutations (alterations) in genes that control cells  ability to grow and
divide. Some mutations are inherited; others arise from environmental factors such as smoking or exposure to chemicals, radiation, or viruses that damage cells  DNA. The mutations cause cells to divide relentlessly or lose their normal ability
to die.    According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that about 1,685,210 new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2016 and about
595,690 Americans are expected to die from cancer in 2016. The cost of treating cancer is significant. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that the direct medical cost of cancer in 2013 was $74.8 billion.  
   Cancer Treatments      Major treatments for cancer
include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Newer approaches such as anti-angiogenic and targeted therapies are rapidly evolving. While there are many experimental treatments under investigation, including DNA and other
immunological-based therapies, we believe the prevalence of cancer will remain a significant unmet medical need. Many therapies, including combination approaches, with different mechanisms of action may be needed to overcome tumor escape. In
addition to monotherapy treatment in GBM, our approach to cancer treatment includes applying multiple modality and multi-delivery approaches that encompasses viral and non-viral mechanisms, differentiating us from many other companies in the field
of adoptive cellular therapy today.

   Market Opportunities   
 Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor affecting approximately 74,000 people worldwide each year. Recurrent glioblastoma is an aggressive cancer
with one of the lowest 3-year survival rates, at 3%, among all cancers. For patients who have experienced multiple recurrences the prognosis is particularly poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of 6-7 months, while OS in patients that have
failed temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy, is approximately 3-5 months. Given the poor overall prognosis and lack of effective treatments, new therapeutic approaches for malignant gliomas are needed.  
 It is estimated that there are nearly 3 million women living in the United States with a history of invasive breast cancer, and an additional 226,870
women were diagnosed in 2012. Approximately 50% of women diagnosed with primary breast cancer will eventually relapse and develop metastatic or advanced disease. In addition, around 10% of patients present with metastatic disease at first diagnosis.
The 5-year relative survival rate for women diagnosed with localized breast cancer is 98.6%; survival declines to 83.8% for regional stage and to 23.3% for distant stage. In addition to stage, factors that influence survival include tumor grade,
hormone receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.    According the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, an estimated 1,237,824
people in the US are living with, or are in remission from, leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. New diagnoses for such hematologic malignancies in the US are expected to reach 171,500 people in 2016. These new diagnoses are expected to account for
approximately 10% of the new cancer cases in the US in 2016.      GvHD Overview    
 GvHD is a major complication of allogeneic HSCT, which significantly impairs the quality of life and survival of many recipients. Allogeneic HSCT is an
increasingly important treatment of various diseases including hematological malignancies, immunological deficiencies as well as non-malignant conditions, and is considered to be the most effective form of tumor immunotherapy available to date.
However, GvHD, when immune (graft) cells in a transplant patient recognize their engrafted host as foreign and attack the patient s (host) cells, remains a major source of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HSCT. During development of
GvHD, activation of various immune cells, especially donor T cells, leads to damage of target organs including skin, liver, hematopoietic system, and of particular importance, gut.  
 There were approximately 23,000 allogeneic HSCT procedures in the US and Europe in 2013. Approximately 40% to 60% of HSCT recipients develop GvHD, either
acute or chronic. Immunosuppressive agents and systemic steroids routinely used to treat GvHD have limited efficacy and toxicity; patients with steroid-resistant acute GvHD have a dismal prognosis, with mortality rates in excess of 90%, defining the
need for safer, more effective therapies. New ways of treating and preventing GvHD have the potential to increase the market opportunity through (1) broadening of patient eligibility to receive allogeneic HSCT and (2) increasing the number
of effective donor/recipient combinations.

    Product Candidates    
 The following chart identifies our immuno-oncology product candidates and their current stage of development, each of which are described in more detail below.

Immuno-oncology programs:    
  Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex     Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex has
been evaluated in two Phase 2 studies, the first for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and the second for the treatment of unresectable recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. We are continuing to evaluate Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, in brain
cancer and breast cancer. Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, our most advanced product candidate, uses our gene delivery system to produce IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein.  
 More specifically, IL-12 is a potent immunostimulatory cytokine which activates and recruits dendritic cells that facilitate the cross-priming of tumor
antigen-specific T cells. We have developed an adenoviral vector, Ad-RTS-IL-12, administered intra-tumorally under the control of the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System    (RTS   ) expression platform. Gene expression and subsequent IL-12 protein production is tightly controlled by the activator ligand veledimex.

   Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for malignant glioma   
 We initiated a multi-center Phase 1 study in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM or Grade III malignant glioma, a form of brain cancer, in June of 2015.
We reported biologic data from this study in our presentation titled  Intra-tumoral regulated expression of IL-12 as a gene therapy approach to treatment of glioma  at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) 20th Annual Scientific Meeting,
November 19-22, 2015 in San Antonio, TX, and on February 24, 2016, we announced the successful completion of the initial dosing cohort and that the first patient has been dosed in the next succeeding cohort of the GBM study.  
 Our ongoing Phase 1, multi-center dose-escalation study of the gene therapy candidate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + orally-administered veledimex in patients with recurrent
or progressive GBM was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2016. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex is a novel viral gene therapy candidate for the controlled expression of IL-12.  
 On June 27, 2016, we announced the successful completion of enrollment in the first and second dosing cohorts as well as the initiation of enrollment in
a third cohort of our ongoing multi-center Phase 1 study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + orally administered veledimex to treat recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM) or grade III malignant glioma.  
 The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intratumoral Ad-RTS-hIL-12 injection activated upon dosing with
oral veledimex. Secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the immune responses elicited, and assessment of biologic response. The first cohort of seven patients received 20 mg doses of veledimex, the second cohort of six
patients received 40 mg doses of veledimex, and the third cohort received 30 mg doses of veledimex to refine the effect of activating the immune response within the tumor. The resultant immunologic activity that follows IL-12 expression from the
brain tumor suggests that no further dose escalation will be necessary and the optimal dosing may be reached sooner than initially anticipated.    Data from
11 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas were presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting in June. All of these patients had failed at least two prior lines of therapy and underwent partial resection leaving residual tumors, in certain cases with
significant tumor burden. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 was administered through direct injection into the brain tumor at the time of surgery and veledimex was taken orally to activate the production of IL-12 from the tumor site and stimulate an immune response. No
enrollment restrictions were imposed for tumor size or location within the supratentorial space.

  As of May 18th, the date of data collection for the ASCO presentation, overall median follow up was 6.2
months, with 10 of 11 patients alive. IL-12 in the bloodstream was measured and was found to be proportional to the amount of veledimex administered, demonstrating that this orally-delivered activator crossed the blood brain barrier to turn on the
RheoSwitch    technology in a dose-dependent manner.    It is increasingly recognized that the
measurement of progression free survival, or PFS, with immunotherapy may not correlate directly with overall survival, or OS. For purposes of the data that we presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting, all pseudoprogression/progression were assumed to
trigger progressive disease for PFS analysis by Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology, or RANO. However, clinical benefit, including long term survival and tumor regression, can still occur after initial disease progression or after the appearance
of new lesions in the Immunotherapy Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology, or iRANO.    Overall, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex was well tolerated, with a
higher incidence of grade 3 or greater adverse events in the 40 mg cohort. All serious adverse events and Grade 3 related toxicities were rapidly reversible upon discontinuation of veledimex. The most common related adverse events included headache,
nausea/vomiting, fever, white blood cell/leukocyte count decrease, platelet count decrease, liver function test increase and cytokine release syndrome. Five subjects had related serious adverse events. As of July 8, 2016, we received a report
of one additional death occurring approximately 3.9 months after completing veledimex therapy and subsequently receiving additional salvage therapy. The death is unrelated to Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex.  
 On July 15, 2016 the Company issued a statement with regard to a third death that had been recently reported to us. In our statement we announced that we
were collecting and analyzing information concerning this death to determine appropriate and timely reporting to the FDA. The cause of death was an intracranial hemorrhage, which occurred some time after the patient had been discharged from the
treating center. We have determined that this is an isolated case, and there have been no other reported related instances of brain hemorrhage in any pervious cohort or prior studies with Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex. On July 19 th , we announced that the Safety Review Committee for the GBM trial concluded that this third patient death was unrelated to study drug. The GBM trial remained open to enrollment and we have
subsequently completed the 30 mg cohort. We expect to provide further updates on the progress of the study, including longer-term survival follow up, at the upcoming SNO 21st Annual Scientific Meeting November 17 - 20, 2016 in Scottsdale,
Arizona, in a poster entitled  Phase 1 study of intratumoral viral delivery of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + oral veledimex is well tolerated and suggests survival benefit in recurrent high grade glioma . In addition, a nonclinical poster entitled
 Local regulated IL-12 expression as an immunotherapy for the treatment of pontine glioma  will be presented. We intend to initiate a pediatric brain tumor study in the first half of 2017.  
 For patients who have experienced multiple recurrences of GBM, as the patients in our study have, prognoses are particularly poor. As of July 19 th , median follow up in the first dose cohort from our study was 8 months, and the overall survival remains very encouraging in a population with an expected overall survival of 3 to 5 months for
patients that have failed temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy.   We reported pre-clinical data on combining Ad-RTS-IL-12 +
veledimex with iCPI at ASGCT May 6, 2016 The combination of controlled expression of IL-12 with multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors in a GBM mice model showed superior results than either treatment alone, with a combination with anti-PD1
demonstrating 100% survival. These data provide a strong scientific rationale for evaluating this combination in human GBM; ZIOPHARM plans to initiate a combination study in the first half of 2017 in recurrent GBM.  
 On July 23, 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for the treatment of malignant glioma. Orphan drug designation
provides eligibility for a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the United States after product approval, an accelerated review process, accelerated approval where appropriate, grant funding, tax benefits and an exemption from user fees.

   Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for metastatic breast cancer   
 On April 27, 2015, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1b/2 study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex following standard chemotherapy for the treatment of
patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study is being conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and will evaluate improving the patient s response at 12-weeks. A poster presentation of this
study titled  Phase 1b/2 study of intra-tumoral Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex in patients with chemotherapy-responsive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, in San Antonio,
Texas in December 2015. We also presented updated information on the study at the 2016 ASCO meeting in June 2016.    We presented an update of the study at
the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2016 Congress, October 7 th  -11 th  in Copenhagen, Denmark. As of August 30, 2016, a
total of nine patients were available for initial assessment. Results show that Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + 7 days of veledimex consistently elicited production of IL-12 which in turn produced IFN   . It was notable
that the intratumoral influx of CD8+ T cells and IFN    were present six weeks after completion of veledimex consistent with the ability of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 to favorably impact the tumor environment over the
long term. In two patients, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex provided a meaningful drug holiday, with durable responses for 18 and 35 weeks. In all patients, disease control rate (DCR) was 44% at Week 6 and 22% at Week 12. Overall response rate (ORR),
defined as achieving a partial response (PR) or better, was 11% at Week 12. Most toxicities promptly reversed upon discontinuation of veledimex, including cytokine release syndrome (grade 1-2 CRS), observed in six of nine patients. The higher than
expected incidence of CRS was likely related to CYP-3A4 drug interactions with veledimex (80 mg) which resulted in enhanced peak cytokine expression.  
  CAR +  T, NK and TCR cells   
 We are actively pursuing viral and non-viral genetic engineering technologies and approaches to cell propagation to develop novel CAR +  T, NK and TCR therapies. Combining this technology with Intrexon s industrialized synthetic biologic engineering and clinically tested and validated RTS modules and/or kill switches, represents
a differentiated approach to genetically modified T cells and other immune cells, such as NK cells. Employing novel cell engineering techniques and multigenic gene programs, we expect to implement next-generation non-viral and viral adoptive
cellular therapies based on specialized cytokines, CARs and TCR s targeting both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.    The platform we,
together with Intrexon, exclusively licensed from MD Anderson uses the  Sleeping Beauty,  or SB, non-viral genetic modification system to generate and characterize new CAR +  T and TCR designs,
which enables a high throughput approach to evaluate the genetically modified immune cells in oncology. In addition, we can rapidly assemble CARs and TCRs to fashion immuno-receptors that differ in specificity and ability to activate T cells. These
CAR and TCR molecules are evaluated based on measurements of T cell function, phenotype, and genotype. We believe this non-viral gene transfer using the SB system is unique in the field of oncology and may avoid the expense and manufacturing
difficulty associated with creating T cells engineered to express CAR and TCR using viral vectors. After electroporation, the transposon/transposase employed by  Sleeping Beauty  improves the efficiency of integration of donor plasmids used to
express CAR and other transgenes in T cells. Propagation of genetically modified T cells on bio-engineered activating and propagating cells (AaPC) may provide a competitive advantage over other methods of modification. The SB system combined with
AaPC can selectively propagate and thus retrieve CAR-expressing T cells suitable for human applications. The time in culture with AaPC may be shortened to manufacture minimally-manipulated T cells within days of gene transfer by electroporation.
Associated pre-clinical data was presented at ASGCT on May 5, 2016 and further information will be presented at the 2016 annual meeting of ASH in December regarding exploring technologies that eliminate the need for  in vitro  propagation.
We are also exploring the use of lentivirus to genetically reprogram T cells with CAR to redirect T-cell specificity.    The ability to genetically modify
immune cells using non-viral and viral-based technologies enables us to express other genes in addition to immunoreceptors (CARs and TCRs) to redirect specificity. For example, we have developed a tethered or membrane-bound form of IL-15 (mbIL 15)
which in pre-clinical modeling endows CAR-expressing T cells with an ability to be long-lived. The Company expects to build upon these data to co-express immunoreceptors with cytokines and to leverage its ability to control expression with RTS
and/or kill switches. Using this unique set of genetic engineering tools, the company can employ a broad immunotherapy approach against cancer.

   CAR +  T   
 Through the MD Anderson License, the Company was able to enter the clinic with three CAR +  T therapies in
2015 utilizing the non-viral genetic modification capabilities of the SB system. Two of these trials are with  first generation  technologies, the results from which were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation August 2016. We
are currently enrolling an investigator lead Phase 1 study infusing our 2nd generation CD19-specific CAR +  T cells in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies at MD Anderson. The manufacturing
process is being shortened with enrollment of future patients.    On July 12, 2016, we announced that after receiving feedback from the U.S. National
Institutes of Health Office of Biotechnology Activities  Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, we anticipated progressing plans for a Phase I adoptive cellular therapy clinical trial at MD Anderson infusing autologous T cells transduced with
lentivirus to express a CD33-specific CAR co-expressed with a kill switch in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Preclinical studies, to be updated at the 2016 annual meeting of ASH, demonstrated that lentiviral transduced CAR-T cells
targeting CD33 exhibit specific cytotoxic activity for CD33 +  AML cells. A proof-of-concept study utilizing an  in vivo  mouse model for AML showed that these CAR-T cells were able to
eliminate disease burden and significantly enhance survival as compared to control groups. These positive preliminary results indicate biological activity and are suggestive of potential therapeutic effect for the treatment of AML. We plan to
initiate this Phase 1 clinical trial at MD Anderson during the first half of 2017.    Development of
CAR +  T therapies for other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies is also underway with pre-clinical studies conducted throughout 2016. The Company expects to conduct a research program for the
development of an allogenic CAR +  T therapy and plans to initiate programs investigating T cells genetically modified to express TCR with preclinical studies planned for 2016. The primary factor
limiting the current deployment of a universal donor product is the potential for GvHD. GvHD occurs if infused allogeneic T cells regard the recipient s body as foreign. Previous research from Dr. Cooper and colleagues at MD Anderson
suggested that  universal  or OTS allogeneic T cells generated from one donor could be administered to multiple recipients. This is achieved by genetically editing CAR-expressing T cells to eliminate expression of the endogenous      TCR, the receptor most responsible for triggering GvHD, without compromising CAR-dependent effector functions. Dr. Cooper and colleagues at MD Anderson also published research which demonstrated
that T cells can be permanently modified to eliminate TCR expression, demonstrating how to  a priori  generate cells from one allogeneic donor for infusion into multiple recipients. These studies represent steps towards our goal of on-demand
therapy that can be pre-deployed at multiple sites and infused when needed. The translation of the SB system and AaPC for use in clinical trials has the potential to show how a nimble and cost-effective approach to developing genetically modified T
cells can be used to implement clinical trials infusing next-generation T cells with improved therapeutic potential.     NK Cell   
 In addition to T cells, we are pursuing NK-cell therapies for the treatment of cancers. NK cells may have advantages over T-cell therapies in that killing is
independent of a target antigen and the lack of expression of endogenous TCR obviates the need to genetically edit the associated genes. Initially, this OTS NK cell treatment will be tested in patients with AML in a clinical trial at MD Anderson
which we expect to initiate in 2017.    Discovery programs are also underway to explore genetic modification of NK cells for increased tumor killing
specificity. We expect to advance these and other exploratory NK-cell programs in preclinical studies in 2016.  
      39  

Table of Contents  

   TCR     Many of
these genetic engineering technologies can also be applied towards targeting intracellular antigens with one or more TCRs. This approach is particularly important for addressing the complexity of solid tumors. We believe that SB is ideally suited
for targeting intracellular antigens by TCR as it may be more cost effective, should allow for rapid manufacturing and is customizable for individual patient therapies with the ability to include multiple TCRs in a single therapy. We are pursuing
discovery programs in TCR therapies for neoantigen targets. The development of an approach to create a truly personalized therapy for each cancer patient based on his/her neoantigens is a strategic goal of our Company.  
  GvHD Program     GVHD may occur after a bone marrow or stem
cell transplant in which someone receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. The new, transplanted cells regard the recipient s body as foreign. When this happens, the newly transplanted cells attack the recipient s body. We,
together with Intrexon, are initiating a research program focused on addressing the underlying pathologies of GvHD through its engineered cell platforms. The exclusive collaboration, or the GvHD Program, will focus on the pursuit of the following
engineered cell therapy strategies, used either separately or in combination, for the targeted treatment of GvHD: (i) the infusion of regulatory T cell expressing membrane-bound and/or soluble interleukin-2 and (ii) the deployment of
orally delivered, genetically modified  L. lactis  such as that express interleukin-2 to modulate immune function. We believe these strategies have the potential to broaden the number of patients eligible to receive allogeneic HCST and also
increase the number of effective donor/recipient combinations.     Milestones   
 We achieved and expect to achieve the following milestones in 2016 and 2017:

    Small molecule program    
 In addition to our immuno-oncology programs, we maintain certain rights to a small molecule program, darinaparsin which we are no longer directly developing.
We have entered into an amended and restated global licensing agreement with Solasia Pharma K.K., or Solasia, on July 31, 2014 granting Solasia an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize darinaparsin, and related organoarsenic
molecules, in both intravenous and oral forms in all indications for human use. In exchange, we will be eligible to receive from Solasia development-and sales-based milestones, a royalty on net sales of darinaparsin, once commercialized, and a
percentage of any sublicense revenues generated by Solasia. On March 28, 2016, Solasia initiated a multi-center pivotal clinical trial intended to provide substantial evidence of efficacy necessary to support the filing of an application for a
new drug approval in certain of the territories assigned to Solasia. The start of this trial triggered a $1.0 million milestone payment to us which was subsequently paid to MD Anderson under the terms of our license agreement with MD Anderson.

    Financial Overview    
  Overview of Results of Operations      Three and Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015       Revenue.   Revenue during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:      
   Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased in comparison to revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recognized $1.6 million in revenue under the Ares Trading Agreement (Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies). During the three months ended September 30,
2015, we recognized $271 thousand in revenue as part of normal amortization of a $5.0 million upfront payment received in March 2011 under the Solasia agreement (Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies). The $5.0 million upfront payment received in
March 2011 was amortized over the period of our research and development effort, which was completed in March 2016.    Revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased in comparison to revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from revenue recognized under the Ares Trading Agreement in the
amount of $4.8 million and Predictive in the amount of $200 thousand, offset by a decrease of $271 thousand from Solasia as the research and development effort under the Solasia agreement was completed in March 2016.  
 Deferred revenue of $49.5 million is comprised entirely of revenue to be recognized under the Ares Trading Agreement which will be earned over the period of
effort, estimated to be 9 years.      Research and development expenses.   Research and development expenses during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
   Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8.0 million, as compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to a one-time charge of $10.0 million for in process research and development with
Intrexon for GvHD programs incurred in September 2015. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million increase in employee related and stock compensation expense due to increased research and development headcount, a $0.8 million increase in spending
related to ongoing IL-12 and CAR +  T programs, and an approximately $0.2 million increase in spending on travel, contracted outside services and other operating costs.

  Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $49.8 million
when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in research and development is due the commitment to issue Series 1 preferred stock at fair value under the 2016 ECP Amendment and 2016 GvHD Amendment with Intrexon (see note
5) resulting in a $119.0 million non-cash charge. In the prior year we incurred a one-time charge of $67.3 million for the fair value of the common shares issued to MD Anderson in consideration for the MD Anderson License as well as a one-time
charge of $10.0 million for in process research and development with Intrexon for GvHD programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, preclinical expenses and drug shipping costs for
CAR +  T programs increased by $5.2 million, employee related and stock compensation expenses increased by $2.4 million due to increased research and development headcount, costs for ongoing
clinical trials increased by $1.0 million, and contracted outside services and other operating costs increased by $0.1 million. These costs were offset by $0.6 million in decreased spending in small molecule programs in the current year as the
company is no longer pursuing those technologies.    Our research and development expense consists primarily of licensing costs, collaboration costs,
salaries and related expenses for personnel, costs of contract manufacturing services, costs of facilities and equipment, fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials, fees paid to research organizations in
conjunction with preclinical animal studies, costs of materials used in research and development, consulting, license and milestone payments and sponsored research fees paid to third parties.  
 We have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel-related costs on a
program-by-program basis. Our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects, and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors. As a result, we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our
oncology programs on a program-by-program basis.    Our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future programs will be
subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. We test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy. We may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product. As we obtain results from
trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products or indications. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time
generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product. It is not unusual for preclinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to require the expenditure of substantial
resources.    We estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following
timelines:      
   The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences
arising during clinical development, including, among others, the following:      

The number of clinical sites included in the trials;        

The length of time required to enroll suitable patents;        

The number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;        

The duration of patient follow-up to ensure the absence of long-term product-related adverse events; and        

The efficacy and safety profile of the product.      As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are
unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our programs in a timely manner or our failure
to enter into appropriate collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time-to-time
in order to continue with our product development strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.

    General and administrative expenses.   General and administrative expenses during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
   General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.5 million, as compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $0.4 million increase in stock compensation and employee related expenses incurred in the year. Additionally,
contracted outside service expenses and other operating expense costs increased by $0.1 million in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $3.3 million, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in stock compensation and employee related expenses, a $1.2 million decrease in outside contracted service costs,
and a $0.4 million decrease in travel and other operating expenses.      Other income (expense).   Other income (expense) for three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
   The increase in other income (expense) from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily to interest received on our cash balance. The change in derivative liabilities was not applicable in 2015.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $94.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $140.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of
December 31, 2015. Given our current development plans, we anticipate that our current cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. However, changes may occur that would consume our existing capital
prior to that time, including the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and changes in governmental regulation. Actual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. We have estimated the sufficiency of our cash resources based in part on the anticipated advancement of our immuno-oncology product
candidates in the clinic under our exclusive partnership and collaboration with Intrexon and the MD Anderson License, and we expect that the costs associated with these product candidates, as well as additional product candidates in our pipeline,
will increase the level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward.    Although all human clinical trials are expensive
and difficult to design and implement, we believe that due to complexity, costs associated with clinical trials for immuno-oncology products are greater than the corresponding costs associated with clinical trials for small molecule candidates.  
 In addition to these factors, our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include,
but are not limited to, changes in the focus and direction of our development programs, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the development of our product candidates, our ability to secure partnering arrangements, and costs of
filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated, regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or
at all, we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them.  
 We expect that we will need additional financing to support our long-term plans for clinical trials and new product development. We expect to finance our cash
needs through the sale of equity securities, strategic collaborations and/or debt financings, or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funding from any of these
sources or, if obtained, what the terms of such funding(s) may be, or that any amount that we are able to obtain will be adequate to support our working capital requirements until we achieve profitable operations. We have no current committed
sources of additional capital. Recently, capital markets have experienced a period of instability that may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. If we are unable to
raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue development and regulatory approval of our products, or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our research and development programs.

  The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than
investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net loss for:      

Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and common and preferred stock issued in exchange for license agreements;    

Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and

Changes associated with the fair value of our derivative liabilities.      The $69.1 million increase in cash used
is primarily driven by higher net loss of $44.0 million, an increase of $52.0 million in charges related to stock issued in exchange for license agreements, a decrease in deferred revenue of $60.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
expenses of $15.0 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.0 million.    Net cash used in investing activities was $467 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $25 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to leasehold improvement charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Net cash used in financing activities was $304 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $97.3 million provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $97.6 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to proceeds of approximately $94.3 million associated with our February 2015 public offering
and $3.1 million from stock option exercises in the prior year, compared to $549 thousand in stock option exercises in the current year.

   Operating capital and capital expenditure requirements   
 We anticipate that losses will continue for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit was approximately $646.8 million. Our
actual cash requirements may vary materially from those planned because of a number of factors including:      

Changes in the focus, direction and pace of our development programs;        

Competitive and technical advances;        

Costs associated with the development of our product candidates;        

Our ability to secure partnering arrangements;        

Costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights, or other developments, and    

Other matters identified under Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors.       Working capital as of
September 30, 2016 was $100.0 million, consisting of $115.7 million in current assets and $15.7 million in current liabilities. Working capital as of December 31, 2015 was $134.4 million, consisting of $152.5 million in current assets and
$18.1 million in current liabilities.     Contractual obligations   
 The following table summarizes our outstanding obligations as of September 30, 2016 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity
and cash flows in future periods:      
   Our commitments for operating leases relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in Boston, MA, and office space in New
York, NY. On December 21, 2015 and April 15, 2016, we renewed the sublease for our corporate headquarters in Boston, MA through August 31, 2021. Our commitments for royalty and license fees relate to our agreement with Baxter
Healthcare Corporation for the purchase of the assets relating to indibulin. The remaining contract installment payments to Baxter are comprised of two separate $250 thousand payments on November 3rd of 2016 and 2017. Included in the above
table are obligations for the subleased portion of our New York office (see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies). We expect to receive a total of $306 thousand in the next year and $362 thousand in the next 2-3 years from our subtenants in the New
York office.    On January 13, 2015, we entered into the MD Anderson License as detailed in Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies. The agreement
includes minimum quarterly payments of $3.8 million included in the above table within  Royalty and License Fees . Our obligations related to this agreement are payments of $15.0 million in the column  Less than 1 Year  and $7.8
million in the column  2   3 Years.

   Off-balance sheet arrangements   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     In our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our financial status depends were identified as those relating to clinical trial expenses; collaboration agreements;
fair value measurements for stock-based compensation; and income taxes. We reviewed our policies and determined that those policies remain our most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 Our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and
fiduciary control of cash. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our goals, we maintain our cash in interest-bearing bank accounts in global banks, United States treasuries and other
government-backed investments, which are subject to minimal interest rate risk.      Effect of Currency Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Risk Management
     We conduct clinical studies outside of the United States primarily in Western Europe. These business operations are not material at this time,
therefore any currency fluctuations will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.      
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures     Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, on a timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    No change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

     Part II - Other Information   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 In the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities.
The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible and could materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome,
litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management attention and resources and other factors.    As of
September 30, 2016, there are no matters that, in the opinion of management, might have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors     The
following important factors could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere by management from time to time.
The risk factors in this Quarterly Report have been revised to incorporate changes to our risk factors from those included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The risk factors set forth below with an
asterisk (*) next to the title are new risk factors or risk factors containing changes, which may be material, from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS   
   * Our plans to develop and commercialize non-viral and viral adoptive cellular therapies based on engineered cytokines and novel chimeric antigen
receptor, or CAR, T cell and natural killer, or NK, cell therapies as well as T cell Receptor, or TCR, therapies can be considered as new approaches to cancer treatment, the successful development of which is subject to significant challenges.
     We intend to employ technologies such as the technology licensed from MD Anderson pursuant to the MD Anderson License described above, and from
Intrexon, pursuant to the Channel Agreement, to pursue the development and commercialization of non-viral and viral adoptive cellular therapies based on cytokines, T cells, NK cells, CARs and TCR s possibly under control of the RTS    and other switch technologies targeting both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Because this is a new approach to cancer immunotherapy and cancer treatment generally, developing and
commercializing product candidates subjects us to a number of challenges, including:      

obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that have very limited experience with the commercial development of genetically modified and/or unmodified T-cell and NK-cell therapies for
cancer;        

developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient s and/or donor s T cells or NK cells  ex vivo  and infusing the T cells or NK cells back into the patient;

possibly conditioning patients with chemotherapy in conjunction with delivering each of the potential products, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects of the potential products;    

educating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of each of the potential products, such as the potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release;    

addressing any competing technological and market developments;        

developing processes for the safe administration of these potential products, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive the potential products;    

sourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process the potential products;    

developing a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;    

establishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance;        

developing therapies for types of cancers beyond those addressed by the current potential products;        

maintaining and defending the intellectual property rights relating to any products we develop; and        

not infringing the intellectual property rights, in particular, the patent rights, of third parties, including competitors such as developing T-cell and/or NK-cell therapies.    
      49  

Table of Contents  

  We cannot be sure that immunotherapy technologies that we intend to develop in partnership with MD Anderson and
Intrexon will yield satisfactory products that are safe and effective, scalable, or profitable. Moreover, public perception of therapy safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel approaches to treatment, may adversely influence
the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians to subscribe to the novel treatment mechanics. Physicians, hospitals and third-party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment
practices that require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt this novel and personalized therapy, may decide the therapy is too complex to adopt without appropriate training and may choose
not to administer the therapy. Based on these and other factors, hospitals and payors may decide that the benefits of this new therapy do not or will not outweigh its costs.  
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these challenges, which could prevent us from achieving our research, development and
commercialization goals.      * Our current product candidates are based on novel technologies and are supported by limited clinical data and we cannot
assure you that our current and planned clinical trials will produce data that supports regulatory approval of one or more of these product candidates.    
 Our Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement with Intrexon contemplate our use of Intrexon s advanced transgene engineering platform for the controlled and
precise cellular production of anti-cancer effectors and for the development of therapeutic approaches for GvHD. The immuno-oncology effector platform in which we have acquired rights represents early-stage technology in the field of human oncology
biotherapeutic, with DC-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex having completed a Phase 1 study in melanoma and Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex having completed two Phase 2 studies, in melanoma and breast cancer. We are continuing to pursue intratumoral injection of
Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex in brain cancer and breast cancer. Although we plan to leverage Intrexon s immuno-oncology platform for additional products targeting key pathways used by cancers to grow and metastasize, we may not be successful in
developing and commercializing these products for a variety of reasons.    Similarly, our genetically modified and/or non-modified T cell and/or NK cell
product candidates are supported by limited clinical data, all of which has been generated through trials conducted by MD Anderson, not by us. We plan to assume control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of our T cell and NK cell
product candidates, and any failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, sponsorship of INDs or in filing new INDs sponsored by us for these or any other product candidates we determine to advance could negatively affect the timing of our potential
future clinical trials. Such an impact on timing could increase research and development costs and could delay or prevent obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Further, we did not control the design or conduct of the previous trials. It is possible that the FDA will not accept these previous trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any
of one or more reasons, including the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate, the degree of product characterization, elements of the design or execution of the previous trials or safety concerns, or other trial results. We may also be
subject to liabilities arising from any treatment-related injuries or adverse effects in patients enrolled in these previous trials. As a result, we may be subject to unforeseen third-party claims and delays in our potential future clinical trials.
We may also be required to repeat in whole or in part clinical trials previously conducted by MD Anderson or other entities, which will be expensive and delay the submission and licensure or other regulatory approvals with respect to any of our
product candidates.    In addition, the results of the limited clinical trials conducted by us, Intrexon and MD Anderson to date may not be replicated in
future clinical trials. Our Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex and genetically modified and non-modified T cell and NK cell product candidates, as well as other product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development and we
cannot assure you that the results of any future trials will demonstrate the value and efficacy of our product candidates. Moreover, there are a number of regulatory requirements that we must satisfy before we can continue clinical trials of CAR +  T or other cellular therapy product candidates in the United States. Satisfaction of these requirements will entail substantial time, effort and financial resources. Any time, effort and financial
resources we expend on our Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex and genetically modified and non-modified T cell and NK cell product candidates and other early-stage product candidate development programs may adversely affect our ability to continue development
and commercialization of our immuno-oncology product candidates.

    * If we cannot compete successfully for market share against other biopharmaceutical companies, we may not
achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.      The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing
genetically engineered T cells and NK cells in particular, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Genetically engineering T cells and NK cells faces significant competition in the CAR and TCR technology space from multiple
companies and their collaborators, such as Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird bio/Celgene/Baylor College of Medicine, Kite Pharma/National Cancer Institute, Juno Therapeutics/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center/Seattle Children s Research Institute, Cellectis/Pfizer, Adaptimmune/GSK, Celgene, NantKwest, Gritstone, Neon, BioNTech, and Advaxis. We also face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by other companies such as
Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, and Roche. In addition, our gene therapy immuno-oncology products such as Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex face competition from VBL Therapeutics, Immunocellular Therapeutics, Merck, Genentech,
Bristol-Myers, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Tocagen, OncoSec and Insys Therapeutics. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of potential products, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our potential products.
Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. Additionally, the availability and
price of our competitors  products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our potential products. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our potential products is inhibited by price
competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our potential products, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our potential products. Additionally, a
competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as one of our potential products, that may prevent us from obtaining
approval from the FDA for such potential products for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business
will suffer.    We compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical
companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have products already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together
with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:  

developing drugs and biopharmaceuticals;        

undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;        

obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs and biopharmaceuticals;        

formulating and manufacturing drugs and biopharmaceuticals; and        

launching, marketing, and selling drugs and biopharmaceuticals.      Our commercial opportunity could be reduced
or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA
or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to
compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.      *Any termination of
our licenses with Intrexon or MD Anderson could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.    
 We are dependent on patents, know-how, and proprietary technology that are licensed from others, particularly MD Anderson and Intrexon. Any termination of
these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Disputes may also arise between us and these licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement,
including those relating to:      

the scope of rights granted under the applicable license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;        

whether and the extent to which our technology and processes, and the technology and processes of Intrexon, MD Anderson and our other licensors, infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to
the applicable license agreement;        

our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties pursuant to our relationships with our licensors and partners;        

whether we and/or Intrexon are complying with our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our potential products under the MD
Anderson License; and        

the allocation of ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and by us.    
      51  

Table of Contents  

  If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our
current licensing arrangements, particularly with MD Anderson, on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected potential products. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to
protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize potential products under our applicable
licenses could suffer.    There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, and reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, or oppositions and other
comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Recently, due to changes in U.S. law referred to as patent reform, new procedures including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented, which adds uncertainty to the possibility
of challenge to our or our licensors  patents in the future.      * We will require additional financial resources in order to continue ongoing
development of our product candidates; if we are unable to obtain these additional resources, we may be forced to delay or discontinue clinical testing of our product candidates.    
 We have not generated significant revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $154.1 million, and, as of September 30, 2016, we have incurred approximately $646.8 million of cumulative net losses since our inception in 2003. We expect to continue to incur significant
operating expenditures and net losses. Further development of our product candidates, including product candidates that we may develop under our Channel Agreement or GvHD Agreement with Intrexon, pursuant to the MD Anderson License or pursuant to
the Ares Trading Agreement, will likely require substantial increases in our expenses as we:      

continue to undertake clinical trials for product candidates;        

scale-up the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates;        

seek regulatory approvals for product candidates;        

work with regulatory authorities to identify and address program related inquiries;        

implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;        

hire additional personnel;        

begin to advance candidates pursuant to the MD Anderson License; and        

commence providing funding for certain research and development activities of MD Anderson pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License.    
 We continue to seek additional financial resources to fund the further development of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional
capital, one or more of these programs could be placed on hold. Because we are currently devoting a significant portion of our resources to the development of immuno-oncology, further progress with the development of our other candidates may be
significantly delayed and may depend on the licensing of those compounds to third parties.    As of September 30, 2016, we have approximately $94.7
million of cash and cash equivalents. Given our current development plans, we anticipate our current cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2017 and we have no current committed sources of additional
capital. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us when needed, if at all. Our business is highly cash-intensive and our ability to continue operations after our current cash resources are
exhausted depends on our ability to obtain additional financing and/or achieve profitable operations, as to which no assurances can be given. If adequate additional funds are not available when required, or if we are unsuccessful in entering into
partnership agreements for the further development of our products, we will be required to delay, reduce or eliminate planned preclinical and clinical trials and may be forced to terminate the approval process for our product candidates from the FDA
or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego attractive business opportunities or pursue merger or divestiture strategies. In the event we are unable to obtain additional financing, we
may be forced to cease operations altogether.

    * We need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. The manner in which we raise any additional
funds may affect the value of your investment in our common stock.      As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred approximately $646.8 million
of cumulative net losses and had approximately $94.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Given our current development plans, we anticipate that our current cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2017.
However, changes may occur that would consume our existing capital prior to then, including expansion of the scope of, and/or slower than expected progress of, our research and development efforts and changes in governmental regulation. Actual costs
may ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. Also our estimates include
the advancement of our immuno-oncology product candidates in the clinic under our Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement with Intrexon and our increased expenses as we begin to advance candidates pursuant to the MD Anderson License with MD Anderson
and commence providing funding for certain research and development activities of MD Anderson pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License, and we expect that the costs associated with these and additional product candidates will increase the
level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward.    In addition to above factors, our actual cash requirements may vary
materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, changes in the focus and direction of our development programs, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the
development of our product candidates, our ability to secure partnering arrangements, and costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated,
regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to
prioritize among them.    The unpredictability of the capital markets may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on
terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Moreover, if we fail to advance one or more of our current product candidates to later-stage clinical trials, successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates, or acquire new product
candidates for development, we may have difficulty attracting investors that might otherwise be a source of additional financing.    Our need for additional
capital and limited capital resources may force us to accept financing terms that could be significantly dilutive to existing stockholders. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience
dilution. In addition, we may grant future investors rights superior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our
technologies, product candidates or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we could incur significant interest expense and become subject to covenants in the related
transaction documentation that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business.      Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and
difficult to design, initiate and implement.      Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design, initiate and implement, in part
because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial start-up and process itself is also time-consuming and results are inherently uncertain. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least
several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to delay the start of, abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be
delayed by several factors, including:      

Additional nonclinical data requests by regulatory agencies;        

Unforeseen safety issues;        

Determination of dosing issues;        

Lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;        

Slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;        

Inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;        

Inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and        

Regulatory determinations to temporarily or permanently cease enrollment for other reasons not related to patient safety.    
      53

  Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be
successful. In addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our IND submission or in the conduct of these trials.
     See also  Risks Related to the Clinical Testing, Regulatory Approval and Manufacturing of our Product Candidates   Our product
candidates are in various stages of clinical trials, which are very expensive and time-consuming. We cannot be certain when we will be able to submit an NDA or BLA, to the FDA and any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product
candidates could harm our business.        * We may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates.
     We have received orphan drug designation for Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for the treatment of malignant glioma in the United States, and we may be
able to receive additional orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for our other product candidates. In the United States, orphan designation is available to drugs intended to treat, diagnose or prevent a rare
disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States at the time of application for orphan designation. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for a tax credit and marketing incentives. The first sponsor
to receive FDA marketing approval for a drug with an orphan designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication and, typically, a waiver of the prescription drug user fee for
its marketing application. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, the approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year
exclusive marketing period. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug.
There is no guarantee that any of our other product candidates will receive orphan drug designation or that, even if such product candidate is granted such status, the product candidate s clinical development and regulatory approval process
will not be delayed or will be successful.      * We may not be able to commercialize any products, generate significant revenues, or attain
profitability.      To date, none of our product candidates have been approved for commercial sale in any country. The process to develop, obtain
regulatory approval for, and commercialize potential product candidates is long, complex, and costly. Unless and until we receive approval from the FDA and/or other foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our drugs
and will not have product revenues. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, if we are unable to successfully commercialize our products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or
maintain profitability, or to continue our business without raising significant additional capital, which may not be available. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.  
   * Ethical, legal and social concerns about biologically engineered products could limit or prevent the use of our product candidates.    
 Our product candidates use an immuno-oncology platform. Public perception about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over,
genetically engineered products could influence public acceptance of our product candidates. If we and our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical, legal and social concerns relating to biological engineering, our product candidates may
not be accepted. These concerns could result in increased expenses, regulatory scrutiny, delays or other impediments to the public acceptance and commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to develop and commercialize products could be
limited by public attitudes and governmental regulation.    The subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity, which has aroused
public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on the development and commercialization of genetically altered products. Further, there is a risk that our product candidates could cause adverse health
effects or other adverse events, which could also lead to negative publicity.    The biological platform that we use may have significantly enhanced
characteristics compared to those found in naturally occurring organisms, enzymes or microbes. While we believe we produce biological technologies only for use in a controlled laboratory and industrial environment, the release of such biological
technologies into uncontrolled environments could have unintended consequences. Any adverse effect resulting from such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, and we may have exposure to liability for
any resulting harm.  
      54

    * Our use of immuno-oncology to develop product candidates may become subject to increasing regulation in
the future.      Most of the laws and regulations concerning immuno-oncology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, but that may
change. For example, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended in December 2010 that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the
government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. Other findings and recommendations have been published by
the Presidential Commission through 2014. Immuno-oncology may become subject to additional government regulations as a result of the recommendations, which could require us to incur significant additional capital and operating expenditures and other
costs in complying with these laws and regulations.      * We will incur additional expenses in connection with our Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement
with Intrexon Corporation.      The immuno-oncology platform, in which we have acquired rights for cancer indications and for the development of
therapeutic approaches for GvHD from Intrexon, includes two existing product candidates, Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex and DC-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex. Upon entry into the Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement with Intrexon, we assumed responsibility for the
clinical development of these product candidates, and our cell therapy programs, which we expect will increase the level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward. Although all human clinical trials are expensive
and difficult to design and implement, we believe that due to complexity, costs associated with clinical trials for immuno-oncology products are greater than the corresponding costs associated with clinical trials for small molecule candidates. In
addition to increased research and development costs, we may need to add headcount to support our Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement endeavors, which would add to our general and administrative expenses going forward.  
 Although our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources takes into account our plans to develop the Intrexon products, the actual
costs associated therewith may be significantly in excess of forecasted amounts. In addition to the amount and timing of expenses related to the clinical trials, our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a
number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, changes in the focus and direction of our development programs, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the development of our product candidates and costs of
filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated, regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or
at all, we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them.

    *Failing to pay any dividends on our Series 1 preferred stock issued to Intrexon may have adverse
consequences.      In June 2016, we amended our Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement with Intrexon in order to, among other things, reduce the royalty
rate on operating profits payable by us to Intrexon from 50% to 20%. In consideration for these amendments, we issued to Intrexon shares of our Series 1 preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, or Series 1 preferred stock, which include, among
other things, a monthly dividend of 1% payable in additional shares of Series 1 preferred stock. If we fail to pay such dividends when due, it would affect our eligibility to file Registration Statements on Form S-3 and our status as a
 well-known seasoned issuer , which may increase the expense and time associated with both the filing and effectiveness of future registration statements and the consummation of future financing transactions or other offerings of our
securities.      *Our common stockholders may experience additional dilution as a result of the Series 1 preferred stock issued to Intrexon.
     The shares of our Series 1 preferred stock include a monthly dividend of 1% which shall accrue and be paid each month in the form of additional
shares of Series 1 preferred stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 3,063 shares of Series 1 preferred stock to Intrexon, the holder of all of the outstanding shares of our Series 1 preferred stock, as
dividends, representing monthly dividends due from June 30, 2016 through September 30, 2016. As a result of the monthly dividend, the number of shares of outstanding Series 1 preferred stock will increase each month that they are
outstanding. Since the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 1 preferred stock is based on the 20 day volume weighted average price of our common stock immediately prior to the public announcement of the first
approval in the United States of (i) a ZIOPHARM Product under the Channel Agreement, (ii) a Product under the GvHD Agreement or (iii) a Product under the Ares Trading Agreement, if, at the time of such public announcement, the 20 day
volume weighted average price of our common stock has not increased by more than the cumulative amount of the dividends on the shares of Series 1 preferred stock that we originally issued to Intrexon, then our common stockholders may experience
additional dilution as a result of the conversion of the Series 1 preferred stock into shares of our common stock.      *The holders of our Series 1
preferred stock are entitled to rights and preferences that are significantly greater than the rights and preferences of the holders of our common stock, including payments upon a liquidation event, as well as dividend and registration rights
associated with their shares.      The shares of Series 1 preferred stock that we issued to Intrexon in June 2016 in consideration for amending the
Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement are entitled to a number of rights and preferences which our common stock do not and will not have. Among these rights and preferences is the right to receive a portion of all funds to be distributed in
connection with a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or Deemed Liquidation Event, as defined in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series 1 preferred stock, or
the Certificate of Designation (which includes a change of control or the sale, lease transfer or exclusive license of all or substantially all of our assets), in proportion to the holders  proportionate share of our common stock on an
as-converted to common stock basis. For purposes of determining the Series 1 preferred stock s proportionate share on an as-converted basis in such a transaction, it would be assumed that the Series 1 preferred stock is convertible into a
number of shares of common stock equal to (i) the stated value of all outstanding shares of Series 1 preferred stock, divided by (ii) the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the 20-day period ending on the date of the
public announcement of such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or Deemed Liquidation Event, rounded down to the nearest whole share, unless such transaction occurred following the public announcement of
the first approval in the United States of a ZIOPHARM Product under the Channel Agreement, a Product under the GvHD Agreement or a Product under the Ares Trading Agreement, in which case the stated value would be divided by the volume weighted
average price of the Company s common stock for the 20-day period ending on the date of the public announcement such approval. We refer to this proportionate share allocated to the holders of Series 1 preferred stock as the Series 1 Liquidation
Amount. In addition, the Company may elect to redeem the shares of Series 1 preferred stock in connection with or following a Deemed Liquidation Event at a price per share equal to the Series 1 Liquidation Amount. Since the conversion rate is based
on the stated value of the shares of Series 1 preferred stock, which was initially $120 million and increases at a rate of 1% per month, the holders of shares of our Series 1 preferred stock could receive a disproportionate amount of the
proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or Deemed Liquidation Event if our stock price has not sufficiently increased prior to the time that their proportionate share is calculated. Further,
pursuant to the terms of a Securities Issuance Agreement we entered into with Intrexon in connection with the issuance of the Series 1 preferred stock, we agreed that the holders of common stock issued upon the conversion of the shares of Series 1
preferred stock issued to Intrexon shall be entitled to piggy-back registration rights with respect to any common stock registered by us following such conversion.

    *The Series 1 preferred stock contains protective provisions that may limit our business flexibility.
     For so long as any shares of Series 1 preferred stock are outstanding, we may not, without first obtaining the consent of the holders of at least
a majority of the Series 1 preferred stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class:      

amend our certificate of incorporation or the Certificate of Designation of the Series 1 preferred stock, in each case in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Series 1 preferred stock
in a manner that is more adverse than the effect on any other class or series of our capital stock;        

authorize, create, issue or obligate us to issue (by reclassification, merger or otherwise) any security (or any class or series thereof) that has any powers, preferences or rights senior to the Series 1 preferred stock
with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the payment of dividends or rights of redemption; or        

enter into any transaction (or series of related transactions) the effect of which would adversely affect the holders of the Series 1 preferred stock in a manner that is more adverse than the effect on any other class
or series of our capital stock.      As a result, we will not be able to take any of these actions without first seeking and obtaining the
approval of the holders of our Series 1 preferred stock. In addition, we may not be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all, even if we think that taking the action for which we seek approval is in our best interests. Any failure
to obtain such approval could harm our business and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.      * We may not be able to retain the
exclusive rights licensed to us by Intrexon Corporation to develop and commercialize products involving DNA administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer.    
 Under the Channel Agreement, we use Intrexon s technology directed towards in vivo expression of effectors in connection with the development of
Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, our cell therapy programs and generally to research, develop and commercialize products, in each case in which DNA is administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or
prophylaxis of cancer, which we collectively refer to as the Cancer Program. The Channel Agreement grants us a worldwide license to use patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing,
manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer, which we refer to collectively as the ZIOPHARM Products. Such
license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of ZIOPHARM Products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Subject to limited exceptions, we may not sublicense the rights described
without Intrexon s written consent. Under the Channel Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Cancer Program, including development, commercialization and certain aspects
of manufacturing of ZIOPHARM Products.    Intrexon may terminate the Channel Agreement if we fail to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize
ZIOPHARM Products or if we elect not to pursue the development of a Cancer Program identified by Intrexon that is a  Superior Therapy  as defined in the Channel Agreement. We may voluntarily terminate the Channel Agreement upon 90 days
written notice to Intrexon. Upon termination of the Channel Agreement, we may continue to develop and commercialize any ZIOPHARM Product that, at the time of commercialization:  

is being commercialized by us;        

has received regulatory approval;        

is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority; or        

is the subject of at least an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (in the case of a termination by Intrexon due to an uncured breach or a voluntary termination by us), or an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in the field (in
the case of a termination by us due to an uncured breach or a termination by Intrexon following an unconsented assignment by us or our election not to pursue development of a Superior Therapy);    
 Our obligation to pay 20% of net profits or revenue and 50% of sublicensing revenue or royalties with respect to these  retained  products will
survive termination of the Channel Agreement, as described further in Note 5 to our financial statements (Commitments and Contingencies), as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading   Business License Agreements,
Intellectual Property and Other Agreements Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement with Intrexon Corporation for the Cancer Programs   (such description in our Annual Report on Form 10-K does not describe changes effected pursuant to the
2016 ECP Amendment).    There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully perform under the Channel Agreement and if the Channel Agreement is
terminated it may prevent us from achieving our business objectives.

    * We will incur additional expenses in connection with our License Agreement with The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center      Pursuant to the MD Anderson License with MD Anderson, we, together with Intrexon, obtained an exclusive, worldwide
license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel CAR +  T cell, NK cell and TCR cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence
Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who was then at MD Anderson, as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under certain related technologies. Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, MD Anderson agreed to transfer to us certain existing research
programs described in the MD Anderson License and we, together with Intrexon, entered into a research and development agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we agreed to provide funding for certain research and development activities of MD
Anderson for a period of three years from the date of the MD Anderson License, in an amount between $15.0 and $20.0 million per year. In addition, we also expect to enter into additional collaboration and technology transfer agreements with MD
Anderson and Intrexon to accelerate technology and clinical development of these product candidates. We expect to increase the level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward as a result of each of these items.
   Although our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources takes into account our plans to develop the technology licensed from MD
Anderson and our obligations under the MD Anderson License, the MD Anderson License is still only beginning to be implemented, therefore the actual costs associated therewith may be significantly in excess of forecasted amounts. In addition to the
amount and timing of expenses related to our relationship with MD Anderson, our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, changes in the focus
and direction of our development programs, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the development of our product candidates and costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we exhaust
our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated, regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product
candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them.

    * We may not be able to retain the rights licensed to us and Intrexon by The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center to technologies relating to novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies and other related technologies.      Under
the MD Anderson License, we, together with Intrexon, received an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel
CAR +  T cell, NK cell and TCR cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who was then at MD Anderson, as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under
certain related technologies. When combined with Intrexon s technology suite and ZIOPHARM s clinically tested RheoSwitch Therapeutic System    interleukin-12 modules, the resulting
proprietary methods and technologies may help realize the promise of genetically modified CAR +  T cell and other immune cells by controlling cell expansion and activation in the body, minimizing
off-target and unwanted on-target effects and toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. The term of the MD Anderson License expires on the last to occur of (a) the expiration of all patents licensed thereunder, or (b) the twentieth
anniversary of the date of the MD Anderson License; provided, however, that following the expiration of the term, the Company and Intrexon shall then have a fully-paid up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable license to use the
licensed intellectual property thereunder.    After 10 years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 90-day cure period, MD Anderson will
have the right to convert the MD Anderson License into a non-exclusive license if we and Intrexon are not using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed intellectual property on a case-by-case basis. After five years from the
date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 180-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to terminate the MD Anderson License with respect to specific technology(ies) funded by the government or subject to a third party contract if we
and Intrexon are not meeting the diligence requirements in such funding agreement or contract, as applicable. Subject to a 30-day cure period, MD Anderson has the right to terminate the MD Anderson License if we and Intrexon fail to timely deliver
the shares due in consideration for the MD Anderson License. MD Anderson may also terminate the agreement with written notice upon material breach by us or Intrexon, if such breach has not been cured within 60 days of receiving such notice. In
addition, the MD Anderson License will terminate upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events for both us or Intrexon and may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of us, Intrexon and MD Anderson.  
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully perform under the MD Anderson License and if the MD Anderson License is terminated it may
prevent us from achieving our business objectives.      We have a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.    
 We have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful
commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:      

Continuing to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials;        

Participating in regulatory approval processes;        

Formulating and manufacturing products; and        

Conducting sales and marketing activities.      Our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our
Company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary product candidates, and undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our
product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.

    Because we currently neither have nor intend to establish internal research capabilities, we are dependent
upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and other researchers to sell or license us their product candidates and technology.    
 Proposing, negotiating, and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. We compete for partnering
arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, many of which have significantly more experience than we do, and have significantly more financial resources. Our competitors may have stronger
relationships with certain third parties including academic research institutions, with whom we are interested in collaborating and may have, therefore, a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with those third parties. We
may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.    We expect that any product candidate to
which we acquire rights will require significant additional development and other efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All drug product
candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. Even
if our product candidates are approved, they may not be economically manufactured or produced, or be successfully commercialized.    We actively evaluate
additional product candidates to acquire for development. Such additional product candidates, if any, could significantly increase our capital requirements and place further strain on the time of our existing personnel, which may delay or otherwise
adversely affect the development of our existing product candidates. We must manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively, and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative, and sales and marketing personnel. We
may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing.      We may not be able
to successfully manage our growth.      In the future, if we are able to advance our product candidates to the point of, and thereafter through,
clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide for these capabilities. Any future growth will place a significant strain on our
management and on our administrative, operational, and financial resources. Therefore, our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage
any future growth effectively. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems, and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our
business may be harmed.      Our business will subject us to the risk of liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
     Our contract research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that
our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the
event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and
regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require our contractors to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.      *We rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their
knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.      We are highly dependent on Dr. Laurence J.N. Cooper, our
Chief Executive Officer, Caesar J. Belbel, our Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Dr. Francois Lebel, our Chief Medical Officer, and Executive Vice President of Research and Development and our principal
scientific, regulatory, and medical advisors. Dr. Cooper s, Mr. Belbel s, and Dr. Lebel s employment are governed by written employment agreements. Dr. Cooper, Mr. Belbel, and Dr. Lebel may terminate
their employment with us at any time, subject, however, to certain non-compete and non-solicitation covenants. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of Dr. Cooper, Mr. Belbel, Dr. Lebel, or any of
our other key personnel, could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales, and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. We do not carry  key person  life insurance
policies on any of our officers or key employees.

    If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
     We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical and clinical research and testing, government regulation,
formulation and manufacturing, and eventually, sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense and we
cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be
harmed.      We may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability
lawsuits.      The testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves
against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products, if approved. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the
merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:      

Decreased demand for our product candidates;        

Injury to our reputation;        

Withdrawal of clinical trial participants;        

Withdrawal of prior governmental approvals;        

Costs of related litigation;        

Substantial monetary awards to patients;        

Product recalls;        

Loss of revenue; and        

The inability to commercialize our product candidates.      We currently carry clinical trial insurance and
product liability insurance. However, an inability to renew our policies or to obtain sufficient insurance at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products that we develop, alone or with collaborators.
     * Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.    
 Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable
to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event
were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could
result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events
relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of
confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.

   RISKS RELATED TO THE CLINICAL TESTING, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES
      If we are unable to obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, our business will
suffer.      We may not be able to obtain the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates, or any product candidate that we may acquire
or develop in the future for commercial sale. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions equivalent to the FDA to commercialize our
product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA a Biologics License Application, or BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its
intended use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA s regulatory requirements
typically takes many years, depending upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and will require substantial resources for research, development, and testing. We cannot predict whether our research, development, and clinical
approaches will result in drugs that the FDA will consider safe for humans and effective for their intended uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical
testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation, or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review.
Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:      

Delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;        

Impose costly procedures on us; and        

Diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.      Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the
FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates will severely undermine our
business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any potential revenue source, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate
or that we will obtain FDA approval if we are able to do so.    In foreign jurisdictions, we similarly must receive approval from applicable regulatory
authorities before we can commercialize any drugs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above.  
   Our product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials, which are very expensive and time-consuming. We cannot be certain when we will be able
to submit a BLA to the FDA and any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business.      Our product
candidates are in various stages of development and require extensive clinical testing. Notwithstanding our current clinical trial plans for each of our existing product candidates, we may not be able to commence additional trials or see results
from these trials within our anticipated timelines. As such, we cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit a BLA for regulatory approval of our product candidates or whether such a BLA will be accepted. Because we do not anticipate
generating revenues unless and until we submit one or more BLAs and thereafter obtain requisite FDA approvals, the timing of our BLA submissions and FDA determinations regarding approval thereof, will directly affect if and when we are able to
generate revenues.      * Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their
regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.    
 As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or
events, including potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release. If our product candidates or similar products or product candidates under development by third parties demonstrate unacceptable adverse events, we may be required to halt
or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. The FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.

  The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete
the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately or timely recognized or managed by the treating medical staff, particularly outside of the institutions that collaborate with us, as
toxicities resulting from our novel technologies may not be normally encountered in the general patient population and by medical personnel. We expect to have to train medical personnel using our product candidates to understand their side effect
profiles, both for our planned clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any product candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in adverse effects to patients,
including death.    Additionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side
effects caused by such products, including during any long-term follow-up observation period recommended or required for patients who receive treatment using our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result,
including:      

regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;        

regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;        

we may be required to create a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for
healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;        

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and        

our reputation may suffer.      Any of the foregoing could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market
acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved. Furthermore, any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.  
   *Our cell-based and gene therapy immuno-oncology products rely on the availability of reagents, specialized equipment, and other specialty materials and
infrastructure, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. For some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely or may rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors, which could impair our ability to
manufacture and supply our products.      Manufacturing our product candidates will require many reagents, which are substances used in our
manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics
production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and equipment used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under
current good manufacturing practices by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. We also do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on
acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing.  
 For some of these reagents, equipment, infrastructure, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of
vendors. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor
disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to
conduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business.    As we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect
that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to
alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are able to alter our process so as to use other materials or
equipment, such a change may lead to a delay in our clinical development and/or commercialization plans. If such a change occurs for product candidate that is already in clinical testing, the change may require us to perform both ex vivo
comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials.  
      63  

Table of Contents  

    The results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.    
 Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support approval of our product candidates. The FDA
normally expects two randomized, well-controlled Phase 3 pivotal studies in support of approval of an NDA or BLA. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot
be certain that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for
the indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our BLAs with the FDA and,
ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be
indicative of future results.      * Our immuno-oncology product candidates are based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the
time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. Currently, no gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and only one product has been approved in Europe.    
 We have recently focused our product research and development efforts on our immuno-oncology product candidates under our Channel Agreement with Intrexon.
These products, including Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, are based on gene therapy technology. Due to the novelty of this medical technology, there can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our
immuno-oncology platform will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience unanticipated problems or delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity or transferring our
manufacturing process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical studies or commercializing our immuno-oncology product candidates on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.  
 In addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety
and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive
and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only one gene therapy product, UniQure s Glybera, which received marketing authorization from the EMA in 2012, has been
approved in Europe but has not yet been launched for commercial sale, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or
Europe. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.    Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy
products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the
review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical studies conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from
the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities  Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may
proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an IND on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review.
Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the
trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.  
 These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to
perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations
or restrictions. As we advance our immuno-oncology product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue
development of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected for oncology product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in
obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.

    Because we are dependent upon clinical research institutions and other contractors for clinical testing and
for research and development activities, the results of our clinical trials and such research activities are, to a certain extent, beyond our control.    
 We materially rely upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our preclinical and clinical
trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue
them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA
applications, if any, and our introduction of new products, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors to our
detriment, our competitive position would be harmed.      Our reliance on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates exposes us
to a number of risks that may delay the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs.    
 We do not have experience in drug formulation or manufacturing of drugs or biologics and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. Although
we will work closely with and rely upon Intrexon on the manufacturing and scale-up of Intrexon product candidates, we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. We currently are contracting for the
manufacture of our product candidates. We intend to contract with one or more manufacturers to manufacture, supply, store, and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. If a product candidate we develop or acquire in the future receives FDA
approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors or Intrexon to manufacture our products. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:  

We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new
testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.    

Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our products in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any.    

Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute
our products.        

Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good
manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers  compliance with these regulations and standards.    

If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.    

Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with
applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or
products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.    
 Each of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product
candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues      * Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval
could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them
are approved.      Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data,
labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, among other things, submissions of safety and other
post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the
distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of
approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the
accompanying label may limit the approved uses, which could limit sales of the product.  
      65  

Table of Contents  

  The FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to
monitor the safety or efficacy of our approved products. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the
approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers  communications regarding off-label use and if we market our products outside of their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label
marketing. Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.  
 In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to
comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:      

Litigation involving patients taking our product;        

Restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;        

Restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;        

Restrictions on product distribution or use;        

Requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;        

Warning letters;        

Withdrawal of the products from the market;        

Refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;        

Recall of products;        

Fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;        

Suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;        

Damage to relationships with existing and potential collaborators;        

Unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;        

Refusal to permit the import or export of our products;        

Product seizure; or        

Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.      Noncompliance with similar European Union
requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements regarding the development of products for pediatric
populations and the protection of personal health information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.     RISKS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO
COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES       If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements
with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully.      We currently have no
marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. If and when we become reasonably certain that we will be able to commercialize our current or future product candidates, we anticipate allocating resources to the marketing, sales and distribution of
our proposed products in North America and in certain other countries; however, we cannot assure that we will be able to market, sell, and distribute our products successfully. Our future success also may depend, in part, on our ability to enter
into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities and to encourage the collaborator s strategic interest in the products under development, and such collaborator s ability to successfully market and sell any such
products. Although we intend to pursue certain collaborative arrangements regarding the sale and marketing of certain of our product candidates, there are no assurances that we will be able to establish or maintain collaborative arrangements or, if
we are able to do so, whether we would be able to conduct our own sales efforts. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution
capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition,
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our product candidates in the United States or overseas.    If we are not able to
partner with a third party and are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our product candidates, which would harm our business. If we
rely on pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable
terms or at all. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties that may not be successful and that will be only partially in our control.  
      66  

Table of Contents  

    If physicians and patients do not accept and use our product candidates, our ability to generate revenue
from sales of our products will be materially impaired.      Even if the FDA and/or foreign equivalents thereof approve our product candidates,
physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:      

Perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;        

Pharmacological benefit and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;        

Availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payors;        

Effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any; and        

The price at which we sell our products.      Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if
approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of a drug to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing in order to fund the development of
future product candidates.      Our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our products do not obtain coverage or adequate
reimbursement from payors.      Our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on
the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health maintenance organizations and health insurers and other third-party payors.  
 Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs
associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon
clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Even if we obtain coverage for our product candidates, the resulting
reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant
portion of the cost of our product candidates.  
      67  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, the market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend
significantly on access to third-party payors  drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. The
industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict
patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.    Third-party payors, whether foreign or
domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party
payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and
clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors,
physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our
profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.    In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the
European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary
widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal
products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may
face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products,
which could negatively impact our profitability.      *The market opportunities for our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are
ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small.      Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line, or
third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy,
usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small
molecules, or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery, and new technologies. We expect to initially seek approval of our
product candidates as a third line therapy for patients who have failed other approved treatments.    Subsequently, for those products that prove to be
sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval as a second line therapy and potentially as a first line therapy, but there is no guarantee that our product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for second line or first
line therapy. In addition, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials prior to gaining approval for second line or first line therapy.    Our
projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive third line therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product
candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new
studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may
not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory
approval for additional indications, including use as a first or second line therapy.

 Risks Related to Our Ability to Commercialize Our Product Candidates  If we cannot compete successfully for market share against other biopharmaceutical companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will
suffer .       *Healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
     In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory enactments in recent years
that change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our future ability to sell our product candidates profitably.    Furthermore, there have been
and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Most significantly, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which includes measures that significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to
the pharmaceutical industry are the following:      

An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government
healthcare programs;        

An increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;

A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage
gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;        

An extension of manufacturers  Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;    

New methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line
extensions;        

Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby
potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers  Medicaid rebate liability;    
      69  

Table of Contents  

Expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;        

A new requirement to annually report drug samples that certain manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians;        

Expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;    

A licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;        

A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and    

Establishment of a Center for Medicare   Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services, or CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and
Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.      We cannot predict the full impact of the ACA, as many of the reforms
require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, some of which have not yet fully occurred. Further, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will
be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.    In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was
enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The
Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation s automatic reductions to several government programs. These
reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional
Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug
pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The full impact of these new laws, as well as laws and other reform and cost containment
measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers and accordingly, our
ability to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.      *If we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws,
including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.    
 As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other
third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients  rights are and will be applicable to our business. For example, we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and
patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others:  

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by
prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable
under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;        

Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from
Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;        

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;        

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and
transmission of individually identifiable health information;    
      70  

Table of Contents  

Requirements to report annually to CMS certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any  transfer of value 
made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during
the preceding calendar year; and        

State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;
state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be
made to healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfer of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities; and state and foreign laws
governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts    
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business
activities, including our consulting agreements with physicians, some of whom receive stock or stock options as compensation for their services, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform
legislation has further strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have
actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false
or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.    To the extent that any of our product candidates is ultimately sold in a foreign country, we
may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations.    If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any
other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in United States federal or state health care programs, such as
Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance
programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to
incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.  
   * Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted.    
 We have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and research and development tax credits, or R D credits, as a result of our
incurrence of losses and our conduct of research activities since inception. We generally are able to carry NOLs and R D credits forward to reduce our tax liability in future years. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs and R D credits is
subject to the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, respectively. Those sections generally restrict the use of NOLs and R D credits after an  ownership change.  An ownership
change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under
Section 382 of the code and the United States Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of
the stock owned by these stockholders over the applicable testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carry forwards and
Section 383 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of tax a corporation may offset with business credit (including the R D credit) carry forwards. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable
expiration date for the respective NOL or R D credit carry forwards. We may have experienced an  ownership change  within the meaning of Section 382 in the past and there can be no assurance that we will not experience additional
ownership changes in the future. As a result, our NOLs and business credits (including the R D credit) may be subject to limitations and we may be required to pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our NOLs or R D
credits were freely usable.

    *Our immuno-oncology product candidates may face competition in the future from biosimilars.    
 With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Patient Protection and ACA, an abbreviated pathway
for the approval of follow-on biological products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as
 interchangeable  with an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. This data exclusivity does
not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the original branded product, generating its own data and seeking approval. Data exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely upon the data within the
innovator s application to support the biosimilar product s approval.    In his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, President Obama proposed to
cut this 12-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as  evergreening.  It is possible that
Congress may take these or other measures to reduce or eliminate periods of exclusivity.    Although final implementation of the BPCIA is not yet complete,
such FDA implementation could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.     RISKS RELATED TO OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY       * If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to
patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish and our ability to successfully commercialize our products may be impaired.    
 Our success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent
protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.
   To date, we have exclusive rights to certain U.S. and foreign intellectual property with respect to the Intrexon technology, including the existing
Intrexon product candidates, such as Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex, and the GvHD program, and with respect to CAR +  T, NK and TCR cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D.,
Ph.D., who was then at MD Anderson. Under our Channel Agreement with Intrexon, Intrexon has the sole right to conduct and control the filings, prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us. Although under the
agreement Intrexon has agreed to consider in good faith and consult with us regarding any comments we may have regarding these patents and patent applications, we cannot guarantee that our comments will be solicited or followed. Under the MD
Anderson License, future filings and applications require the agreement of each of MD Anderson, Intrexon and us, and MD Anderson has the right to control the preparation and filing of additional patent applications unless the parties agree that we
or Intrexon may prosecute the application directly. Although under the agreement MD Anderson has agreed to review and incorporate any reasonable comments that we or Intrexon may have regarding these patents and patent applications, we cannot
guarantee that our comments will be solicited or followed. Without direct control of the channel program patents and patent applications, we are dependent on Intrexon or MD Anderson, as applicable, to keep us advised of prosecution, particularly in
foreign jurisdictions where prosecution information may not be publicly available. We anticipate that we, Intrexon and MD Anderson will file additional patent applications both in the United States and in other countries. However, we cannot predict
or guarantee:      

The degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents;    

If and when patents will be issued;        

Whether or not others will obtain patents claiming subject matter related to or relevant to our product candidates; or        

Whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose.    
 The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at
a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some
circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. We may also require the cooperation of our
licensors in order to enforce the licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.

  The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex
legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may fail to seek or obtain
patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag
behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.  
 Changes in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or
narrow the scope of our patent protection. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law, resulting in a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These changes include
provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent
protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained, and with regard to our ability to
obtain patents in the future. As the U.S. PTO continues to implement the Leahy-Smith Act, and as the federal courts have the opportunity to interpret the Leahy-Smith Act, the laws and regulations governing patents, and the rules regarding patent
procurement could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.  
 Certain technologies utilized in our research and development programs are already in the public domain. Moreover, a number of our competitors have developed
technologies, filed patent applications or obtained patents on technologies, compositions and methods of use that are related to our business and may cover or conflict with our owned or licensed patent applications, technologies or product
candidates. Such conflicts could limit the scope of the patents that we may be able to obtain or may result in the rejection of claims in our patent applications. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are
typically not published until eighteen months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that
others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make
the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions
claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which
protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and
other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, our own earlier filed patents and applications or those of Intrexon may limit the scope of later patents we obtain or may result in the
rejection of claims in our later filed patent applications. If third parties filed patent applications or obtained patents on technologies, compositions and methods of use that are related to our business and that cover or conflict with our owned or
licensed patent applications, technologies or product candidates, we may be required to challenge such protection, terminate or modify our programs impacted by such protection or obtain licenses from such third parties, which might not be available
on acceptable terms, or at all.    Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us
with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative
technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.    The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or
enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed,
invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and
products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our
owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.

    If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position
would be harmed.      Our success also depends upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants
and advisors, as well as our licensors and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, and to maintain our competitive position, we rely on trade secret
protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, it is our general policy to require our employees, consultants, advisors, and contractors to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where
applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary
information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches of these agreements. Our trade secrets may also be
obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome
is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would
have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets,
know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.      Third-party claims of
intellectual property infringement would require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our products.    
 In order to protect or enforce patent rights, we, or Intrexon, may initiate patent infringement litigation against third parties. Similarly, we may be sued by
others for patent infringement. We also may become subject to proceedings conducted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including interference proceedings to determine the priority or derivation of inventions, or post-grant review,
inter partes review, or reexamination proceedings reviewing the patentability of our patented claims. In addition, any foreign patents that are granted may become subject to opposition, nullity, or revocation proceedings in foreign jurisdictions
having such proceedings. The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel away from their normal responsibilities.  
 Our research, development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be
claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Patents do not protect its owner from a claim of infringement of another owner s patent. Therefore, our patent position cannot and does not
provide any assurance that we are not infringing the patent rights of another.    The patent landscape in the field of immuno-oncology, which we are
pursuing under our Channel Agreement with Intrexon, is particularly complex. We are aware of numerous United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications of third parties that cover compositions, methods of use and methods of
manufacture of immuno-oncology, including biotherapeutics involving the in vivo expression of human IL-12. In addition, there may be patents and patent applications in the field of which we are not aware. The technology we license from Intrexon is
early-stage technology and we are just beginning the process of designing and developing products using this technology. Although we will seek to avoid pursuing the development of products that may infringe any patent claims that we believe to be
valid and enforceable, we may fail to do so. Moreover, given the breadth and number of claims in patents and pending patent applications in the field of immuno-oncology and the complexities and uncertainties associated with them, third parties may
allege that we are infringing upon patent claims even if we do not believe such claims to be valid and enforceable.    If a claim for patent infringement is
asserted, there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue marketing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful
conclusion. If we do not successfully defend any infringement actions to which we become a party or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages, which can be tripled if the
infringement is deemed willful, or be required to discontinue or significantly delay commercialization and development of the affected products.    Any
legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin developmental or marketing activities relating to affected products could, in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages, require us or our
collaborators to obtain licenses to continue to develop, manufacture, or market the affected products. Such a license may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  
 An adverse determination in a proceeding involving our owned or licensed intellectual property may allow entry of generic substitutes for our products.  
      74  

Table of Contents  

    Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document
submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.    
 Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the
patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many
cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete
loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time
limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.  
   If we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to products or technology from others, we could lose license rights that are material
to our business or be subject to claims by our licensors.      We license rights to products and technology that are important to our business, and we
expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For instance, we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications under our Channel Agreement, the ECP Agreement and the GvHD Agreement with Intrexon as well as under the MD Anderson
License. Under these agreements, we are subject to a range of commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, patent prosecution and maintenance, insurance and other obligations.  
 Any failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of our license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate
the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or business.
Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, such dispute could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of potential products and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. On
termination we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed.    In addition, in certain cases, the rights
licensed to us are rights of a third party licensed to our licensor. In such instances, if our licensors do not comply with their obligations under such licenses, our rights under our license agreements with our licensor may be adversely affected.
     We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming
ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.      Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other
biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to
claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.  
 In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute
agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be
self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.  
 If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or
personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.

Changes in accounting principles.      In addition, the stock market from time to time experiences significant
price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Capital Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to
affect the market prices of equity securities of many biopharmaceutical companies. Stock prices of many biopharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the
past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be
diverted from our business.

    We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley and the reporting requirements of federal securities laws, which can be
expensive.      As a public reporting company, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as to the information and reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and other federal securities laws. As a result, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company, including
costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements. As an example of public reporting company requirements, we evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and of our internal
control over financing reporting in order to allow management to report on such controls. Sarbanes-Oxley generally requires that a public reporting company s independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of the
company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, any updates to our finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls, which may be
required as a result of our ongoing analysis of internal controls, or results of testing by our independent auditor, may require significant time and expense. As a company with limited accounting resources, a significant amount of management s
time and attention has been and will continue to be diverted from our business to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements. This diversion of management s time and attention may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.    Management is working to continuously monitor and improve internal controls and has set in place controls
to mitigate the potential segregation of duties risk. In the event significant deficiencies or material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, or if we are unable to
receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and the
trading price of our common stock and ability to obtain any necessary equity or debt financing could suffer. In addition, in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls over financial
reporting in connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related
disclosures, we may be unable to file our periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. This would likely have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and our ability to secure any necessary
additional equity or debt financing, and could result in the delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market, which would severely limit the liquidity of our common stock.  
   Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders,
more difficult.      Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make
it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions authorize the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the
number of outstanding shares and hinder a takeover attempt, and limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from
engaging in a business combination with a party that owns at least 15% of its common stock unless the business combination is approved by the company s board of directors before the person acquires the 15% ownership stake or later by its board
of directors and two-thirds of its stockholders. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  
 In connection with our January 2011 issuance of shares of common stock to Intrexon in a private placement transaction, our board of directors waived the
Section 203 prohibition with respect to a future business combination with Intrexon.      Because we do not expect to pay dividends, you will not
realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until you sell your shares at profit.      We have never paid dividends on our
capital stock and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in us will be realized, if at all, only when you sell shares of our common stock.  
   If securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our
results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.      The trading market for our common stock
will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility
in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one
or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.

    *Our principal stockholders, executive officers and directors have substantial control over the company,
which may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may harm the market price of our common stock.    
 As of September 30, 2016, our executive officers, directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, beneficially owned, in
the aggregate, 10.0% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with our other stockholders and, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for
approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:  

Delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;        

Impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or        

Discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us
