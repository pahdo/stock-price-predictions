EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This report combines the reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   of American Campus Communities, Inc. and American Campus Communities Operating Partnership, L.P.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to  ACC  mean American Campus Communities, Inc., a Maryland real estate investment trust ( REIT ), and references to  ACCOP  mean American Campus Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership.  References to the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  mean collectively ACC, ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACC and/or ACCOP.  References to the  Operating Partnership  mean collectively ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACCOP. The following chart illustrates the Company s and the Operating Partnership s corporate structure: 

The general partner of ACCOP is American Campus Communities Holdings, LLC ( ACC Holdings ), an entity that is wholly-owned by ACC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , ACC Holdings held an ownership interest in ACCOP of less than 1%. The limited partners of ACCOP are ACC and other limited partners consisting of current and former members of management and nonaffiliated third parties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , ACC owned an approximate   99.1%   limited partnership interest in ACCOP.  As the sole member of the general partner of ACCOP, ACC has exclusive control of ACCOP s day-to-day management.  Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one business.  The management of ACC consists of the same members as the management of ACCOP.  The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ( UPREIT ) and ACC contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership.  In return for those contributions, ACC receives a number of units of the Operating Partnership ( OP Units,  see definition below) equal to the number of common shares it has issued in the equity offering.  Contributions of properties to the Company can be structured as tax-deferred transactions through the issuance of OP Units in the Operating Partnership.  Based on the terms of ACCOP s partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged for ACC s common shares on a one-for-one basis.  The Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units of the Operating Partnership issued to ACC and ACC Holdings and the common shares issued to the public.  The Company believes that combining the reports on Form 10-Q of ACC and ACCOP into this single report provides the following benefits: 
    
           (1) 
    enhances investors  understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
              (2) 
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
              (3) 
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

ACC consolidates ACCOP for financial reporting purposes, and ACC essentially has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in ACCOP.  Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.  However, the Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the entities operate as a consolidated company.  All of the Company s property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership.  ACC also issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of ACCOP, as disclosed in this report.  ACC does not have any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures.  The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.  Except for the net proceeds from ACC s equity offerings, which are contributed to the capital of ACCOP in exchange for OP Units on a one-for-one common share per OP Unit basis, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business.  These sources include, but are not limited to, the Operating Partnership s working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its credit facility, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  Noncontrolling interests, stockholders  equity, and partners  capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements consist of the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated joint ventures.  The noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and OP Unit holders of the Operating Partnership.  The differences between stockholders  equity and partners  capital result from differences in the equity issued at the Company and Operating Partnership levels. 
    
  To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership.  A single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements is presented that includes separate discussions for the Company and the Operating Partnership when applicable (for example, noncontrolling interests, stockholders  equity or partners  capital, earnings per share or unit, etc.).  A combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section is also included that presents discrete information related to each entity, as applicable.  This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4 Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C.  1350. 
    
  In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership.  In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.  Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company operates its business through the Operating Partnership.  The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

1  .      Organization and Description of Business    
    
  American Campus Communities, Inc. ( ACC ) is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that commenced operations effective with the completion of an initial public offering ( IPO ) on August 17, 2004.  Through ACC s controlling interest in American Campus Communities Operating Partnership, L.P. ( ACCOP ), ACC is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management.  ACC is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties.  ACC s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  ACC.  
    
  The general partner of ACCOP is American Campus Communities Holdings, LLC ( ACC Holdings ), an entity that is wholly-owned by ACC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , ACC Holdings held an ownership interest in ACCOP of less than   1%  . The limited partners of ACCOP are ACC and other limited partners consisting of current and former members of management and nonaffiliated third parties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , ACC owned an approximate   99.1%   limited partnership interest in ACCOP.  As the sole member of the general partner of ACCOP, ACC has exclusive control of ACCOP s day-to-day management.  Management operates ACC and ACCOP as one business.  The management of ACC consists of the same members as the management of ACCOP.  ACC consolidates ACCOP for financial reporting purposes, and ACC does not have significant assets other than its investment in ACCOP.  Therefore, the assets and liabilities of ACC and ACCOP are the same on their respective financial statements.  References to the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  mean collectively ACC, ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACC and/or ACCOP.  References to the  Operating Partnership  mean collectively ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACCOP.  Unless otherwise indicated, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Company and the Operating Partnership. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our property portfolio contained   170   properties with approximately   105,300   beds.  Our property portfolio consisted of   139   owned off-campus student housing properties that are in close proximity to colleges and universities,   26   American Campus Equity ( ACE  ) properties operated under ground/facility leases with   twelve   university systems and   five   on-campus participating properties operated under ground/facility leases with the related university systems.  Of the   170   properties,   eleven   were under development as of   September 30, 2016  , and when completed will consist of a total of approximately   9,000   beds.  Our communities contain modern housing units and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student-oriented programming, with many offering resort-style amenities. 
    
  Through   one   of ACC s taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ), we also provide construction management and development services, primarily for student housing properties owned by colleges and universities, charitable foundations, and others.  As of   September 30, 2016  , also through one of ACC s TRSs, we provided third-party management and leasing services for   35   properties that represented approximately   28,300   beds.  Third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from   one   to   five years  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total owned and third-party managed portfolio included   205   properties with approximately   133,600   beds. 

2  .      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. All material intercompany transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated. All dollar amounts in the tables herein, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts, are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated. Certain prior period amounts, as discussed below in Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  ,   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

  AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ),  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues where there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing whether ASU 2016-15 will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-05 ( ASU 2016-05 ),  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   The amendments in this guidance clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-05 as of January 1, 2017 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),  Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing whether ASU 2016-02 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),  Revenue From Contracts With Customers .  ASU 2014-09 provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts with customers (excluding certain contracts, such as lease contracts) to improve comparability within industries.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be paid in exchange for those goods and services and provide enhanced disclosures, all to provide more comprehensive guidance for transactions such as service revenue and contract modifications. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued multiple Accounting Standards Updates clarifying multiple aspects of the new revenue recognition standard, which include the deferral of the effective date by one year.  ASU 2014-09, as amended by subsequent Accounting Standards Updates, is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and may be applied using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. The Company plans to adopt the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new standards on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.  ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.   Refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for details on the impact of the reclassification of taxes paid on net-share settlements from operating to financing activities.  
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 ( ASU 2015-16 ),  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   Under the new guidance, the Company will no longer recognize a measurement-period adjustment retroactively in a business combination. Instead, measurement-period adjustments will be recognized during the period in which the amount of the adjustment is determined. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ),  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The impact of adopting ASU 2015-03 on the Company s consolidated financial statements was the

reclassification of deferred financing costs previously included in  other assets  to  secured mortgage, construction and bond debt ,  unsecured notes  and  unsecured term loans  within its consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented (see Note   7  ).  Other than these reclassifications, the adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 ( ASU 2015-02 ),  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   The new guidance changed the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance did not amend the existing disclosure requirements for Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest model entities.  The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model and eliminated the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.  Under the revised guidance, ACCOP is determined to be a VIE.  As ACCOP is already included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, the identification of this entity as a VIE has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.  There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of this guidance.  In addition, there were no other voting interest entities under prior existing guidance determined to be VIEs under the revised guidance.   
    
  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited, but have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements of the Company for these interim periods have been included.  Because of the seasonal nature of the Company s operations, the results of operations and cash flows for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for other interim periods or for the full year.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Investments in Real Estate 
    
  Investments in real estate are recorded at historical cost.  Major improvements that extend the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset.  The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred.  Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 
                   Buildings and improvements 
      
    7-40 years 
      Leasehold interest - on-campus 
     participating properties 
      
    25-34 years (shorter of useful life or respective lease term) 
      Furniture, fixtures and equipment 
      
    3-7 years 

Project costs directly associated with the development and construction of an owned real estate project, which include interest, property taxes, and amortization of deferred finance costs, are capitalized as construction in progress.  Upon completion of the project, costs are transferred into the applicable asset category and depreciation commences.  Interest totaling approximately   $3.3 million   and   $2.8 million   was capitalized during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and interest totaling approximately   $9.0 million   and   $8.2 million   was capitalized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Management assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of the Company s investments in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, or when a property meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, at which time an impairment charge is recognized for any excess of the carrying value

of the property over the expected net proceeds from the disposal.  The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions.  If such conditions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of the Company s long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the conditions change.  To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. The Company believes that there were no impairment indicators of the carrying values of its investments in real estate as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on relative fair values.  Fair value estimates are based on information obtained from a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio, and other market data.  Information obtained about each property as a result of due diligence, marketing and leasing activities is also considered.  The value allocated to land is generally based on the actual purchase price if acquired separately, or market research/comparables if acquired as part of an existing operating property.  The value allocated to building is based on the fair value determined on an  as-if vacant  basis, which is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The value allocated to furniture, fixtures, and equipment is based on an estimate of the fair value of the appliances and fixtures inside the units. We have determined these estimates to have been primarily based upon unobservable inputs and therefore are considered to be Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  We record the acquisition of undeveloped land parcels that do not meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations at the purchase price paid and capitalize the associated acquisition costs. 
    
  Pre-development Expenditures 
    
  Pre-development expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third-party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred, until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and/or construction will commence.  Because the Company frequently incurs these pre-development expenditures before a financing commitment and/or required permits and authorizations have been obtained, the Company bears the risk of loss of these pre-development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or the Company is unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations.  As such, management evaluates the status of third-party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and/or the costs may not provide future value to the Company in the form of revenues.  Such write-offs are included in third-party development and management services expenses (in the case of third-party development projects) or general and administrative expenses (in the case of owned development projects) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has deferred approximately   $9.0 million   in pre-development costs related to third-party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction.  Such costs are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Earnings per Share   Company 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed using net income attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflects common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of American Campus Communities Operating Partnership Units ( OP Units ) and common share awards granted.  Only those items having a dilutive impact on basic earnings per share are included in diluted earnings per share. 
    
  The following potentially dilutive securities were outstanding for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Earnings per Unit   Operating Partnership 
    
  Basic earnings per OP Unit is computed using net income attributable to common unitholders and the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per OP Unit reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue OP Units were exercised or converted into OP Units or resulted in the issuance of OP Units and then shared in the earnings of the Operating Partnership.

7  .      Debt    
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03, and as a result, deferred financing costs associated with secured mortgage, construction and bond debt, unsecured notes, and unsecured term loans are now subject to the new accounting guidance and are presented as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the debt.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation (see Note   2  ).  A summary of the Company s outstanding consolidated indebtedness is as follows:  

(1)             A loan relating to Stadium Centre Phase II was classified as a construction loan as of December 31, 2015 and is now reflected as a mortgage loan as of   September 30, 2016  , as construction of the property was completed and the property opened in August of 2016.  
      
  Pay-off of Mortgage and Construction Debt       
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company paid off approximately   $152.6 million   of fixed rate mortgage debt secured by   nine   wholly owned properties (The Lofts at Capital Garage, Aztec Corner, Jacob Heights, Campus Town, Campus Trails, Abbot Place, Burbank Commons  ,   Campus Corner, and Campus Way).  Included in this amount is   $70.4 million   of fixed rate mortgage debt at   four   held for sale properties (see Note   4  ).  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company paid off approximately   $162.7 million   of fixed rate mortgage debt secured by   eight   wholly-owned properties,   $37.4 million   of fixed rate mortgage debt prior to the sale of   four   properties, and   $44.6 million   of variable rate construction debt secured by   two   ACE properties.

Unsecured Notes 
    
  The Company has issued the following senior unsecured notes: 

The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually.  The terms of the unsecured notes include certain financial covenants that require the Operating Partnership to limit the amount of total debt and secured debt as a percentage of total asset value, as defined.  In addition, the Operating Partnership must maintain a minimum ratio of unencumbered asset value to unsecured debt, as well as a minimum interest coverage level.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. 
     
  Unsecured Credit Facility 
    
  The Company has an aggregate unsecured credit facility totaling   $850 million   which is comprised of unsecured term loans totaling   $350 million   and a   $500 million   unsecured revolving credit facility, which may be expanded by up to an additional   $500 million   upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.  On January 29, 2016, the Company refinanced   $150 million   of the   $350 million   term loan facility ( Term Loan I Facility ) by extending the maturity date for the   $150 million   portion from January 10, 2017 to March 29, 2021.  The remaining   $200 million   of the   $350 million   Term Loan I Facility matures on January 10, 2017 and can be extended to January 10, 2019 through the exercise of   two     12  -month extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  The maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility is March 1, 2018, and can be extended for an additional   12 months   to March 1, 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The   $250 million   term loan facility ( Term Loan II Facility ) was repaid in February 2016 using proceeds from the issuance of   17,940,000   common shares (see Note   8   for details). In connection with this payoff, the Company accelerated the amortization of   $1.1 million   of deferred financing costs related to the Term Loan II Facility.  
    
  Each loan bears interest at a variable rate, at the Company s option, based upon a base rate or one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR, plus, in each case, a spread based upon the Company s investment grade rating from either Moody s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard   Poor s Rating Group.  In February 2016, Standard   Poor's upgraded the Company's investment grade rating from BBB- to BBB and in May 2016 Moody's Investors Service upgraded its corporate credit rating on the Company from Baa3 to Baa2.  As a result of the credit rating upgrades, the spread on our unsecured credit facility decreased between   25   and   30   basis points.  The Company has entered into multiple interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling   $350 million   that effectively fix the interest rate to a weighted average annual rate of   0.88%   on the outstanding balance of the Term Loan I Facility.  Including the current spread of   1.20%   for the   $200 million   of the Term Loan I Facility, and a current spread of   1.10%   for the remaining   $150 million   of the Term Loan I Facility, the all-in weighted average annual rate on the Term Loan I Facility was   2.04%   at   September 30, 2016  .  Refer to Note   11   for more information on the interest rate swap contracts mentioned above.  Availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an  aggregate borrowing base amount  equal to   60%   of the value of the Company s unencumbered properties, calculated as set forth in the unsecured credit facility.  Additionally, the Company is required to pay a facility fee of   0.20%   per annum on the   $500 million   revolving credit facility.  As of September 30, 2016, the revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of   1.83%   (  0.53%   +   1.10%   spread +   0.20%   facility fee), and availability under the revolving credit facility totaled   $480 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The terms of the unsecured credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants, which limit, among other items, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, and the disposition of assets.  The facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain minimum ratios of  EBITDA  (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to fixed charges and total indebtedness.  The Company may not pay distributions that exceed a specified percentage of funds from operations, as adjusted, for any four consecutive quarters.  The financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

  Stockholders' Equity - Company 
    
  On February 5, 2016, ACC completed an equity offering, consisting of the sale of   17,940,000   shares of ACC s common stock at a price of   $41.25   per share, including   2,340,000   shares issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters  overallotment option in full at closing. The offering generated gross proceeds of approximately   $740.0 million  .  The aggregate proceeds to ACC, net of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, were approximately   $707.3 million  . 
    
  In June 2015, the Company established an at-the-market share offering program (the  ATM Equity Program ) through which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to   $500 million  .  The shares that may be sold under this program include shares of common stock of the Company with an aggregate offering price of approximately   $194 million   that were not sold under the company's prior ATM program that expired in May 2015.  Actual sales under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company.   
    
  The following table presents activity under the Company s ATM Equity Program during three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $436.8 million   available for issuance under its ATM Equity Program. 
    
  In 2015, the Company established a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ( Deferred Compensation Plan ) maintained for the benefit of select employees and members of the Company s Board of Directors, in which vested share awards (see Note   10  ), salary and other cash amounts earned may be deposited.   Deferred Compensation Plan assets are held in a rabbi trust, which is subject to the claims of the Company s creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency.  The shares held in the Deferred Compensation Plan are classified within stockholders  equity in a manner similar to the manner in which treasury stock is classified.  Subsequent changes in the fair value of the shares are not recognized. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   10,026   shares of ACC's common stock were deposited into the Deferred Compensation Plan, bringing total ACC shares held in the Deferred Compensation Plan to   20,181   as of   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Partners  Capital   Operating Partnership 
    
  In connection with the equity offering and ATM Equity Program discussed above, ACCOP issued a number of American Campus Operating Partnership Common OP Units ( Common OP Units ) to ACC equivalent to the number of common shares issued by ACC.

  Operating Partnership 
    
  Partially-owned properties:   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership consolidates   three   joint ventures that own and operate University Village at Sweet Home, University Centre and Villas at Chestnut Ridge owned-off campus properties.  The portion of net assets attributable to the third-party partners in these joint ventures is classified as  noncontrolling interests - partially owned properties  within capital on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership.  Accordingly, the third-party partners  share of the income or loss of the joint ventures is reported on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income of the Operating Partnership as  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   partially owned properties.

As discussed in Note   3  , in July 2015, the Company entered into a pre-sale agreement with a private developer whereby the Company was obligated to purchase The Court at Stadium Centre.  The property, a VIE, was consolidated for financial purposes prior to the acquisition date. The initial   $7.3 million   equity contribution from the developer was reflected as noncontrolling interest - partially owned properties within capital on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership as of   December 31, 2015  .  The Company completed the purchase of the property in May 2016 and the property opened for operations in August 2016. 
    
  OP Units  :  For the portion of OP Units that the Operating Partnership is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered common shares of ACC to the exchanging OP unit holder, or for which the Operating Partnership has the intent or history of exchanging such units for cash, we classify the units as  redeemable limited partners  in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership. The units classified as such include Series A Preferred Units ( Preferred OP Units ) as well as common OP units that are not held by ACC or ACC Holdings. The value of redeemable limited partners on the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership is reported at the greater of fair value, which is based on the closing market value of the Company's common stock, or historical cost at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the value from period to period are charged to limited partners' capital on the consolidated statement of changes in capital of the Operating Partnership.  
    
  Below is a table summarizing the activity of redeemable limited partners for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :   

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   135,000   Common OP Units and   31,846     Preferred OP Units were converted into an equal number of shares of ACC s common stock and during the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   118,474   Common OP Units and   1,000   Preferred OP Units were converted into an equal number of shares of ACC s common stock.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   0.9%   and   1.2%  , respectively, of the equity interests of the Operating Partnership were held by owners of Common OP Units and Preferred OP Units not held by ACC or ACC Holdings. 
    
  Company 
    
  The noncontrolling interests of the Company include the third-party equity interests in partially-owned properties, as discussed above, which are presented as a component of equity in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company s noncontrolling interests also include the redeemable limited partners presented in the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership, which are referred to as  redeemable noncontrolling interests  in the mezzanine section of the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  Noncontrolling interests on the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income include the income/loss attributable to third-party equity interests in partially-owned properties, as well as the income/loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests (i.e. OP Units not held by ACC or ACC Holdings.) 

10  .      Incentive Award Plan    
    
  Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) 
    
  Upon reelection to the Board of Directors in May 2016, all members of the Company s Board of Directors were granted RSUs in accordance with the American Campus Communities, Inc. 2010 Incentive Award Plan (the  Plan ).  These RSUs were valued at   $150,000   for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and at   $105,000   for all other members.  The number of RSUs was determined based on the fair market value of the Company s stock on the date of grant, as defined in the Plan.  All awards vested and settled immediately on the date of grant, and the Company delivered shares of common stock and cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  In addition, the Company appointed a new member to the Board of Directors in September 2016 and granted RSUs valued at   $105,000  .  A compensation charge of approximately   $0.9 million   was recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to these awards.

  A summary of RSAs under the American Campus Communities, Inc. 2010 Incentive Award Plan (the  Plan ) as of   September 30, 2016   and activity during the   nine   months then ended, is presented below: 

(1)      Includes shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon vesting.             
    
  The fair value of RSAs is calculated based on the closing market value of ACC s common stock on the date of grant.  The fair value of these awards is amortized to expense over the vesting periods, which amounted to approximately   $2.2 million   and   $1.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.1 million   and   $5.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

11  .      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    
    
  The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.  The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  Forward starting swaps are used to protect the Company against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing its exposure to variability in cash flows relating to interest payments on a forecasted issuance of debt.  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.  Ineffectiveness resulting from the derivative instruments summarized below was immaterial for both the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The following table summarizes the Company s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as of   September 30, 2016  :  

In January 2016, the Company refinanced a portion of the Term Loan Facility I (See Note   7   for details).  While the maturity of a portion of the Term Loan Facility I was extended to March 29, 2021, there were no changes to the timing and amounts of the cash flows received or paid under the interest rate swaps, which will expire on the original maturity date. As a result, the Company concluded that a dedesignation of the original hedge relationship was not required. 
  In March 2014, the Company entered into   two   forward starting interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling   $200 million   designated to hedge the Company's exposure to increasing interest rates related to interest payments on an anticipated issuance of unsecured notes.  In connection with the issuance of unsecured notes in June 2014, the Company terminated both swap contracts resulting in payments to both counterparties totaling approximately   $4.1 million  , which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the unsecured notes.  When including the effect of these interest rate swap terminations, the effective yield on the unsecured notes is   4.27%  .  During both the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015     $0.1 million   was amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense, and during both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015     $0.3 million   was amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $3.2 million   and   $3.5 million   of the   $4.1 million   payment remained to be amortized, respectively. 
    
  The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

12  .       Fair Value Disclosures    
    
  The following table presents information about the Company s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.  In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the Company has the ability to access.  Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
    
  In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined is based on the lowest level input

significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
    
  Disclosures concerning financial instruments measured at fair value are as follows:  

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps, for nontrading purposes.  The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk arising from previously unhedged interest payments associated with variable rate debt and forward starting swaps to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows relating to interest payments on forecasted issuances of debt.  Through   September 30, 2016  , derivative financial instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges.  Derivative contracts with positive net fair values inclusive of net accrued interest receipts or payments are recorded in other assets.  Derivative contracts with negative net fair values, inclusive of net accrued interest payments or receipts, are recorded in other liabilities.  The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.  The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts).  The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. 
    
  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds and guarantees. 
    
  Although the Company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparty.  However, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company s derivative financial instruments.  As a result, the Company has determined each of its derivative valuations in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company (redeemable limited partners in the Operating Partnership) have a redemption feature and are marked to their redemption value.  The redemption value is based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the redemption date, and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the balance sheet date.  Since the valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, these instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, Student Contracts Receivable, Other Assets, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities:    The Company estimates that the carrying amount approximates fair value, due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Derivative Instruments:   These instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value, which is based on calculations provided by independent, third-party financial institutions and represent the discounted future cash flows expected, based on the projected future interest rate curves over the life of the instrument. 
    
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility:   The fair value of this instrument approximates carrying value due to the variable interest rate feature. 
    
  Loans Receivable:    The fair value of loans receivable is based on a discounted cash flow analysis consisting of scheduled cash flows and discount rate estimates to approximate those that a willing buyer and seller might use.  These financial instruments utilize Level 3 inputs. 
    
  Unsecured Notes:   In calculating the fair value of unsecured notes, interest rate and spread assumptions reflect current creditworthiness and market conditions available for the issuance of unsecured notes with similar terms and remaining maturities.  These financial instruments utilize Level 2 inputs. 
    
  Mortgage Loans:   The fair value of mortgage loans is based on the present value of the cash flows at current market interest rates through maturity.  The Company has concluded the fair value of these financial instruments are Level 2, as the majority of the inputs used to value these instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Bonds:   The fair value of bonds is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active due to the unique characteristics of these financial instruments; as such, the Company has concluded the inputs used to measure fair value fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The table below contains the estimated fair value and related carrying amounts for the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

(1)        
    Management s estimate of the collectability of principal and interest payments under the company s loans receivable from CaPFA Capital Corp. 2000F ( CaPFA ), which mature in December 2040, are highly dependent on the future operating performance of the properties securing the loans.  As future economic conditions and/or market conditions at the properties change, management will continue to evaluate the collectability of such amounts.  The Company believes there were no impairments of the carrying value of its loans receivable as of   September 30, 2016  . 
               (2)        
    Both the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of unsecured notes, mortgage loans, and bonds includes unamortized deferred financing costs (see Note   7  ).

13  .      Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Commitments 
    
  Construction Contracts:   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates additional costs to complete   eleven   wholly-owned development projects under construction to be approximately   $416.6 million  .  The Company expects to fund this amount through a combination of net proceeds from the February equity offering discussed in Note   8  , cash flows generated from operations, and proceeds from completed and anticipated property dispositions.   
    
  Development-related Guarantees:   For certain of its third-party development projects, the Company commonly provides alternate housing and project cost guarantees, subject to force majeure. These guarantees are typically limited, on an aggregate basis, to the amount of the projects  related development fees or a contractually agreed-upon maximum exposure amount.  Alternate housing guarantees typically expire within   five   days of scheduled completion, as defined, and generally require the Company to provide substitute living quarters and transportation for students to and from the university if the project is not complete by an agreed-upon completion date. Under project cost guarantees, the Company is responsible for the construction cost of a project in excess of an approved budget. The budget consists primarily of costs included in the general contractors  guaranteed maximum price contract ( GMP ). In most cases, the GMP obligates the general contractor, subject to force majeure and approved change orders, to provide completion date guarantees and to cover cost overruns and liquidated damages. In addition, the GMP is typically secured with payment and performance bonds. Project cost guarantees expire upon completion of certain developer obligations, which are normally satisfied within   one   year after completion of the project.  For   two   of its third-party development projects that are currently under construction with the same University system, the Company s obligation to pay alternate housing costs and excess project costs are unlimited in amount.  However, if the Company s payment obligation arises from force majeure or is caused by the owner, the owner agrees to reimburse the Company from future cash flow of the project.  If the Company s obligation is a result of the general contractor and/or design professionals  negligence, the owner agrees to assign its right to recover from such party to the Company. Additionally, for these   two   projects, the Company s exposure to such costs resulting from owner-caused delays, as defined, is limited to   $1.5 million  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , management did not anticipate any material deviations from schedule or budget related to third-party development projects currently in progress. 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various development-related purchase commitments with parties that provide development-related goods and services.  In the event that the Company was to terminate development services prior to the completion of projects under construction, the Company could potentially be committed to satisfy outstanding purchase orders with such parties.    
    
  In August 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to convey fee interest in a parcel of land, on which one of our student housing properties resides (University Crossings), to Drexel University (the  University ).  Concurrent with the land conveyance, the Company as lessee entered into a ground lease agreement with the University as lessor for an initial term of   40 years  , with   three     10  -year extensions, at the Company s option.  The Company also agreed to convey the building and improvements to the University at an undetermined date in the future and to pay real estate transfer taxes not to exceed   $2.4 million  .  The Company paid approximately   $0.6 million   in real estate transfer taxes upon the conveyance of land to the University, leaving approximately   $1.8 million   to be paid by the Company upon the transfer of the building and improvements.    
    
  In addition, in connection with certain property acquisitions, the Company has assumed the obligation to fund future infrastructure improvements located near the acquired properties.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company paid out   $0.1 million   related to this obligation.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has accrued   $0.5 million   related to this obligation which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Should additional obligations arise, it is likely that such payments made by the Company will be expensed at such time the local municipalities decide to move forward with the projects.   
    
  Contingencies 
    
  Litigation:    The Company is subject to various claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, as well as other matters that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  While it is not possible to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such matters, management believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.  However, the outcome of claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty.

Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. 
    
  Letters of Intent:    In the ordinary course of the Company s business, the Company enters into letters of intent indicating a willingness to negotiate for acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures.  Such letters of intent are non-binding, and neither party to the letter of intent is obligated to pursue negotiations unless and until a definitive contract is entered into by the parties.  Even if definitive contracts are entered into, the letters of intent relating to the acquisition and disposition of real property and resulting contracts generally contemplate that such contracts will provide the acquirer with time to evaluate the property and conduct due diligence, during which periods the acquirer will have the ability to terminate the contracts without penalty or forfeiture of any deposit or earnest money.  There can be no assurance that definitive contracts will be entered into with respect to any matter covered by letters of intent or that the Company will consummate any transaction contemplated by any definitive contract.  Furthermore, due diligence periods for real property are frequently extended as needed.  Once the due diligence period expires, the Company is then at risk under a real property acquisition contract, but only to the extent of any earnest money deposits associated with the contract. 
    
  Environmental Matters:    The Company is not aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The existence of any such material environmental liability could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and cash flows.  

14  .      Segments    
    
  The Company defines business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided.  The Company has identified   four   reportable segments: Wholly-Owned Properties, On-Campus Participating Properties, Development Services, and Property Management Services.  Management evaluates each segment s performance based on operating income before depreciation, amortization, minority interests and allocation of corporate overhead.  Intercompany fees are reflected at the contractually stipulated amounts.

Refer to Note   4   in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our recent disposition activity.  
    
  Third-Party Development Services 
    
  Through ACC s TRS entities, we provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by colleges and universities, charitable foundations and others.  During the third quarter   2016   we completed, delivered and commenced management of The Nest, a 440-bed third party development project on the campus of Northeastern Illinois University. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were under contract on three third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $5.3 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , fees of approximately $1.7 million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates ranging from December 2016 through August 2017.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we also earned $0.5 million in fees for the performance of various predevelopment activities at the University of Kansas.  This concludes the Company's role in this transaction.

Results of Operations 
    
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table presents our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods.   

34 

Same Store and New Property Operations 
    
  We define our same store property portfolio as wholly-owned properties that were owned and operating for both of the full years ended   December 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development or redevelopment activities, and are not classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .  Prior to the third quarter of 2016, we included properties classified as held for sale in our same store property portfolio.  We revised the definition of our same store property portfolio during the third quarter of 2016 to exclude such properties in order to better reflect the operating results of our ongoing portfolio. 
    
  Same store revenues are defined as revenues generated from our same store portfolio and consist of rental revenue earned from student leases as well as other income items such as utility income, damages, parking income, summer conference rent, application and administration fees, income from retail tenants, and income earned by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ) from ancillary activities such as the provision of food services. 
    
  Same store operating expenses are defined as operating expenses generated from our same store portfolio and include usual and customary expenses incurred to operate a property such as payroll, maintenance, utilities, marketing, general and administrative costs, insurance, property taxes, and bad debt.  Same store operating expenses also include an allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight. 
    
  A reconciliation of our same store, new property and sold/held for sale property operations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set forth below:  

(1)   
    Does not include properties under construction or undergoing redevelopment. 
               (2)   
    Includes   19   properties classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .  One of the properties held for sale consists of two phases which are counted separately in the property portfolio numbers above.  Refer to Note   4   in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our recent disposition activity. 
               (3)   
    Includes two wholly-owned properties that were sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the properties classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , as described above.  Also includes three wholly-owned properties that were sold during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .   
               (4)   
    Includes revenues which are reflected as resident services revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
       
  Same Store Properties  .  The increase in revenue from our same store properties was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the 2016/2017 academic year, as well as an increase in our weighted average occupancy from 91.2% during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to 92.1% during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2016/2017 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2017/2018 academic year at our various properties. 
    
  The increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to:  (i) an increase in general and administrative costs primarily due to an increase in the allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight due to growth in our wholly-owned property portfolio; (ii) an increase in property taxes due to higher than anticipated property tax assessments in various markets; and (iii) an increase in utilities expense as a result of unusual charges at multiple properties and the implementation of a roommate utility billing program at certain properties.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense as a result of occurrences at three properties during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 for the reasons discussed above as well as general inflation. 

35 

New Property Operations.    Our new properties for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are summarized in the table below: 

On-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP ) Operations 
    
  Same Store OCPP Properties.    We had five participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Revenues from these properties   increased   from   $6.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $6.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $0.2 million  .  This   increase   was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 69.8% for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to 57.1% for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Occupancy at our on-campus participating properties is low during the summer months due to the expiration of the 9-month leases concurrent with the end of the spring semester.  Operating expenses for these properties   increased   by   $0.2 million   from   $3.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to   $3.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in utilities as compared to the prior year.  Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2016/2017 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2017/2018 academic year. 
    
  Third-Party Development Services Revenue 
    
  Third-party development services revenue   decreased   by approximately $0.1 million, from   $0.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million, as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   in which we had three projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.9 million.   
    
  Development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the  
  
   36 

extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. 
    
  Third-Party Development and Management Services Expenses 
    
  Third-party development and management services expenses   decreased   by approximately $0.3 million, from   $3.6 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   decrease   was due to a decrease in the allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight, as a result of growth in our wholly-owned property portfolio.  We anticipate third-party development and management services expenses for the full year 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 as the decrease discussed above will be offset by increases due to new management contracts awarded in 2015 and 2016, an increase in the level of pursuits for third-party development projects, and general inflation.  
  General and Administrative 
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased   by approximately   $0.3 million  , from   $5.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $5.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating system platforms, additional payroll, health care and benefits expense, public company costs and other general inflationary factors. We anticipate general and administrative expenses for the full year 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 for the reasons discussed above. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization   increased   by approximately   $0.2 million  , from   $51.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $52.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to the following: (i) a $3.4 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of four owned development properties in August and September 2015 and seven in August and September of 2016; (ii) a $0.4 million increase due to renovation activity occurring at one of our wholly-owned properties; (iii) a $0.1 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2016; and (iv) $0.1 million of additional corporate depreciation and amortization expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .      These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to the following: (i) a $3.4 million decrease related to a portfolio of 19 properties classified as held for sale, as we stopped recording depreciation and amortization once the properties were classified as held for sale on August 1, 2016; and (ii) a $0.5 million decrease related to the sale of two properties in the first three months of 2016 and 20 properties in 2015.  We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to decrease for the full year 2016 as compared to 2015, as additional depreciation and amortization resulting from properties acquired in 2015 and 2016 and the completion of owned development projects in Fall 2015 and Fall 2016 will be more than offset by actual and anticipated disposition activity. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense decreased by approximately $2.1 million, from   $21.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $19.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Interest expense decreased as a result of the following:  (i) a decrease of approximately $2.4 million due to the payoff of our revolving credit facility and our $250 million term loan using proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering; (ii) a $1.1 million decrease related to the payoff of mortgage loans during 2015 and 2016; (iii) a $0.7 million decrease related to the payoff of maturing mortgage loans in our portfolio of 19 properties classified as held for sale; (iv) a $0.5 million increase in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable three month periods; (v) a $0.4 million decrease related to lower outstanding balances on our mortgage debt due to continued scheduled principal payments; and (vi) a $0.2 million decrease related to the disposition of one property with outstanding mortgage debt during 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $3.1 million during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   related to our September 2015 $400 million offering of senior unsecured notes and approximately $0.2 million of additional interest incurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   related to loans assumed in connection with 2015 property acquisitions.  We anticipate interest expense for the full year 2016 will decrease as compared to 2015 for the reasons discussed above. 

37 

Gain from Disposition of Real Estate 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we sold three wholly-owned properties containing 1,200 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately   $4.7 million  .  There were no dispositions during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Other Nonoperating Income 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized an insurance gain of   $0.4 million   related to a fire that occurred at one of our properties in 2014. 

38 

Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table presents our results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods. 

39 

Same Store and New Property Operations 
    
  A reconciliation of our same store, new property and sold/held for sale property operations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set forth below: 

(1)   
    Does not include properties under construction or undergoing redevelopment as of   September 30, 2016  .  The number of properties and beds as of   September 30, 2015   and revenues and expenses for the nine months then ended include properties for which redevelopment activities had not yet commenced. 
               (2)   
    Includes two wholly-owned properties that were sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with   19   properties classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .  One of the properties classified as held for sale consists of two phases which are counted separately in the property portfolio numbers above.  Refer to Note   4   in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our recent disposition activity. 
               (3)   
    Includes the two wholly-owned properties that were sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , along with the properties classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , as described above.  It also includes 20 wholly-owned properties that were sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    
               (4)   
    Includes revenues which are reflected as resident services revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
       
  Same Store Properties  .  The increase in revenue from our same store properties was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 academic years in addition to an increase in weighted average occupancy from 93.7%     during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to 93.9% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to the same factors that contributed to the increase in operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as discussed above, as well as an increase in general and administrative expense due to residence life fees paid to a university partner in association with a master lease agreement, and additional marketing expenses incurred due to our effort to achieve our leasing targets.  
    
  New Property Operations.    Our new properties for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are summarized in the table of new properties contained in the discussion of our results of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  On-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP ) Operations 
    
  Same Store OCPP Properties.    We had five participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Revenues from these properties   increased   by   $1.5 million  , from   $21.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $23.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 71.6% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to 69.5% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Operating expenses at these properties   increased   by $0.9 million, from   $9.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to   $10.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in utilities as compared to the prior year.  

40 

Third-Party Development Services Revenue 
    
  Third-party development services revenue   increased   by approximately $0.7 million, from   $3.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was due to the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year.  These two projects contributed approximately $2.0 million in additional revenue during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  In addition, we earned a $0.5 million fee for the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University on Kansas during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  These increases were partially offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of the development project at Northeastern Illinois University in May 2015, which contributed $1.3 million of revenue during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million, as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $2.2 million.   
    
  Third-Party Management Services Revenue 
    
  Third-party management services revenue   increased   by approximately $0.4 million, from   $6.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $7.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily a result of revenue earned from newly awarded management contracts, and the recognition of incentive fees from an existing third-party management contract during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We anticipate an increase in third-party management services revenue for the full year   2016   as compared to 2015 from new contracts obtained in 2015 and 2016, which will be slightly offset by the discontinuance of other management contracts.  
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased   by approximately   $1.1 million  , from   $15.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $16.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to the same factors that contributed to the increase for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as discussed above.  
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization   increased   by approximately   $5.4 million  , from   $154.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $159.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to the following: (i) a $6.9 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of four owned development properties in August and September 2015; (ii) a $1.8 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of seven owned development properties in August and September 2016; (iii) a $2.3 million increase due to property acquisition activity in   2015   and   2016  ; (iv) a $2.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization at our same store properties; (v) renovation activities occurring at one of our wholly-owned properties, which contributed approximately $1.3 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ; and (vi) a $0.4 increase in depreciation of corporate assets.  These increases were offset by (i) a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $5.1 million related to the sale of two properties in the first quarter   2016   and 20 properties in   2015  ; (ii) a $3.2 million decrease related to a portfolio of 19 properties classified as held for sale, as we stopped recording depreciation and amortization once the properties were classified as held for sale on August 1, 2016; and (iii) $0.9 million of depreciation expense incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to a property that was subsequently demolished, redeveloped and opened for operations in August 2016.  
    
  Ground/Facility Leases 
    
  Ground/facility leases expense   increased   by approximately   $0.9 million  , from   $5.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $6.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  This   increase   was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2015 and Fall 2016, as well as an increase in variable lease expense at two other ACE properties as a result of improved rental income.  We anticipate ground/facility leases expense to increase for the full year   2016   as compared to   2015   for the reasons discussed above.   
    
  Interest Income  
    
  Interest income   increased   by approximately   $0.7 million  , from   $3.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   This   increase   is primarily due to interest earned on cash proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering.   

41 

Interest Expense  
    
  Interest expense decreased by approximately $1.8 million, from   $63.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $61.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Interest expense decreased as a result of the following: (i) a decrease of approximately $5.4 million due to the paydown of our revolving credit facility and our $250 million term loan using proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering; (ii) a decrease of $3.4 million related to the payoff of mortgage loans during 2015 and 2016; (iii) a decrease of approximately $2.4 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to the disposition of properties with outstanding mortgage debt during   2015   and   2016  ; (iv) an increase of $0.8 million in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable nine month periods; (v) an $0.8 million decrease related to the payoff of maturing mortgage loans in our portfolio of 19 properties classified as held for sale; and (vi) a decrease of $0.5 million related to lower outstanding balances on our mortgage debt due to continued scheduled principal payments.  These decreases were mostly offset by the following (i) an increase of approximately $9.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to our $400 million offering of senior unsecured notes, which closed in September 2015; and (ii) approximately $1.5 million of additional interest related to loans assumed in connection with 2015 property acquisitions.  
    
  Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Amortization of deferred financing costs increased by approximately   $1.2 million  , from   $4.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This increase was primarily due to $1.1 million of accelerated amortization related to the payoff of our   $250 million   term loan facility in February 2016.  
    
  Gain from Disposition of Real Estate 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold two wholly-owned properties containing   1,324   beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately   $17.4 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we sold 20 wholly-owned properties containing 12,297 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately   $52.7 million  .   
    
  Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $1.8 million   of losses associated with the early pay off of four mortgage loans in connection with the sale of four wholly-owned properties. 
     
  Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Noncontrolling interests represent holders of common and preferred units in our Operating Partnership not held by ACC or ACC Holdings as well as certain third-party partners in joint ventures consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes.  Accordingly, these external partners are allocated their share of income/loss during the respective reporting periods.  Refer to Note   9   in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for a detailed discussion of noncontrolling interests.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Balances and Cash Flows 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , excluding our on-campus participating properties, we had $50.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to $38.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of   December 31, 2015  .  Restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits, as required by law in certain states, and funds held in escrow in connection with potential acquisition and development opportunities.  The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 1. 
    
  Operating Activities:   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was approximately   $242.8 million  , as compared to approximately   $178.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $63.9 million  .  This increase in cash flows was due to the timing of collections of our student accounts receivable, as well as operating cash flows provided by property acquisitions in 2015, the completion of construction and opening of seven owned development projects in the third quarter of 2016, and the completion of four owned development projects in 2015, which more than offset the decrease in operating cash flows related to the sale of 22 properties during 2015 and 2016. 
  
   42 

Investing Activities:    Investing activities utilized approximately   $365.7 million   and   $130.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The   $235.1 million     increase   in cash utilized in investing activities was primarily a result of the  following:  (i) a   $354.6 million   decrease in proceeds from the disposition of wholly owned properties, as we sold 20 properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as compared to two properties during the comparable nine month period in 2016; (ii) a   $144.1 million   increase in cash used to fund the construction of our wholly-owned development properties, related to the timing of construction commencement and completion of our owned development pipeline; (iii) a   $7.8 million   increase in cash used for investment in direct financing leases related to the construction of multi-purpose space at two ACE projects that are being subleased by the universities; and (iv) a   $4.3 million   increase in cash used to fund capital reserves.  These increases were partially offset by:  (i) a   $201.6 million   decrease in cash paid for property acquisitions due to the acquisition of eight wholly-owned properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as compared to the acquisition of three in-process development properties and one wholly-owned operating property during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ; (ii) a   $41.0 million   decrease in cash paid to acquire undeveloped land parcels; (iii) a   $24.7 million   decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures at our wholly-owned and on-campus participating properties; (iv) a   $5.1 million   decrease in cash used during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to escrow deposits made on future acquisition opportunities; (v) a   $1.9 million   decrease in purchases of corporate furniture, fixtures and equipment; and (vi) a   $1.7 million   decrease in cash used to increase ownership in a consolidated subsidiary during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Financing Activities:   Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   $138.6 million   as compared to   $28.1 million   in cash used by financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   $166.7 million   increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the following: (i) a   $556.9 million   increase in net proceeds from the sale of common stock, related to our equity offering in February 2016 and the issuance of common stock under our ATM Equity Program; (ii) a   $193.6 million   decrease in net pay downs on our revolving credit facility;  (iii) a   $92.2 million   decrease in cash used to pay off mortgage debt during the comparable nine month periods; and (iv) a   $2.0 million   decrease in payments of debt issuance costs.  These increases were partially offset by the following: (i)   $399.2 million   provided by the issuance of unsecured notes in September 2015; (ii)   $250.0 million   related to the payoff of our Term Loan II Facility in February 2016; and (iii) a   $29.5 million   increase in distributions to common and restricted stockholders.  
    
  Liquidity Needs, Sources and Uses of Capital 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our short-term liquidity needs included, but were not limited to, the following: (i) anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately $222.8 million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of $1.68 per share and based on the number of our shares outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ; (ii) anticipated distribution payments to our Operating Partnership unitholders totaling approximately $2.1 million based on an assumed annual distribution of $1.68 per common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of 5.99% on our Preferred OP Units based on the number of units outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ; (iii) the payoff of approximately $118.8 million of outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt scheduled to mature during the next 12 months; (iv) the payoff of $197.7 million of mortgage loans related to the anticipated sale of our property portfolio classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016  , which includes $66.2 million of fixed rate date at three held for sale properties already scheduled to mature during the next 12 months, included in item (iii) above; (v) the payoff of our $200.0 million unsecured term loan maturing in January 2017; (vi) estimated development costs over the next 12 months totaling approximately $407.8 million for our wholly-owned properties currently under construction; (vii) funds for other development projects scheduled to commence construction during the next 12 months; and (viii) potential future property or land acquisitions, including mezzanine financed developments.  
    
  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements by (i) borrowing under our existing unsecured credit facility; (ii) accessing the unsecured bond market; (iii) exercising debt extension options to the extent they are available; (iv) issuing securities, including common stock, under our ATM Equity Program discussed more fully in Note   8   in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1; (v) potentially disposing of properties depending on market conditions; and (vi) utilizing current cash on hand and net cash provided by operations. 
    
  In February 2016, Standard   Poor's Rating Services upgraded its corporate credit rating on the Company from BBB- to BBB and in May 2016 Moody's Investors Service upgraded its corporate credit rating on the Company from Baa3 to Baa2.  As a result of the credit rating upgrades, the spread on our unsecured credit facility decreased between 25 and 30 basis points. In addition, the facility fee on our $500 million revolving credit facility decreased by five basis points.   
    
  We may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls. We also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise. Future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing, including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity  
  
   43 

securities. These funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors, including future market conditions, our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets, our future creditworthiness, and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders, including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes. These financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders. 
    
   Distributions 
    
  We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. We may use borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund distributions.  The Board of Directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels, including market factors and our Company s performance in addition to REIT requirements. 
    
  On   November 2, 2016  , we declared a distribution per share of   $0.42  , which will be paid on   November 28, 2016   to all common stockholders of record as of   November 14, 2016  .  At the same time, the Operating Partnership will pay an equivalent amount per unit to holders of Common OP Units, as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of Preferred OP Units. 
    
  Pre-Development Expenditures 
    
  Our third-party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre-development expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits.  The closing and/or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning, land use, building, and other required governmental permits and authorizations  As such, we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities.  We frequently incur these pre-development expenditures before a financing commitment and/or required permits and authorizations have been obtained.  Accordingly, we bear the risk of the loss of these pre-development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations.  Historically, our third-party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed; however, these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled, causing revenue to be recognized in later periods.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have deferred approximately   $9.0 million   in pre-development costs related to third-party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction. 

44 

Indebtedness 
    
  The amounts below exclude net unamortized debt premiums and discounts related to mortgage loans assumed in connection with property acquisitions, original issue discounts, and deferred financing costs (see Note   7   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 for details).  A summary of our consolidated indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

(1)   
    In connection with the issuance of these unsecured notes, the Company terminated two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $200 million, resulting in payments to both counterparties, which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes. When including the effect of these interest rate swap terminations, the weighted average effective rate on the unsecured notes is 4.27%. 

Funds From Operations ( FFO ) 
    
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) currently defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), excluding gains or losses from depreciable operating property sales, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.  FFO excludes GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time.  Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.  We therefore believe that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, among other items, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
    
  We also believe it is meaningful to present a measure we refer to as FFO-Modified, or FFOM, which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our on-campus participating properties and other nonrecurring items.  Under our participating ground leases, we and the participating university systems each receive 50% of the properties  net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service (which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal) and capital expenditures.  A substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required  
  
   45 

to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness. These amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness.  Therefore, unlike the ownership of our wholly-owned properties, the unique features of our ownership interest in our on-campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time.   For example, since the ground/facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt, such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor. Accordingly, we believe it is meaningful to modify FFO to exclude the operations of our on-campus participating properties and to consider their impact on our performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive, both of which increase and decrease with the operating performance of the properties.  This narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our third-party services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization. We believe, however, that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long-term profitability from its investment. When calculating FFOM, we also exclude losses from early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with property dispositions, property acquisition costs and other non-cash items, as we determine in good faith. 
    
  Our FFOM may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on-campus participating properties, which is unique to us and is different from that of our owned off-campus properties.  Companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures; and therefore those companies may not calculate FFOM in the same manner that we do, or at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP and FFO results and using FFOM only supplementally.  Further, FFO and FFOM do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties.  FFO and FFOM should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our liquidity, nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. 

46 

The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO and FFOM: 

(1)   
    50% of the properties  net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service (including repayment of principal) and capital expenditures.  Represents amounts accrued for the interim periods, which is included in ground/facility leases expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
               (2)   
    Represents losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans for four properties sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Such costs are excluded from gains from disposition of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP.  However, we view the losses from early extinguishment of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions.  We believe that adjusting FFOM to exclude these losses more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our disposition transactions. 

Inflation 
    
  Our student leases do not typically provide for rent escalations. However, they typically do not have terms that extend beyond 12 months. Accordingly, although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation, we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs. However, a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates. 

47 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.   Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates.  Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements.  The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates.  Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our revolving credit facilities and variable rate construction loans and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows.   No material changes have occurred in relation to market risk since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31.1 
    
  American Campus Communities, Inc. 
  Certification Of Chief Executive Officer 
  Pursuant To Section 302 Of The Sarbanes Oxley Act Of 2002 
    
  I, William C. Bayless, Jr., certify that: 
    
  1.     I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of American Campus Communities, Inc.; 
    
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d.
