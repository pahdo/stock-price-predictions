1. 
    The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
     Organization and Business 
  Vocera Communications, Inc. (the  Company  or "Vocera") is a provider of secure, integrated, intelligent communication solutions, focused on empowering mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, energy, and other mission-critical mobile work environments, in the United States and internationally. The significant majority of the Company's business is currently generated from sales of its solutions in the healthcare market to help its customers improve patient safety and experience and increase operational efficiency.  
  The Vocera Communication System, which includes an intelligent enterprise software platform, a lightweight, wearable, voice-controlled communication badge, and smartphone applications, enables users to connect instantly with other staff simply by saying the name, function or group name of the desired recipient. It also securely delivers text messages and alerts directly to and from smartphones, replacing legacy pagers.  Other software applications help improve care coordination, patient safety, and patient satisfaction.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and include the accounts of Vocera and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from the Company's audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s interim consolidated financial information. The results for the quarter presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other interim period or any other future year.  
  The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent in all material respects with those presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. The estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, excess and obsolete inventory charges, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation expense, provisions for income taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material to the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
  Revenue Recognition  
  The Company derives revenue from the sales of communication badges, perpetual software licenses for software that is essential to the functionality of the communication badges, smartphones, software maintenance, extended product warranty and professional services. The Company also derives revenue from the sale of licenses for software that is not essential to the functionality of the communication badges and certain hosted software subscriptions. The Company's revenue recognition policy has not changed from that described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Transfer of sales-type leases to third-parties 
  Proceeds from transfers of sales-type leases to third-party financial companies are allocated between the net investment in sales-type leases and the executory cost component for remaining service obligations based on relative present value. The difference between the amount of proceeds allocated to the net investment in lease and the carrying value of the net investment in lease is included in product revenue. Proceeds allocated to the executory cost component are accounted for as financing liabilities.

     Table of Contents  

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company transferred   $3.3 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively,  of lease receivables in non-recourse sales to third-party financial companies, with immaterial net gains (losses). For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded   $1.5 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, of financing liabilities for future performance of executory service obligations. For lease receivables retained as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company recorded   $1.2 million   and   $1.5 million   of net investment in sales-type leases, respectively, equivalent to the minimum lease payments less the unearned interest portion. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) together with the International Accounting Standards Board issued converged guidance for revenue recognition that will replace most existing guidance, eliminate industry-specific guidance and provide a unified model for determining how and when revenue from contracts with customers should be recognized. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard will also introduce additional disclosures, changes in asset and liability accounting, and changes in gain/loss recognition for asset transfers unrelated to customer transactions. 
  In July 2015 the FASB affirmed a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue standard.  The Company s effective date for this standard will be the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Two methods of transition are provided: a full retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients allowed, and a cumulative effect method, with balance sheet adjustment as of January 1, 2018.  The Company is evaluating the effect the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the future effect of the standard on its financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB amended lease accounting requirements to begin recording assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. The new guidance will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. This new guidance will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the future effect of the standard on its financial position or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for stock-based payment award transactions. The guidance is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and the related     disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for credit losses on instruments for both financial services and non-financial services entities. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

2. 
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     The Company s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are carried at their fair values with any differences from their amortized cost recorded in equity as unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities. As a basis for determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company follows a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there have been   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value instruments and   no   transfers in or out of Level 3. 
  The Company's money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company's Level 2 fixed income securities are obtained from independent pricing services,  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model-driven valuations using observable market data or other inputs corroborated by observable market data. The Company does not have any financial instruments which are valued using Level 3 inputs. 
  The Company s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

The Company had no liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   
     The following tables present current and prior-year-end balances for cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

The Company has determined that the unrealized losses on its short-term investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   do not constitute an "other than temporary impairment." The unrealized losses for the short-term investments have all been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. The Company s conclusion of no  other than temporary impairment  is based on the high credit quality of the securities, their short remaining maturity and the Company s intent and ability to hold such loss securities until maturity. 
  Classification of the cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments by contractual maturity was as follows:

5. 
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
     Goodwill 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $10.0 million   and   $10.0 million   of goodwill, respectively, allocated to the Company's Product operating segment.   As of September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of goodwill or acquired intangibles may not be recoverable.  
  Intangible Assets  
  Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortized either straight-line, or over the life of the assets on a basis that resembles the economic benefit of the assets. This yields amortization in the latter case that is higher in earlier periods of the useful life.  
  The estimated useful lives and carrying value of acquired intangible assets are as follows: 

Amortization expense was   $0.2 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   Amortization expense was   $0.6 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

Amortization of acquired intangible assets is reflected in the cost of revenue or operating expenses, depending on the nature of the intangible asset. The estimated future amortization of existing acquired intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016   was as follows:

    Balance Sheet Components  
     Inventories   

  Property and equipment, net   

  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $0.6 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was   $1.7 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Net investment in sales-type leases 
  The Company has sales-type leases with terms of   0.75   to   4   years. Sales-type lease receivables are collateralized by the underlying equipment. The components of our net investment in sales-type leases are as follows: 

There were no allowances for doubtful accounts on these leases as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . There is no guaranteed or unguaranteed residual value on the leased equipment. The current and non-current net investments in sales-type leases are reported as components of the consolidated balance sheet captions "other receivables" and "other long-term assets," respectively. 
  The minimum payments expected to be received for future years under sales-type leases as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Non-cancelable Material Commitments 
  The Company is required to purchase unused, non-cancelable, non-returnable raw material inventory that was purchased by its contract manufacturers based on committed finished goods orders from the Company, certain long lead-time raw materials based on the Company s forecast and current work-in-progress materials. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $6.5 million   and   $7.8 million  , respectively, of such inventory was purchased and held by the third-party manufacturers which was subject to these purchase guarantees. 
  Leases  
  The Company leases office space for its headquarters and subsidiaries under non-cancelable operating leases, which will expire between December 2016 and March 2022. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Facilities rent expense was   $0.6 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Facilities rent expense was   $1.8 million   and   $1.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  Future minimum lease payments at   September 30, 2016   under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 

Indemnifications  
  The Company undertakes, in the ordinary course of business, to (i) defend customers and other parties from certain third-party claims associated with allegations of trade secret misappropriation, infringement of copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights, tortious damage to persons or property or breaches of certain Company obligations relating to confidentiality (e.g., safeguarding protected health information) and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless such parties from certain resulting damages, costs and other liabilities. The term of these undertakings may be perpetual and the maximum potential liability of the Company under  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

certain of these undertakings is not determinable. Based on its historical experience, the Company believes the liability associated with these undertakings is minimal. 
  The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual. The Company currently has directors and officers insurance. As there has been no significant history of losses, no expense accrual has been made. 
  Securities Litigation     
  On August 1 and 21, 2013, two putative securities class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California  against the Company and certain of its officers, its board of directors, a former director and the underwriters for the Company's initial public offering.  On November 20, 2013, the court consolidated the actions as In re Vocera Communications, Inc. Securities Litigation and appointed Lead Plaintiffs.  Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on September 19, 2014.   The consolidated complaint named certain current and former officers and directors and the underwriters for the Company's initial public offering and secondary offering and alleges claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements and omissions in the registration statement for the Company's initial public offering and secondary offering and in communications regarding its business and financial results. The suit was purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between March 28, 2012 and May 2, 2013, and sought compensatory damages, rescission, fees and costs, as well as other relief.  On November 3, 2014 Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.  On February 11, 2015, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Act claims, but denied the motion as to the Exchange Act claims, allowing the matter to proceed on that basis.  On April 27, 2015 Defendants filed answers to the consolidated complaint. 
  A mediation in October 2015 resulted in an agreement in principle to settle the suit.  On March 4, 2016, the Court issued an order granting Lead Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement.  The settlement, which called for payment of   $9 million  , was funded entirely and directly by the Company's insurance carriers and paid during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
  From time to time, the Company may be involved in other lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business.  The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims. Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses from existing matters that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.

    Stock-based Compensation and Awards 
     Stock Option Activity  
  A summary of the stock option activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is presented below:

These discussions contain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to safe harbors under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, expectations regarding demand and acceptance for our technologies, growth opportunities and trends in the market in which we operate, prospects and plans and objectives of management.

We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  
  Business Overview   
  We are a provider of secure, integrated, intelligent communication solutions, focused on empowering mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, energy, and other mission-critical mobile work environments, in the United States and internationally. Today, the significant majority of our business is generated from sales of our solutions in the healthcare market to help our customers improve patient safety and experience and increase operational efficiency.  
  We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products. Our outsourced manufacturing model allows us to scale our business without the significant capital investment and on-going expenses required to establish and maintain manufacturing operations. We work closely with our contract manufacturer, SMTC Corporation, and key suppliers to manage the procurement, quality and cost of components. We seek to maintain an optimal level of finished goods inventory to meet our forecast sales and unanticipated shifts in sales volume and mix. 
  We primarily sell products, software maintenance and professional services directly to end users.  Total revenue increased   21.1%   from   $75.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $91.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net loss of   $7.5 million   compared to a net loss of   $14.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Our diverse customer base ranges from large hospital systems to small local hospitals, as well as other healthcare facilities and customers in non-healthcare markets. We do not rely on any one customer for a substantial portion of our revenue.  While we have international customers in other English speaking countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore and parts of the Middle East, most of our customers are located in the United States.  International customers represented   8.9%  , 8.8% and

9.9% of our revenue in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and the years ended   December 31, 2015   and 2014, respectively. We are exploring plans to expand our presence in other English-speaking markets and enter non-English speaking markets. 
  In recent years, U.S. hospital spending on information technology has been predominantly directed toward further investment in electronic health records and preparation for utilizing new ICD-10 diagnosis coding, which are both driven by regulatory requirements and reimbursement earn-back incentives from federal healthcare reform.  In addition, as patient volumes and reimbursement levels continued to fluctuate for many healthcare providers, hospitals exercised strong expense limits and reductions, also impacting capital purchases and departmental operating budgets through which our solutions are purchased.  Despite this volatility, healthcare providers are placing increased emphasis on and investment in solutions for communication and care coordination, a trend that we believe is favorable for Vocera. 
  We believe certain international markets represent attractive opportunities for growth.  We currently sell our solutions in Canada, the United Kingdom as well as in multiple English speaking countries in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions where we see significant investment in healthcare systems to improve capacity and quality. 
  On October 27, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Extension Healthcare for   $52.5 million   in cash. In addition,   $2.5 million   has been set aside for retention bonuses for key employees to be paid over the next two years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $121.6 million   and   no   outstanding borrowings, which was largely attributable to the net proceeds of two common stock offerings in 2012. In October 2016, we purchased Extension Healthcare for $55 million in an all cash transaction.  This includes $2.5 million which has been set aside for retention bonuses for key employees to be paid over two years.  We also expect to incur approximately $3.5 million to $4.0 million for transaction related expenses.  We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

Operating activities

With respect to changes in assets and liabilities, we experienced a decrease in accounts receivable of   $4.8 million  , which was attributable to collections on prior periods' invoices exceeding the current period billings, an increase of   $0.2 million   in accrued payroll and other liabilities and a   $2.2 million   increase in deferred revenue. These factors were offset by certain cash outflows, including an increase of   $1.5 million   in inventories, an increase of   $0.7 million   in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease of   $0.4 million   in accounts payable.

           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
     
   24 

     Table of Contents  

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, historically we have invested in money market funds.  With the proceeds from our two public offerings in 2012, we have invested in a broader portfolio of high credit quality short-term securities. To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we maintain an average portfolio duration of one year or less. 
  Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income and expense sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the United States. However, because of the short-term nature of our interest-bearing securities, a 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
  Historically our operations have consisted of research and development and sales activities in the United States. As a result, our financial results have not been materially affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets. We are developing plans to expand our international presence. Accordingly, we expect that our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions may increase in future periods. 
   
  Item 4.        Controls and Procedures   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation under the supervision of, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings  
     From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business.  
  Securities Litigation  
  On August 1 and 21, 2013, two putative securities class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our officers, our board of directors, a former director and the underwriters for the initial public offering.  On November 20, 2013, the court consolidated the actions as   In re Vocera Communications, Inc. Securities Litigation   and appointed Lead Plaintiffs.  Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on September 19, 2014.   The consolidated complaint named certain current and former officers and directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering and secondary offering and alleges claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements and omissions in the registration statement for our initial public offering and secondary offering and in communications regarding its business and financial results. The suit was purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our securities between March 28, 2012 and May 2, 2013, and sought compensatory damages, rescission, fees and costs, as well as other relief.  On November 3, 2014, Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.  On February 11, 2015, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Act claims, but denied the motion as to the Exchange Act claims, allowing the matter to proceed on that basis.  On April 27, 2015, Defendants filed answers to the consolidated complaint. 
  A mediation in October 2015 resulted in an agreement in principle to settle the suit.  On March 4, 2016, the Court issued an order granting  Lead Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement.  The settlement, which called for payment of $9 million, was funded entirely and directly by our insurance carriers and paid during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
            Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors  
     Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed if any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, actually occur. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. 
  Risks related to our business and industry 
  We have incurred significant losses in the past, and will likely experience losses in the future. 
  We have incurred significant losses in the past and reported a net loss of   $7.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an accumulated deficit of   $117.3 million  . If we cannot make consistent progress toward future profitability, our business and our stock price may be adversely affected. 
  Our ability to be profitable in the future depends upon continued demand for our communication solutions from existing and new customers. Further market adoption of our solutions, including increased penetration within our existing customers, depends upon our ability to improve patient safety and satisfaction and increase hospital efficiency and productivity, and to bring value to customers outside of healthcare. Additionally, further adoption of our solutions in non-healthcare markets depends on our ability to modify our products to successfully respond to the challenges in those markets and our sales efforts to reach the customers in those markets. In addition, our profitability will be affected by, among other things, our ability to execute on our business strategy, the timing and size of orders, the pricing and costs of our solutions, macroeconomic conditions affecting the health care industry and the extent to which we invest in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative resources. 
  We depend on sales of our Vocera Communication solution in the healthcare market for substantially all of our revenue, and a decrease in sales in the healthcare market would harm our business. 
  To date, substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales of our Vocera Communication solution to the healthcare market and, in particular, hospitals. Sales of our Vocera Communication solution to the healthcare market accounted for 94%, 93% and 92% of our revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that sales of our Vocera Communication solution will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.   
  While we are seeking to increase sales of our Vocera Communications solution to non-healthcare customers, we do not anticipate that sales of our Vocera Communication solution in non-healthcare markets will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.

Our success depends in part upon the deployment of our Vocera Communication solution by new hospital customers, the expansion and upgrade of our solution at existing customers, and our ability to continue to provide on a timely basis cost-effective solutions that meet the requirements of our hospital customers. Our Vocera Communication solution requires a substantial upfront investment by customers. Typically, our hospital customers initially deploy our solution for specific users in specific departments before expanding our solution into other departments or for other users. The cost of the initial deployment depends on the number of users and departments involved, the size and age of the hospital and the condition of the existing wireless infrastructure, if any, within the hospital. 
    
  Even if hospital personnel determine that our Vocera Communication solution provides compelling benefits over their existing communications methods, their hospitals may not have, or may not be willing to spend, the resources necessary to install and maintain wireless infrastructure to initially deploy and support our solution or expand our solution to other departments or users. Hospitals are currently facing significant budget constraints from unpredictable patient population trends and commercial reimbursements, and increasing demands from, and competition for, patients. In addition, both governmental and commercial hospitals are experiencing lower Medicare reimbursement rates and higher compliance demands, and penalties from the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) and other healthcare reform legislation. As a consequence, we may experience slowdowns and deferral of orders for our solution that could negatively impact our sales. We might not be able to sustain or increase our revenue from sales of our Vocera Communication solution, or achieve the growth rates that we envision, if hospitals continue to face significant budgetary constraints and reduce their spending on communications systems. 
    
  If we fail to offer high-quality services and support for any of our solutions, our operating results and our ability to sell those solutions in the future will be harmed. 
    
  Our ability to sell our Vocera Communication or Care Experience solutions is dependent upon our professional services and technical support teams providing high-quality services and support. Our professional services team assists our customers with their wireless infrastructure assessment, clinical workflow design, communication solution configuration, training and project management during the pre-deployment and deployment stages. Once our solutions are deployed within a customer s facility, the customer typically depends on our technical support team to help resolve technical issues, assist in optimizing the use of our solutions and facilitate adoption of new functionality. If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical and other post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support services, our ability to expand the use of our solutions with existing customers and to sell our solutions to new customers will be harmed. If deployment of our solutions is deemed unsatisfactory, we may incur significant costs to attain and sustain customer satisfaction or, in extreme cases, our customers may choose not to deploy our solution. As we rapidly hire new services and support personnel, we may inadvertently hire underperforming people who will have to be replaced, or fail to effectively train such employees, leading in some instances to slower growth, additional costs and poor customer relations. In addition, the failure of channel partners to provide high-quality services and support in markets outside the United States could also harm sales of our solutions. 
    
  As we continue to pursue opportunities for larger deals that have greater technical complexity, we may experience a longer time period for the deals to deploy and as a result, our revenue recognition for these deals may be delayed.  Additionally, as we enter agreements with new and existing customers for larger and more complex deals across multiple sites, we have been and may continue to be required to agree to customer acceptance clauses.  Delays may occur in obtaining customer acceptance regardless of the quality of our products and services, and may cause us to defer revenue recognition where such acceptance provisions are substantive in nature, or they may require us to incur additional professional services or other costs in an effort to obtain such customer acceptance. 
    
  Our sales cycle can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly. 
    
  Our sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our solutions, including the technical capabilities of our solutions and the potential cost savings and productivity gains achievable by deploying them. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our solutions but also their existing communications methods and those of our competitors, and can result in a lengthy sales cycle of nine to twelve months or more. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce sales.   In addition, purchases of our solutions are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. For example, we experienced elongated sales cycles due to uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform and lower hospital admission trends in 2013 and 2014.  Hospitals in the U.S. continue to face significant uncertainty over the continuing impact of federal government budgets, and continuing changes in the implementation

and deadlines for compliance with the ACA and other healthcare reform legislation, as well as potential future statutes and rulemaking. 
    
  Our business has gone through cycles of expansion, relative stability and contraction, and if we are not able to manage such cycles effectively, our operating results may suffer. 
    
  We have experienced periods of expansion, relative stability and contraction in our revenues and operations in the past. Such fluctuation has placed, and may continue to place, strains on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Especially during growth periods, we hire additional direct sales, professional services and marketing personnel domestically and internationally, acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets, and increase our investment in research and development. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully implement such plans and manage such investments. To do so successfully we must, among other things: 
             
    manage our expenses in line with our operating plans and current business environment; 
                
    maintain and enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; 
                
    integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets; 
                
    manage operations in multiple locations and time zones; and 
                
    develop and deliver new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions efficiently and reliably. 
       
  We expect to incur costs associated with the investments made to support our business strategy before the anticipated benefits or the returns are realized, if at all. If we are unable to grow our business or manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions. We may also fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in lower revenue and a decline in the share price of our common stock. 
    
  Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to fluctuate, making our quarterly results difficult to predict, which may cause us to miss analyst expectations and may result in the price of our common stock to decline. 
    
  Our operating results have been and may continue to be difficult to predict, even in the near term, and are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. 
    
  Comparisons of our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Each of the following factors, among others, could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter: 
             
    the financial health of our healthcare customers and budgetary constraints on their ability to upgrade their communications; 
                
    changes in the regulatory environment affecting our healthcare customers, including impediments to their ability to obtain reimbursement for their services; 
                
    our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations; 
                
    our ability to successfully integrate acquired business; 
                
    the announcement of new significant contracts or relationships; 
                
    the procurement and deployment cycles of our healthcare customers and the length of our sales cycles; 
                
    changes in customer deployment timelines; 
                
    variations in the amount of orders booked in a prior quarter but not delivered until later quarters; 
                
    our mix of solutions and pricing, including discounts by us or our competitors; 
                
    our ability to expand into non-healthcare markets; 
                
    our ability to develop significant new reseller relationships and maintain existing reseller relationships; 
                
    our ability to successfully deploy our solutions; 
                
    our ability to forecast demand and manage lead times for the manufacture of our solutions; and 
                
    our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions that achieve market acceptance. 
       
  If we do not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits from our acquisitions or if we cannot successfully integrate them, our business and operating results could be harmed. 
    
  We have acquired, and in the future may acquire, complementary businesses, technologies or assets that we believe to be strategic, such as our acquisitions of mVisum in the first quarter of 2014, Prana Technologies in the third quarter of 2014 and Extension Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2016. We may not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits, or be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, technologies or assets. If we cannot effectively integrate the acquired business and products into our business, we may not achieve market acceptance for, or significant revenue from, these new solutions. 

28 

     Table of Contents  

Integrating newly acquired businesses, technologies and assets could strain our resources, could be expensive and time consuming, and might not be successful. Our recent acquisitions expose us, and we will be further exposed, if we acquire or invest in additional businesses, technologies or assets, to a number of risks, including that we may: 
             
    experience technical issues as we integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets into our existing communications solutions; 
                
    encounter difficulties leveraging our existing sales and marketing organizations, and direct sales channels, to increase our revenue from acquired businesses, technologies or assets; 
                
    find that the acquisition does not further our business strategy, we overpaid for the acquisition or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed; 
                
    have difficulty retaining the key personnel of acquired businesses; 
                
    incur substantial costs to integrate the acquired business; 
                
    suffer disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management's attention as a result of transition or integration issues and the challenges of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; and 
                
    experience unforeseen and significant problems or liabilities associated with quality, technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquisition, such as intellectual property or employment matters. 
                
    incur substantial costs to integrate the acquired business 
       
  We completed the acquisition of Extension Healthcare, which is a significantly larger acquisition than any that we have completed to date, and each of the factors identified above present challenges to our achieving the success that we anticipate from this acquisition. 
    
  In addition, from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs. We used a significant portion of our available cash for our recent purchase of Extension Healthcare for $55 million and we expect to incur approximately $3.5 million to $4.0 million for transaction related expenses.  If we were to proceed with one or more additional significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options and warrants, the ownership of existing stockholders would be diluted. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, large write-offs, or other unanticipated costs, events or circumstances, any of which could harm our operating results. 
    
  Developments in the healthcare industry and governing regulations have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business. 
    
  Substantially all of our revenue is derived from customers in the healthcare industry, in particular, hospitals. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Developments generally affecting the healthcare industry, including new regulations or new interpretations of existing regulations, could adversely affect spending on information technology and capital equipment by reducing funding, changing healthcare pricing or delivery or creating impediments for obtaining healthcare reimbursements, which together with declining admission trends, could cause our sales to decline and negatively impact our business. For example, the profit margins of our hospital customers are modest, and pending changes in reimbursement for healthcare costs may reduce the overall solvency of our customers or cause further deterioration in their financial or business condition. 
    
  Since 2009, three significant bills were signed into law that impact the U.S. healthcare system.  Those bills include The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted under Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (HITECH Act), the ACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Together, these acts drive substantive changes over several years to the operating processes, reimbursements and rules governing the U.S. healthcare system. The actual end effect of these laws on the marketplace is not yet fully understood. 
    
  We believe that our healthcare customers are unsure of the impact that a number of the elements of those acts will have on their business, and cannot predict the timing and requirements of the final rules issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for these statutes, making managing their business operations more difficult.  Further, as has been experienced since 2010, as rules and agency guidance pursuant to these statutes are implemented and revised by HHS, a number of aspects of the acts have been interpreted, modified or delayed. For example, sudden changes in the rules for individuals buying insurance through state or federal health insurance exchanges, and individual and employer mandates to have and offer insurance coverage, have challenged hospitals  abilities to forecast patient utilization and revenues, and to set operational plans and budget accordingly. 
    
  Federal budget activities also impact our customers. We believe that it is likely that additional legislative changes by Congress and rulemaking by HHS will continue. Our customers include healthcare facilities run by the Department of Defense and the U.S.  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

Department of Veterans Affairs.  These potential customers have been and may continue to be impacted by budgetary and legislative actions. 
    
  In addition, many state governments are changing or expanding their healthcare laws, adding additional complexity to understanding the potential impacts. 
    
  We are unable to predict the full impact of these new and changing rules on our hospital customers and others in the healthcare industry.  Impacts of these rules have affected and could continue to affect materially our customers  ability to budget for or purchase our products. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. We cannot provide assurance that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets. 
    
  We primarily compete in the rapidly evolving and competitive healthcare market, and if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, our business and operating results could be harmed. 
    
  We believe that the primary competition for our Vocera Communication solution has consisted of traditional methods using wired and wireless phones, pagers and overhead intercoms. While we believe that our system is superior to these legacy methods, our solution requires a significant infrastructure investment by a hospital and many hospitals' spending is severely constrained by other priorities. 
    
  Manufacturers and distributors of product categories such as cellular phones, smartphone applications, pagers, mobile radios and in-building wireless telephones also sell their products to hospitals as components of communication solutions. Of these product categories, in-building wireless telephones and pagers represent the most significant current competition for the sale of our solution. The market for in-building wireless phones is dominated by communications companies such as Cisco Systems, Ascom and Spectralink. In addition, the growing proliferation of smartphones and related applications, including cloud-based applications,  represents another category of competitive offerings. While we consider secure text-messaging using smartphones a feature valued by many customers, we do not believe most of our potential customers would consider that feature alone an adequate substitute for a comprehensive multi-mode communication solution. Some customers may choose solutions that are not HIPAA-compliant, given their budget constraints. 
    
  While we do not currently have a directly comparable single competitor that provides a solution as richly-featured as the Vocera Communication system for the healthcare market, we could face such competition in the future. Potential competitors in the healthcare or communications markets include large, multinational companies with significantly more resources to dedicate to product development and sales and marketing. These companies may have existing relationships within the hospital, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. Customers may prefer to purchase a more highly integrated or bundled solution from a single provider or an existing supplier rather than a new supplier, regardless of performance or features. Accordingly, if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, we could experience pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, higher sales and marketing expenses, lower revenue and the loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition. 
    
  If we fail to increase market awareness of our brand and solutions, and expand our sales and marketing operations, our business could be harmed. 
    
  We intend to continue to add personnel and resources in sales and marketing as we focus on expanding awareness of our brand and solutions and capitalize on sales opportunities with new and existing customers. Our efforts to improve sales of our solutions will result in an increase in our sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense, and these efforts may not be successful. Some newly hired sales and marketing personnel may subsequently be determined to be unproductive and have to be replaced, resulting in operational and sales delays and incremental costs. If we are unable to significantly increase the awareness of our brand and solutions or effectively manage the costs associated with these efforts, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. 
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

We depend on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers, and if we are unable to source our components from them, our business and operating results could be harmed. 
    
  We depend on sole and limited source suppliers for several hardware components of our Vocera Communication solution, including our batteries and integrated circuits. We purchase inventory generally through individual purchase orders. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. These suppliers typically rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers, and as a result, even if available, the supplier may not be able to secure sufficient materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our components in a timely manner. Any of these circumstances could cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of our solutions to our customers, and this may force us to seek components from alternative sources, which may not have the required specifications, or be available in time to meet demand or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any of these circumstances may also force us to redesign our solutions if a component becomes unavailable in order to incorporate a component from an alternative source. 
    
  Our solutions incorporate multiple software components obtained from licensors on a non-exclusive basis, such as voice recognition software, software supporting the runtime execution of our software platform, and database and reporting software. Our license agreements can be terminated for cause. In many cases, these license agreements specify a limited term and are only renewable beyond that term with the consent of the licensor. If a licensor terminates a license agreement for cause, objects to its renewal or conditions renewal on modified terms and conditions, we may be unable to obtain licenses for equivalent software components on reasonable terms and conditions, including licensing fees, warranties or protection from infringement claims. Some licensors may discontinue licensing their software to us or support of the software version used in our solutions. In such circumstances, we may need to redesign our solutions at substantial cost to incorporate alternative software components or be subject to higher royalty costs. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect the cost and availability of our solutions. 
    
  Third-party licensors generally require us to incorporate specific license terms and conditions in our agreements with our customers. If we are alleged to have failed to incorporate these license terms and conditions, we may be subject to claims by these licensors, incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such claims and, if such claims are successful, be subject to termination of licenses, monetary damages, or an injunction against the continued distribution of one or more of our solutions. 
    
  Because we depend upon a contract manufacturer and original design manufacturers, our operations could be harmed and we could lose sales if we encounter problems with these manufacturers. 
    
  We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a contract manufacturer, SMTC, to produce the primary hardware component of our Vocera Communication solution. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with SMTC that is terminable by either party with advance notice and that may also be terminated for a material uncured breach. We also rely on original design manufacturers, or ODMs, to produce accessories, including batteries, chargers and attachments. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. If SMTC or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions in the volumes that we require, fails to meet our quality specifications or significantly increases its prices, we may not be able to deliver our solutions to our customers with the quantities, quality and performance that they expect in a timely manner. As a result, we could lose sales and our operating results could be harmed. 
  SMTC or ODMs may experience problems that could impact the quantity and quality of components of our Vocera Communication solution, including disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, component or material shortages and cost increases. SMTC and these ODMs generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers, and as a result, may not be able to secure sufficient components or other materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build components of our solutions in a timely manner. The majority of the components of our Vocera Communication solution are manufactured in Asia or Mexico and adverse changes in political or economic circumstances in those locations could also disrupt our supply and quality of components of our solutions. 
    
  Companies occasionally encounter unexpected difficulties in ramping up production of new products, and we may experience such difficulties with future generations of our products. SMTC and our ODMs also manufacture products for other companies. Generally, our orders represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by SMTC and these ODMs from their customers; therefore, fulfilling our orders may not be a priority in the event SMTC or an ODM is constrained in its ability to fulfill  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

all of its customer obligations. In addition, if SMTC or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions, we may have to identify one or more alternative manufacturers. The process of identifying and qualifying a new contract manufacturer or ODM can be time consuming, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, transitioning to a new manufacturer may cause us to incur additional costs and delays if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing components of our solutions to our specifications or quality standards. 
    
  If we fail to forecast our manufacturing requirements accurately, or fail to properly manage our inventory with our contract manufacturer, we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays, which can adversely affect our operating results. 
    
  We place orders with our contract manufacturer, SMTC, and we and SMTC place orders with suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand. Because of our international low cost sourcing strategy, our lead times are long and cause substantially more risk to forecasting accuracy than would result were lead times shorter. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates affecting our ability to meet our customers' demands for our solutions. We also may face additional forecasting challenges due to product transitions in the components of our solutions, or to our suppliers discontinuing production of materials and subcomponents required for our solutions. If demand for our solutions increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to source additional materials and subcomponents to produce components of our solutions or to expedite the manufacture and delivery of additional inventory. If we underestimate customer demand, our contract manufacturer may have inadequate materials and subcomponents on hand to produce components of our solutions, which could result in manufacturing interruptions, shipment delays, deferral or loss of revenue, and damage to our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we and SMTC may purchase more inventory than required for actual customer orders, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory, thereby increasing our costs and harming our operating results. 
    
  If hospitals do not have and are not willing to install, upgrade and maintain the wireless infrastructure required to effectively operate our Vocera Communication solution, then they may experience technical problems or not purchase our solution at all. 
    
  The effectiveness of our Vocera Communication solution depends upon the quality and compatibility of the communications environment that our healthcare customers maintain. Our solutions require voice-grade wireless, or Wi-Fi, installed through large enterprise environments, which can vary from hospital to hospital and from department to department within a hospital. Many hospitals have not installed a voice-grade wireless infrastructure. If potential customers do not have a wireless network that can properly and fully interoperate with our Vocera Communication solution, then such a network must be installed, or an existing Wi-Fi network must be upgraded or modified, for example, by adding access points in stairwells, for our Vocera Communication solution to be fully functional. The additional cost of installing or upgrading a Wi-Fi network may dissuade potential customers from installing our solution. Furthermore, if changes to a customer's physical or information technology environment cause integration issues or degrade the effectiveness of our solution, or if the customer fails to upgrade or maintain its environment as may be required for software releases or updates or to ensure our solution's effectiveness, the customer may not be able to fully utilize our solution or may experience technical problems, or these changes may impact the performance of other wireless equipment being used. If such circumstances arise, prospective customers may not purchase or existing customers may not expand their use of or deploy upgraded versions of our Vocera Communication solution, thereby harming our business and operating results. 
    
  If we fail to achieve and maintain certification for certain U.S. federal standards, our sales to U.S. government customers will suffer. 
    
  We believe that a significant opportunity exists to sell our products to healthcare facilities in the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (DoD).  These customers require independent certification of compliance with specific requirements relating to encryption, security, interoperability and scalability, including Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and, as to DoD, certification by its Joint Interoperability and Test Command and under its Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process. We have received certification under certain of these standards for military-specific configurations of the Vocera communication solution incorporating the B2000 and B3000 badges.  We are continuing to carry out further compliance activities.  A failure on our part to achieve and maintain compliance, both as to current products and as to new product versions, could adversely impact our revenue.

Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
    
  We rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.  If our systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may significantly suffer and we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions or potential liability. Security breaches could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. 
  Our efforts to sell our communications solutions in non-healthcare markets may not be successful. 
  In recent years, we have actively engaged in sales efforts to customers outside the healthcare markets, including hospitality, energy and other mobile work environments. We may not be successful in further penetrating the non-healthcare markets upon which we are initially focusing, or other new markets. To date, our Vocera Communication solution has been selected by over 270 customers in non-healthcare markets. Total revenue from non-healthcare customers accounted for 3%, 2% and 3% of our revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. If we cannot maintain these customers by providing communications solutions that meet their requirements, if we cannot successfully expand our communications solutions in non-healthcare markets, or if adoption of our solutions is slow, we may not obtain significant revenue from these markets. We may experience challenges as we expand in non-healthcare markets, including pricing pressure on our solutions and technical issues as we adapt our solutions for the requirements of new markets. Our communications solutions also may not contain the functionality required by these non-healthcare markets or may not sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions. 
    
  If we fail to successfully develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer. 
    
  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions that meet existing and new customer requirements. We may not be able to develop and introduce new solutions or features on a timely basis or in response to customers  changing requirements, or that sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions. We may experience technical problems and additional costs as we introduce new features to our software platform, deploy future models of our wireless badges, which can require customers to perform software upgrades to their systems, and integrate new solutions with existing customer clinical systems and workflows. In addition, we may face technical difficulties as we expand into non-English speaking countries and incorporate non-English speech recognition capabilities into our Vocera Communication solution. We also may incur substantial costs or delays in the manufacture of any additional new products or models as we seek to optimize production methods and processes at our contract manufacturer. In addition, we expect that we will at least initially achieve lower gross margins on new models, while endeavoring to reduce manufacturing costs over time. If any of these problems were to arise, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer. 
    
  We generally recognize revenue from maintenance and support contracts and subscription arrangements over the contract term, and changes in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. 
  We generally recognize revenue from our customer maintenance and support contracts, extended warranty contracts and subscription arrangements ratably over the contract term, which is typically 12 months, in some cases subject to an early termination right. Revenue from our maintenance and support contracts accounted for   35%  , 37% and 37% of our revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to maintenance and support contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed maintenance and support, extended warranty contracts or subscription agreements by our customers in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market  
  
   33

acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.  
    
  Our success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business. 
    
  Our success depends, in part, on the continuing services of our senior management and other key personnel, and our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, sales and marketing. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the Silicon Valley where our headquarters are located. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, our ability to grow our business could be harmed. 
    
  The members of our senior management and other key personnel are at-will employees, and may terminate their employment at any time without notice. If one or more members of our senior management terminate their employment, we may not be able to find qualified individuals to replace them on a timely basis or at all and our senior management may need to divert their attention from other aspects of our business. Former employees may also become employees of a competitor. We may also have to pay additional compensation to attract and retain key personnel. We also anticipate hiring additional engineering, marketing and sales, and services personnel to grow our business. Often, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train these personnel. We may incur significant costs to attract, integrate and retain them, and we may lose them to a competitor or another company before we realize the benefit of our investments in them. 
    
  Our international operations subject us, and may increasingly subject us in the future, to operational, financial, economic and political risks abroad. 
    
  Although we derive a relatively small portion of our revenue from customers outside the United States, we believe that non-U.S. customers could represent an increasing share of our revenue in the future. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated   8.9%  , 8.8% and 9.9% of our revenue, respectively, from customers outside of the United States, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand. In the second quarter of 2014, we opened a new innovation center in India and a sales office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business solely in the United States, including:  
             
    challenges incorporating non-English speech recognition capabilities into our solutions as we expand into non-English speaking jurisdictions; 
                
    difficulties integrating our solutions with wireless infrastructures with which we do not have experience; 
                
    difficulties integrating local dialing plans and applicable PBX standards; 
                
    challenges associated with delivering support, training and documentation in several languages; 
                
    difficulties in staffing and managing personnel and resellers; 
                
    the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including increasingly stringent data privacy regulations, requirements for export controls for encryption technology, employment laws, changes in tax laws and tax audits by government agencies; 
                
    political and economic instability in, or foreign conflicts that involve or affect, the countries of our customers; 
                
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; 
                
    exposure to competitors who are more familiar with local markets; 
                
    risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; 
                
    difficulties associated with resolving contract disputes in foreign countries with varied legal systems; 
                
    limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in some countries; and  
                
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could affect the price of our solutions relative to locally produced solutions. 
       
  Any of these factors could harm our existing international business, impair our ability to expand into international markets or harm our operating results. 
    
  Our solutions are highly complex and may contain software or hardware defects that could harm our reputation and operating results. 
    
  Our solutions incorporate complex technology, are deployed in a variety of complex hospital environments and must interoperate with many different types of devices and hospital systems. While we test the components of our solutions for defects and errors prior to release, we or our customers may not discover a defect or error until after we have deployed our solution, integrated it into the hospital environment and our customer has commenced general use of the solution. In addition, our solutions in some cases are integrated with hardware and software offered by  middleware  vendors in order to interoperate with nurse call systems,  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

device alarms and other hospital systems. If we cannot successfully integrate our solution with these vendors as needed or if any hardware or software of these vendors contains any defect or error, then our solution may not perform as designed, or may exhibit a defect or error. 
    
  Any defects or errors in, or which are attributed to, our solutions, could result in: 
             
    delayed market acceptance of our affected solutions; 
                
    loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition; 
                
    loss of customers or inability to attract new customers; 
                
    diversion of engineering or other resources for remedying the defect or error; 
                
    damage to our brand and reputation; 
                
    delay in delivery of information; 
                
    increased service and warranty costs, including potential replacement costs for product recalls; and  
                
    legal actions by our customers and hospital patients, including product liability claims. 
       
  If any of these occur, our operating results and reputation could be harmed. 
    
  We face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information collected through our solutions. 
    
  In connection with our healthcare communications business, we handle and have access to personal health information subject in the United States to HIPAA or HITECH, regulations issued pursuant to these statutes, state privacy and security laws and regulations, and associated contractual obligations as a  business associate  of healthcare providers. These statutes, regulations and contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we must comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these statutes, regulations and contractual obligations as we develop our solutions, a failure by us to comply with their requirements (e.g., evolving encryption and security requirements) or an allegation that defects in our products have resulted in noncompliance by our customers could create material civil and/or criminal liability for us, resulting in adverse publicity and negatively affecting our business. 
    
  In addition, the use and disclosure of personal health information is subject to laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we do business or expect to do business in the future. Any developments stemming from enactment or modification of these laws and regulations, or the failure by us to comply with their requirements or to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these laws could create material liability to us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. 
    
  For example, the EU adopted the DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the storage of personally identifiable information on computers or recorded on other electronic media. This has been implemented by all EU member states through national laws. DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states. Similarly, Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act, as well as a variety of provincial statutes, provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. A finding that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. 
    
  Any legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information could affect the way we operate our services and could harm our business. For example, the European Court of Justice recently invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain EU legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. While other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers.  The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our solutions or increase the costs associated with selling our solutions, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop solutions in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Further, we cannot assure you that our privacy and security policies and practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.

The failure of our equipment lease customers to pay us under leasing agreements with them that we do not sell to third party lease finance companies could harm our revenue and operating results. 
    
  In 2012 we began offering our badges and related hardware accessories to our customers through multi-year equipment lease agreements.  In connection with each sale, we recognize product-related revenue at the net present value of the lease payment stream once our obligations related to such sale have been met. We plan to sell the bulk of these leases, including the related accounts receivables, to third party lease finance companies on a non-recourse basis.  We will have to retain unsold leases in-house, which will expose us to the creditworthiness of such equipment lease customers over the lease term.  For the leases that we retain in-house, our ability to collect payments from a customer or to recognize revenue for the sale could be impaired if the customer fails to meet its obligations to us such as in the case of its bankruptcy filing or deterioration in its financial position, or has other creditworthiness issues, any of which could harm our revenue and operating results. 
    
  If our efforts to protect the security of information collected by our customers are unsuccessful, we could become subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer. 
    
  The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers. We have implemented programs to detect and alert us to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Companies are increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to malfeasance by employees, consultants or other service providers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. In recent times, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. If we experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our customers could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our products or purchasing from us altogether. 
    
  Our use of open source and non-commercial software components could impose risks and limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions. 
    
  Our solutions contain software modules licensed under open source and other types of non-commercial licenses, including the GNU Public License, the Apache License and others. We also may incorporate open source and other licensed software into our solutions in the future. Use and distribution of such software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as licenses of these types generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some of these licenses require the release of our proprietary source code to the public if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. This could allow competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately result in a loss of sales for us. 
    
  The terms of many open source and other non-commercial licenses have not been judicially interpreted and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In such event, in order to continue offering our solutions, we could be required to seek licenses from alternative licensors, which may not be available on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event we cannot obtain a license or re-engineer our solutions on a timely basis, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, if an owner of licensed software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the corresponding license agreement, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be required to disclose our source code, or be enjoined from the distribution of our solutions. 
    
  Claims of intellectual property infringement could harm our business. 

36 

     Table of Contents  

Vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies in our industry. Although claims of this kind have not materially affected our business to date, there can be no assurance of the absence of such claims in the future. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could harm our business and operating results. 
    
  Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to many other industry participants, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence. 
    
  Many potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. 
    
  If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights. 
    
  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary technology through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries. We also protect our proprietary technology through licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. These protections may not be available in all cases or may be inadequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or solutions in an unauthorized manner. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, or superior, to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired. 
  To prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than us. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. While we plan to continue to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that: 
             
    current or future U.S. or foreign patent applications will be approved; 
                
    our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties; 
                
    we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we develop technology, or we or our competitors operate; or  
                
    others will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us. 
       
  Our failure to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation of our patents, or our inability to protect any of our intellectual property, may weaken our competitive position and harm our business and operating results. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Product liability or other liability claims could cause us to incur significant costs, adversely affect the sales of our solutions and harm our reputation. 
    
  Our solutions are utilized by healthcare professionals and others in the course of providing patient care. It is possible that patients, family members, physicians, nurses or others may allege we are responsible for harm to patients or healthcare professionals due to defects in, the malfunction of, the characteristics of, or the operation of, our solutions. Any such allegations could harm our reputation and ability to sell our solutions. 
    
  Our solutions utilize lithium-ion batteries and electronic components that may overheat or otherwise malfunction as a result of physical or environmental damage.  Components of our solutions emit radio frequency (RF) emissions which have been alleged, in connection with cellular phones, to have adverse health consequences.  Magnets in our badges may emit electromagnetic radiation and may be alleged to interfere with implanted medical or other devices.  While these components of our solutions comply with applicable guidelines, some may allege that these components of our solutions cause adverse health consequences.  Also, applicable guidelines may change making these components of our solutions non-compliant.  Any such allegations or non-compliance, or any regulatory developments, could negatively impact the sales of our solutions, require costly modifications to our solutions, and harm our reputation. 
    
  Although our customer agreements contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our potential liability, we could be required to spend significant amounts of management time and resources to defend ourselves against product liability, tort, warranty or other claims. If any such claims were to prevail, we could be forced to pay damages, comply with injunctions or stop distributing our solutions. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management's attention away from our business. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions; however, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on acceptable terms. Further, the insurer could attempt to disclaim coverage as to any particular claim. 
    
  Some of our solutions are, and others could become, subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or similar foreign agencies, which could increase our operating costs. 
    
  We provide certain products that are, and others that may become, subject to regulation by the FDA and similar agencies in other countries, or the jurisdiction of these agencies could be expanded in the future to include our solutions. The FDA regulates certain products, including software-based products, as  medical devices  based, in part, on the intended use of the product and the risk the device poses to the patient should the device fail to perform properly. Although we have concluded that our wireless badge is a general-purpose communications device not subject to FDA regulation, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion, or changes in our solutions or the FDA s evolving regulation could lead to FDA regulation of our solutions. Any of our products deemed to be medical devices would be subject to the 2.3% excise tax under the ACA. Canada and many other countries in which we sell or may sell our solutions could also have similar regulations applicable to our solutions, some of which may be subject to change or interpretation. We may incur substantial operating costs if we are required to register our solutions or components of our solutions as regulated medical devices under U.S. or foreign regulations, obtain premarket approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, and satisfy the extensive reporting requirements. In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions and monetary penalties. The clinical alert notification solution we acquired as part of our acquisition of Extension Healthcare and the clinical communications product we acquired from mVisum are regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. 
    
  Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions or terrorism. 
    
  Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and many critical components of our solutions are sourced in Asia and Mexico, regions known to suffer natural disasters. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, occurring at our headquarters, our other facilities or where our contract manufacturer or its suppliers are located, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce located worldwide, and in particular, our senior management, general and administrative, and research and development activities that are coordinated with our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Any disruption to our internal communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Asia or Mexico could delay our research and development efforts, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or delay deployment of our solutions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

We may require additional capital to support our business growth, and such capital may not be available. 
    
  We intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, which include the need to develop new solutions or enhance existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, expand into non-healthcare markets, and acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure funds. Equity and debt financing, however, might not be available when needed or, if available, might not be available on terms satisfactory to us. If we raise additional funds through equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited as we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our initiatives, which could harm our operating results. 
  As an  emerging growth company  under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and may, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and governance requirements. 
    
  As an  emerging growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), we are permitted to, and may, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and governance requirements. For example, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, which can last, at most, until the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, we will not be required to: 
             
    have our independent registered public accounting firm report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act); 
                
    comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
                
    provide the  compensation discussion and analysis  and certain compensation tables for our named executive officers in our Form 10-K or annual proxy statement; and  
                
    submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as  say on pay  and  say on frequency.  
     We will be an emerging growth company until the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. When we cease to be an emerging growth company, as of each fiscal year end, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While management has established plans to accommodate the additional assessment and attestation procedures and related costs of Section 404(b) compliance, we may incur additional costs or require additional management time to comply with Section 404(b) in a timely manner. 
    
  If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. 
    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we must obtain confidence in our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the extent we find a material weakness or other deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. 
  Multiple negative consequences could ensue if a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is identified in the future, or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or we do not maintain effective controls. For example, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could be restated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our controls from our independent registered public accounting firm (once such opinion is required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), or we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. All of these outcomes would require additional financial and management resources, and the market price of our stock could decline. 
    
  We will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance obligations. 
    
  As a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses, even though we as an  emerging growth company  may rely upon the disclosure and governance exemptions under the JOBS Act.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street

Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and our stock exchange, impose various requirements on public companies, including certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations, along with compliance with accounting principles and regulatory interpretations of such principles, as amended by the JOBS Act, have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. 
  We face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards. 
    
  We have in the past been, and may in the future become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. For example, a purported securities class action was filed in August 2013 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our officers and directors. The suit purported to allege claims for allegedly misleading statements regarding our business and financial results. Regardless of the outcome, these matters or future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  The SEC  conflict minerals  rule has caused us to incur additional expenses, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products and could make us less competitive in our target markets. 
  We are required to disclose the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The SEC requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, engage in supply chain due diligence and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report on Form SD covering the prior calendar year. The rule could limit our ability to source at competitive prices and to secure sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, as the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to auditing our compliance with the rules, costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain. 
  Risks related to our common stock 
  The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value. 
  There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described in this  Risk Factors  section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
             
    actual or anticipated variation in anticipated operating results of us or our competitors; 
                
    the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; 
                
    announcements by us or our competitors of new solutions, new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; 
                
    failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; 
                
    developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; 
                
    commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation; 
                
    announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, technologies or assets by us or our competitor; 
                
    changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; 
                
    price and volume fluctuations  attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; 
                
    our public float relative to the total number of shares of our common stock that are issued and outstanding; 
                
    price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; 
     
   40 

     Table of Contents  

rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
                
    the dissemination of adverse or misleading reports or opinions about our business; 
                
    any major change in our management; 
                
    unfavorable economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and 
                
    other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism. 
       
  If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price could decline. 
    
  The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our company, we could lose visibility in the financial market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities or industry analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
    
  We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
    
  We have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. 
  Our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that stockholders consider favorable and cause our stock price to decline. 
  Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that the stockholders of our company consider favorable. These provisions: 
             
    authorize the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; 
                
    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders; 
                
    establish advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; 
                
    limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; 
                
    prohibit stockholders from cumulating their votes for the election of directors; 
                
    permit newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by majority vote of our remaining directors, even if less than a quorum is then in office; 
                
    provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; 
                
    establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; 
                
    provide that our directors may be removed only for  cause  and only with the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3rds percent of our outstanding stock; and  
                
    require super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 
       
  Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.

  (e)        Adjustments Not Subject to Limitation  .  Any amounts paid as a result of adjustments under this   Section 1.4   shall not be subject to, limited by or applied against any deductible, basket or cap, contained in this Agreement.  The Purchase Price shall be deemed  
  
   4 

increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amounts, if any, remitted by the Buyer or the Sellers under this   Section 1.4  .

Providing the Notice of Claim shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the Seller Indemnifying Party hereunder, and the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve the Seller Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder but only if and to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Seller Indemnifying Party hereunder.   
  (b)        If there occurs an event which any Seller Indemnitee asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to   Section 7.4  , the Sellers Representative on behalf of a Seller Indemnitee shall promptly provide a Notice of Claim to the Buyer, as the party obligated to provide indemnification (the    Buyer Indemnifying Party    and together with the Seller Indemnifying Parties, each shall be referred to as an    Indemnifying Party    and collectively, the    Indemnifying Parties   ).  Providing the Notice of Claim shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the Buyer Indemnifying Party hereunder, and the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve the Buyer Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder but only if and to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Buyer Indemnifying Party hereunder.   
  (c)        In case any third-party Action or Proceeding shall be brought against any Buyer Indemnitee, Buyer, on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees shall provide a Notice of Claim to the Seller Indemnifying Party, or to the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Seller Indemnifying Party(ies), of the commencement thereof.  The Buyer Indemnitee shall then have the right, in its sole discretion, to defend and settle or resolve any such claim, and  
  
   48 

the reasonable cost and expense incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution shall be included in Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that (i) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not agree to any settlement in excess of $250,000 individually, or $500,000 in the aggregate for all such settlements, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, such prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and with the Sellers Representative agreeing to respond in writing within 15 Business Days of written notice to the Sellers Representative of a proposed settlement with an acceptance or rejection of such settlement, and in the case of an objection, the details and basis therefor), and (ii) any settlement without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative shall not in and of itself be determinative of the existence of such Losses or whether such matter is indemnifiable hereunder.  The Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Party(ies), shall have the right to participate at its or the Seller Indemnifying Party(ies) own expense in the defense of such claim (to the extent that such participation does not affect any privilege relating to any Buyer Indemnitee) but shall not be entitled to assume or control the defense of such claim. 
  (d)        Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party (or, if applicable, the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Indemnifying Party) shall have 20 calendar days to contest its indemnification obligation with respect to such claim, or the amount thereof, by written notice to the Indemnitee (the    Contest Notice    provided, however, that if, at the time a Notice of Claim is submitted to the Indemnifying Party the amount of the Loss in respect thereof has not yet been determined, such 20-day period in respect of, but only in respect of the amount of the Loss, shall not commence until a further written notice (the    Notice of Liability   ) has been sent or delivered by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party (or, if applicable, the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Indemnifying Party) setting forth the amount of the Loss that was the subject of the earlier Notice of Claim.  Such Contest Notice shall specify the reasons or bases for the objection of the Indemnifying Party to the claim, and if the objection relates to the amount of the Loss asserted, the amount, if any, that the Indemnifying Party believes is due the Indemnitee, and any undisputed amount shall be promptly paid over to the Indemnitee.  If no such Contest Notice is given within such 20-day period, the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to pay the Indemnitee the amount of the Loss set forth in the Notice of Claim, or subsequent Notice of Liability, shall be deemed established and accepted by the Indemnifying Party. 
  (e)        If a Contest Notice is provided to the Indemnitee within the 20-day period referred to in   Section 7.5(d)  , the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party (or, if applicable, the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Indemnifying Party) shall attempt in good faith for 45 days after the Indemnitee s receipt of the Contest Notice to resolve such objection.  If the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party (or, if applicable, the Sellers Representative on behalf of such Indemnifying Party) shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties.  If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 45-day period, either the Buyer or Sellers Representative may submit the dispute to mandatory, final and binding arbitration pursuant to   Section 10.15   below and the decision  
  
   49 

of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in the relevant Notice of Claim shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. 
  (f)        Subject to the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall make any payment required to be made under this Article in cash and on demand (to the extent, if applicable, that such amount is not recovered by Buyer from the Escrow Fund).  Any payments required to be paid by an Indemnifying Party under this Article that are not paid within 10 Business Days of the date on which such obligation becomes final shall thereafter be deemed delinquent, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnitee, immediately upon demand, interest at the rate of 5% per annum, not to exceed the maximum nonusurious rate allowed by applicable Law, from the date such payment becomes delinquent to the date of payment of such delinquent sums, which interest shall be considered to be Losses of the Indemnitee.

Any and all Losses due to any of the Buyer Indemnitees that are recoverable from the Escrow Fund shall be recovered (i) first from the Escrow Contribution Amount of the Other Sellers (pro rata based on the Other Sellers  relative Pro Rata Ownership (excluding Extension Holdings)), and then (ii) from Extension Holding s Escrow Contribution Amount. 
  (b)        Recovery Beyond Escrow Fund  .  Subsequent to either (i) release and distribution of the remainder of the Escrow Fund pursuant to   Section 7.9   or (ii) payment to the Buyer Indemnitees or claims of the full Escrow Amount for Losses pursuant to indemnification obligations of the Sellers, any and all amounts due to any of the Buyer Indemnities pursuant to this   Article VII   shall be paid by the Sellers based on each Seller s Pro Rata Share.    
   
  7.9        Escrow Release  .  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, such portion of the Escrow Fund at the Escrow Termination Date as in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Buyer shall be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claim for Losses specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the Sellers Representative prior to the Escrow Termination Date  
  
   52 

shall be retained by the Escrow Agent until such claim for Losses has been resolved or satisfied.  At the Escrow Termination Date, the remainder of the Escrow Fund, if any, less any amounts remaining in respect of unresolved or unsatisfied claims pursuant to the previous sentence, shall be released and distributed promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) to the Sellers or the Sellers Representative for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the portion of each such Seller s Escrow Contribution Amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund. With respect to any amounts retained following the Escrow Termination Date, such amounts shall be released to the Sellers or the Sellers Representative (for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the portion of each such Seller s Escrow Contribution Amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund) within five (5) Business Days following the resolution or satisfaction of all such claims, net any amounts therefrom used to satisfy a Seller s indemnification obligations with respect to such claims, in accordance with this   Article VII  . 
   
  7.10        Materiality and Knowledge Determinations.  Materiality standards or qualifications in any representation, warranty or covenant shall be taken into account only in determining whether a breach of or default in connection with such representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of any Losses with respect to such breach, default or failure to be true and correct.  The Knowledge qualifiers in (i) the fourth sentence of Section 3.13(i), (ii) the third sentence of Section 3.13(j), (iii) the fourth sentence of Section 3.13(j), and (iv) the penultimate sentence of Section 3.13(j), shall be disregarded in determining whether a breach of the representations in such sentences exists and the amount of Losses if and to the extent of the portion of such claim(s) that are recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees from the Escrow Fund. 
   
  7.11        Treatment of Indemnification Payments  .  Any indemnity payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for federal and state income tax purposes. 
   
  7.12        Inconsistent Provisions.  The provisions of this Article VII shall govern and control over any inconsistent provisions of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Article VIII. 
   
  ARTICLE VIII          TAX MATTERS 
   
  8.1        Retention of Records.  The Buyer and the Sellers shall retain, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to retain, all Tax Records in its possession for all open Tax Periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date, until 6 months following the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax Periods.   Tax Records  means any Tax Return, Tax Return workpapers, documentation relating to any Audit, and any other books of account or records required or advisable to be maintained under applicable Tax Law. 
   
  8.2        Cooperation.  The Buyer and the Sellers covenant and agree that subsequent to the Closing, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, they and their Affiliates will (i) give the other parties and their respective Representatives information, books and records (or copies thereof) relevant to the Company, to the extent necessary to enable each of the other parties to prepare its Tax Returns (and any Tax Returns for which it has preparation or filing responsibility hereunder) or determine any Tax-related amount which the requesting party may be entitled to  
  
   53 

receive pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) provide the other parties and their respective Representatives with such information, books and records (or copies thereof) as may reasonably be requested in connection with any Tax Return, inquiry, election, Audit or other examination by any Tax Authority, or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes.  The Buyer and the Sellers also shall make available to each other, as reasonably requested, and at the expense of the requesting party, knowledgeable employees or advisors of the party or its Affiliates of which the request is made and personnel responsible for preparing and maintaining information, books, records and documents in connection with Tax filings, Audits, disputes or litigation. 
   
  8.3        Transfer Taxes.  All transfer, documentary, recording, sales, use, registration, stamp and other similar taxes, fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers.  Each party covenants to cooperate in timely making and filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of Laws relating to such Transfer Taxes. 
   
  8.4        Tax Returns.     
  (a)        The Sellers Representative shall, at the Sellers  expense prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed with any Tax Authority with respect to the Company for all Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns to the extent not included in the calculation of the Purchase Price.  The Buyer shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns to the extent of any applicable accruals specifically included within the calculation of the Purchase Price.  The Sellers Representative shall provide the Buyer with drafts of such Tax Returns at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account extensions) for the Buyer s review and comment and shall incorporate all reasonable comments from the Buyer to the extent consistent with the requirements of applicable Tax Law (as determined by the Sellers Representative in good faith).  In the event of any income Tax Returns of the Company prepared on a pass-through basis, Sellers shall report all items of income, gain, deduction or loss consistently with the Company s Tax Returns as prepared and filed under this   Section 8.4(a)  . 
  (b)        The Buyer shall, at the Buyer s expense, prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file all Tax Returns for all Tax Periods ending after the Closing Date, which include all Tax Returns for periods which include but do not end on the Closing Date (   Straddle Periods   ) (the    Buyer Returns   ).  With respect to any Buyer Return covering any Straddle Period, the Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with a substantially final draft of each such Tax Return at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account extensions) for the Sellers Representative s review and comment and shall incorporate all reasonable comments from the Sellers Representative to the extent consistent with the requirements of applicable Tax Law (as determined by the Buyer in good faith).  The Buyer shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns and the Sellers shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for any such Taxes which are their responsibility pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent not included in the calculation of the Purchase Price. 
  
   54 

(c)        Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, any Tax Return that includes any of the Company s assets or activities for any Pre-Closing Period shall be prepared in accordance with the Sellers  past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question except to the extent that the Party preparing the Tax Return reasonably determines, in good faith, that such past Tax accounting practices are not consistent with applicable Tax Law.  In the case of any Tax Return for the Company for any Straddle Period, any income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated based on the principles of   Section 8.5(a)   of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including without limitation   Article VII  ), if the Buyer reasonably determines, in good faith, that under applicable Tax Law the Company was required to have filed Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods in jurisdictions in which the Company has not previously filed Tax Returns, the Buyer will so notify the Sellers Representative and, unless the Sellers Representative reasonably and in good faith disagrees that such Tax Returns were required to be filed by applicable Tax Law, the Sellers Representative shall, at the Sellers  expense, prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file all such Tax Returns and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; provided, however, that if the Sellers Representative reasonably and in good faith disagrees with Buyer s determination that any such Tax Returns are required to be filed, the Arbiter designated in   Section 1.4(c)   shall be engaged to resolve the disagreement on substantially the same terms set forth in   Section 1.4(c)   for resolution of the Challenged Amount. 
  (d)        To the extent an election under Section 754 of the Code is not already in effect for the Company, as a protective measure, the Sellers and the Company shall, if not already in effect, cause the election provided by Code Section 754 in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.754-1(b) to be made effective for the taxable period of the Company that includes the Closing Date. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax deductions attributable to or arising from any and all payments on or with respect to any equity, bonus, severance payments, or other payments or any vesting that become payable or vested as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, be reported and deducted by the Company (and each Seller, as the case may be) on its applicable Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. 
   
  8.5        Allocation of Taxes. 
  (a)        Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes  .  The Buyer and the Sellers shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law and except as otherwise provided herein, elect with the relevant Tax Authority to close the Tax Period of the Company as of and including the Closing Date.  Subject to the preceding sentence, in the case of Taxes attributable to the Company that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period the portion of any such Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall:  (1) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,  
  
   55 

tangible or intangible) be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year ended on and included the Closing Date and (2) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (1)) imposed on a period basis with respect to the business or assets of the Company or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax Period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period (the    Part-Year Fraction   ).  For purposes of clause (1) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period times the Part-Year Fraction.  In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this   Section 8.5(a)   shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date.  The Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay any Taxes (in excess of any applicable accruals therefor included within the calculation of the Purchase Price) allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay any Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period after the Closing Date. 
  (b)        Post-Closing Tax Periods  .  From and after the Closing Date, for the portion of any Straddle Period that begins on the day after the Closing Date and any other Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date, without duplication of any amount otherwise payable by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall be responsible and pay, or cause the Company to pay, to the appropriate Tax Authority any other Taxes due with respect to the Company for any such period.  For the sake of clarity, this   Section 8.5(b)   shall not be construed to limit or qualify the Buyer s rights to indemnification for Losses pursuant to   Article VII  . 
  (c)        Tax Refunds  .  Buyer shall promptly remit to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) any refund of Taxes of the Company received after the Closing Date and relating to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period (not including any refund included in calculation of the Purchase Price, and net of any reasonable costs attributable to the receipt of such Tax Refunds) to the extent the Taxes were paid by the Sellers or, prior to the Closing Date, the Company or reflected in the Purchase Price.  Any refund of Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Taxable Period and the period after the Closing Date in accordance with   Section 8.5(a)  . 
   
  8.6        Contests. 
  (a)        Notices  .  After the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Sellers each shall notify the other in writing within 10 Business Days of receipt of any notice of the commencement of any Tax Audit or administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the Taxes of the Company in respect to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or the Straddle Periods, the outcome  
  
   56 

of which may affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations under this Agreement of the other party (   Tax Indemnitor   ).  Such notice shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in respect of such Audit or other proceeding.  If either the Buyer or the Sellers fail to give the other party prompt notice as required under this Agreement, then such failure shall not limit the Tax Indemnitor s obligation to indemnify under this Agreement for any loss or damage arising out of such asserted Tax Liability, except to the extent the Tax Indemnitor was actually and materially prejudiced by the other Party s failure to provide prompt notice. 
  (b)        Control of Contests  .  The Sellers Representative shall control the defense and settlement of any Tax Controversy involving any asserted liability for Taxes imposed with respect to the Company relating to Tax Periods that end on or before the Closing Date.  The Buyer shall control the defense and settlement of any other Tax Controversy involving any asserted liability for Taxes imposed with respect to the Company, including with respect to Taxes for Straddle Periods and any Taxes for Tax Periods that end after the Closing Date. 
  (c)        Procedures  .  If the resolution of any Tax Controversy involving a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of the Company would be grounds for indemnification under this Agreement by the party not in control of the conduct of such Tax Controversy (the    Non-Controlling Party   ) or otherwise adversely affect the Tax Liability of the Non-Controlling Party, (i) the party in control of such Tax Controversy (the    Controlling Party   ) shall keep the Non-Controlling Party fully informed of any proceedings, events, and developments relating to or in connection with such Tax Controversy; (ii) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to receive copies of all substantive correspondence and documents relating to such Tax Controversy; (iii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Controversy without the Non-Controlling Party s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iv) at its own cost and expense, the Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to participate (but not control) the defense of such Tax Controversy; provided however, that clauses (i) through (iv) shall apply only in respect of the portion of such Tax Controversy, correspondence and documents that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and/or Straddle Periods of the Company. 
   
  8.7        Miscellaneous. 
  (a)        Character of Payments  .  Any payment made by the Sellers, the Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Company) under this   Article VIII   shall constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes. 
  (b)        No Duplication  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Article VIII  , the Sellers shall not have any Liability for, and shall not be required to pay Buyer, any amounts pursuant to this   Article VIII   or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement for any Taxes that were taken into account in determining the Purchase Price.

10.14        Sellers Representative. 
  (a)        Sellers Representative  .  Each Seller, by executing this Agreement, does hereby, for itself or himself and its or his heirs, representatives and successors, irrevocably constitute and appoint Jon Jensen as such Seller s sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative (in such capacity, the    Sellers Representative   ) to take any and all actions required or permitted to be taken by the Sellers Representative or the Sellers under or in connection with this Agreement, and for the following additional purposes: 
  (i)        To execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby as the Sellers Representative, in his sole discretion, determines to be necessary or desirable; 
  (ii)        To collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property payable to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the withholding of amounts necessary to pay expenses in accordance with   Section 10.1  , to cause the same to be disbursed to the Sellers; 
  (iii)        To enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Sellers or any of them arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any other agreement, document, instrument or certificate relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and, in connection therewith, to assert, institute, investigate, defend, contest, litigate, prosecute and appeal any claim with respect thereto; to compromise or settle any such claim on such terms as the Sellers Representative shall determine to be appropriate; and give receipts, releases and discharges on behalf of all of the Sellers with respect to any such claim; 
  (iv)        To refrain from enforcing any rights and interests of the Sellers  arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, any Related Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; and 
  (v)        To make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, assignments, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things on behalf of such Sellers and to take any and all action that the Sellers Representative, in his sole discretion, may consider necessary, proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the activities described in paragraphs (i) through (iv) above. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall not have any authority, except in the case of a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by a particular Seller, to take any action which adversely affects a Seller materially and disproportionately to any other Seller.  No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative.  Notices or communications to or from the Sellers Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Sellers.  The appointment of the Sellers Representative as each Seller s attorney-in-fact  
  
   62

  (g)        Exculpation  .  The Sellers Representative shall act for the Sellers on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Sellers Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Sellers and is authorized to act on behalf of the Sellers notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers.  In performing his responsibilities under this Agreement or any instruments, agreements or documents relating hereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Sellers Representative hereunder, (i) the Sellers Representative assumes and shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act that represents gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (ii) the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Sellers Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Sellers Representative to liability to any Seller.

   64 

(iii)        If the Sellers Representative has been removed or is unable or unavailable to perform his duties hereunder, or the Sellers Representative shall have resigned without appointing a successor Sellers Representative, a successor Sellers Representative shall be appointed by Sellers who held a majority of the outstanding Membership Interests immediately prior to the Closing.  In the event that the Sellers fail to agree upon a successor Sellers Representative with 30 calendar days of the removal, resignation or other termination of the Sellers Representative, the successor Sellers Representative shall be appointed by Extension Holdings, LLC. 
  (i)        Survival  .  All of the immunities and powers granted to the Sellers Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue thereafter in full force and effect. 
   
  10.15        Arbitration. 
  (a)        The parties hereby agree that the arbitration procedure set forth in this   Section 10.15   shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving and remedying Disputes.  In the event of a Dispute, any party may commence arbitration hereunder by delivering to each other party involved therein a written notice of arbitration (a    Notice of Arbitration   ).  Such Notice of Arbitration shall specify the matters as to which arbitration is sought, the nature of any Dispute, the amount and nature of any Losses, if any, sought to be recovered as a result of any alleged claim, and any other matters required by the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the Expedited Procedures in those Rules of JAMS (the    JAMS Rules   ), as in effect from time to time, to be included therein, if any.  The arbitration provisions of this   Section 10.15   shall govern over any conflicting rules that may now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS Rules. 
  (b)        The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall each select one independent arbitrator with experience in the subject matter of the Dispute (the arbitrators so selected shall be referred to herein as    Buyer s Arbitrator    and    Sellers Representative s Arbitrator  ,  respectively).  In the event that either such party fails to select an independent arbitrator as set forth herein within 20 calendar days after delivery of a Notice of Arbitration, then the matter shall be resolved by the arbitrator selected by the other party.  Sellers Representative s Arbitrator and Buyer s Arbitrator shall select a third independent arbitrator with experience in the subject matter of the Dispute, and the three arbitrators so selected shall resolve the matter according to the procedures set forth in this   Section 10.15  .  If Sellers Representative s Arbitrator and Buyer s Arbitrator are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within 30 calendar days after delivery of a Notice of Arbitration, Buyer s Arbitrator and Sellers Representative s Arbitrator shall each prepare a list of three independent arbitrators with experience in the subject matter of the Dispute and send such list to the other within 40 calendar days after the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration.  Buyer s Arbitrator and Sellers Representative s Arbitrator shall each have the opportunity to designate as objectionable and eliminate one arbitrator from the other arbitrator s list within 50 calendar days after the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration, and the third arbitrator shall then be selected by lot from the arbitrators remaining on the lists submitted by Buyer s Arbitrator and Sellers Representative s  
  
   65 

Arbitrator, which selection shall take place within 60 calendar days after the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration.  In the event that either Buyer s Arbitrator or Sellers Representative s Arbitrator fails to send its list of arbitrators to the other within the timeframe described above, or to thereafter notify the other of the elimination of one arbitrator from the other s list within the timeframe described above, then the third arbitrator shall be selected by the arbitrator that did not so fail, which selection shall be made from the list of arbitrators provided by such non-failing arbitrator as described above. 
  (c)        The arbitrator(s) selected pursuant to this   Section 10.15   will determine the allocation of the costs and expenses of arbitration based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.  For example, if the Buyer submits a claim for $100,000, and if the Sellers Representative contests only $50,000 of the amount claimed by the Buyer, and if the arbitrators ultimately resolve the Dispute by awarding the Buyer $30,000 of the $50,000 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 30,000   50,000) to the Sellers Representative (subject to reimbursement under   Section 10.14(d)  ) and 40% (i.e., 20,000   50,000) to the Buyer. 
  (d)        The arbitration shall be conducted in the State of California, County of Santa Clara, under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the Expedited Procedures in those Rules of JAMS as in effect from time to time, except as modified by the mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative.  The arbitrator(s) shall so conduct the arbitration that a final result, determination, finding, judgment and/or award (the    Final Determination   ) is made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 calendar days after the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration.  The Final Determination must be agreed upon and signed by the sole arbitrator, if only one arbitrator conducted the arbitration, or by at least two of the three arbitrators that conducted the arbitration (as the case may be).  The Final Determination shall be final and binding on all parties and there shall be no appeal from or reexamination of the Final Determination, except for fraud, perjury or misconduct by the sole arbitrator or at least two of the arbitrator(s) if more than one prejudicing the rights of any party and except to correct manifest clerical errors.  A Final Determination may be enforced in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the Dispute. 
  (e)        The parties shall keep confidential all awards in arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the arbitration proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent disclosure is required by Law, legal process, regulation or judicial order by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, or to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in Law before a court or other judicial authority permitted by this   Section 10.15  . 
  (f)        A party may apply either to a court of competent jurisdiction, or to the arbitrator(s) if appointed, for prejudgment remedies and emergency relief pending final determination of a claim in accordance with this   Section 10.15  .  The appointment of the  
  
   66 

arbitrator(s) does not preclude a party form seeking prejudgment remedies and emergency relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  (g)        For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this   Section 10.15   shall not be applicable to the determination of claims or disputes that are not Disputes, and a proceeding with respect to any such claim or dispute that is not a Dispute is subject to   Section 10.10   of this Agreement.  Subject to   Section 10.10  , nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any party from seeking provisional measures from any court of competent jurisdiction, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate. 
   
  10.16        WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, FOR ANY PROCEEDING WHICH IS PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO BE FILED IN A COURT, EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN SUCH PROCEEDING, INCLUDING THOSE PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, CONSENT, WAIVER, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THEM OR ARISING FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS.  EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE MATTERS SHALL BE TRIED TO A COURT AND NOT TO A JURY.  EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.16.

It is further acknowledged that although the Firm has in the past represented Extension Holdings, LLC, which is one of the Sellers, and may continue to represent Extension Holdings, LLC in the future, the Firm is not representing Extension Holdings, LLC or any other Seller or the Sellers Representative in connection with the Current Representation and accordingly the Company is the Firm s only client in connection with the Current Representation. 
  (b)        Affirmation of Representation  .  The Buyer hereby agrees that, and agrees to cause the Company following the Closing to agree that, after the Closing, the Firm may  
  
   67 

represent the Sellers Representative, any Seller, and any officer, director, manager, employee, shareholder, partner or member of the Sellers Representative and/or any Seller (any such Person, a    Designated Person   ) in any matter involving or arising from the Current Representation, including any interpretation or application of this Agreement or any Related Agreement, and including for the avoidance of doubt any litigation, arbitration, dispute or mediation between or among the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, and any Designated Person, even though the interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. 
  (c)        Waiver of Conflict  .  The Buyer hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company following the Closing to waive and not assert, (i) any claim that the Firm has a conflict of interest in any representation described in   Section 10.17(b)  , and (ii) any confidentiality obligation with respect to any communication between the Firm and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation. 
  (d)        Retention of Privilege  .  The Buyer hereby agrees that, and agrees to cause the Company following the Closing to agree that, as to all communications (whether before, at or after the Closing) between the Firm and any Designated Person that relate in any way to the Current Representation, the attorney-client privilege and all rights to any other evidentiary privilege, and the protections afforded to information relating to representation of a client under applicable rules of professional conduct, belong to such Designated Person and may be controlled by such Designated Person and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer or, following the Closing, by the Company.  Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any policy of the Buyer or the Company or any agreement between the Company and any Designated Person or any Representative of any Designated Person or the Company, whether established or entered into before, at or after the Closing, neither the Buyer nor the Company may, following the Closing, seek to compel disclosure to the Buyer or the Company (or any of their Representatives) any communication or information (whether written, oral, electronic or in any other medium) described in the previous sentence.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Sellers, and a Person other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third-party of confidential communications by Firm to the Company or the Sellers; provided, however, that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative. 
   
  10.18        Remedies Cumulative.  Except as otherwise provided herein (including without limitation in Section 7.7(g)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other  
  
   68 

remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein.

  Vocera Communications, Inc. Non-Competition Agreement 
  This   Non-Competition Agreement   (this    Agreement   ), dated October 27, 2016 is made by and between the undersigned employee (the    Employee   ) of Extension, LLC, an Indiana limited liability corporation (the    Company   ) and Vocera Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (   Buyer   ).  For purposes of this Agreement,  Buyer  shall be deemed to include Buyer and its wholly and majority-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries and other affiliates, successors or assigns that operate the Business (as defined below) of the Company, including, but not limited to the Company.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the MIPA (as defined below).  
  Background 
  Buyer, the Company and certain other parties have entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the    MIPA   ), pursuant to which Buyer will acquire all of the outstanding units of the Company and the Company will become a subsidiary of Buyer (the    Transaction   ).   
  Employee understands and agrees that Employee is a substantial unitholder of the Company and a key and significant member of either management and/or the technical workforce of the Company and that Employee will receive substantial consideration and/or an offer of employment with Buyer as a result of the Transaction.  Employee is willing to enter into this Agreement as a condition of the closing of the Transaction and to protect Buyer s legitimate interests as a Buyer of the units of the Company.  Employee understands and acknowledges that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Employee is a material inducement to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the MIPA, and a material condition to Buyer consummating the transactions contemplated by the MIPA. 
  Buyer and Employee both agree that, prior to the Transaction, the Company conducted the Business (as defined below) throughout each of the fifty states of the United States and other parts of the world     (the    Restrictive Territory   ).      Buyer represents and Employee understands that, following the Transaction, Buyer will conduct the Business (as defined below) in the Restrictive Territory. 
  Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Employee, intending to be legally bound, agrees as follows: 
  1.  Agreement Not to Compete  .  During the Restrictive Period (as defined below), Employee agrees that he will not, as an employee, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor, general partner, officer, director, stockholder, investor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or other entity, or in any other capacity directly or indirectly: 
  (a)  participate or engage in, or render any services to any business engaged in, the design, development, manufacture, operation, production, marketing, sale or servicing of any product, or the provision of any service, that  relates to healthcare communications, including point-of-care clinical alarm management, middleware, and patient monitoring (hereafter     referred to as the    Business   ) in the Restrictive Territory;  or 
  (b)  permit Employee s name to be used in connection with a business, which is directly competitive or substantially similar to the Business. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, up to one percent (1%) of any class of  publicly traded securities  of any business that is competitive or substantially  

similar to the Business.  The term  publicly traded securities  shall mean securities that are traded on a national securities exchange.   
  For purposes of this Agreement, the restrictive period (referred to herein as the    Restrictive Period   ) shall commence on the Closing Date (as defined in the MIPA) of the Transaction and shall continue until the later of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of Employee s relationship with Buyer for any reason, whether Employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated by Buyer for any reason;   provided  ,   however  , that subject to clause (C) below, (A) in no event shall the Restrictive Period continue beyond the forty-eight (48) month anniversary of the Closing Date; (B) if Employee does not become an employee of Buyer immediately following the Closing, the Restrictive Period shall end on the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date; and (C) in the event that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator, as the case may be, that Employee has breached any provision of this Section 1, then, in addition to any remedies set forth in this Agreement and available under applicable law,     the Restrictive Period shall be automatically extended by a number of days equal to the total number of days in the period from the date on which such breach shall have first occurred through the date as of which such breach shall have been fully cured. 
  2.  Agreement Not to Solicit  .  Employee further agrees that during the Non-Solicitation Period (as defined below), Employee will not as an employee, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor, general partner, officer, director, stockholder, investor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or other entity, or in any other capacity,  directly or indirectly for Employee or on behalf of any other Person (other than Buyer or any of its affiliates) without the prior written consent of Buyer: 
    
  (a)  interfere with the relationship between Buyer and its employees or consultants or contractors by encouraging, inducing, soliciting or attempting to solicit any such employee or consultant or contractor to terminate his or her employment or end his or her relationship with Buyer;  
  (b)  solicit or attempt to solicit for employment on behalf of Employee or any other Person, any Person (i) who is an employee, consultant or contractor of Buyer or (ii) who was an employee, consultant or contractor of Buyer at any time during the twelve (12)-month period prior to such solicitation or attempt to solicit; or 
  (c)  induce, encourage or assist any other Person to engage in any of the activities described in subparagraphs (a) through (b). 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, (A) the placement of general advertisements that may be targeted to a particular geographic or technical area but that are not specifically targeted toward employees of Buyer shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 2 and (B) Employee may solicit and engage as a part-time independent contractor any Person who is performing or has in the past performed part-time services for Buyer as an independent contractor so long as such engagement by Employee is not related to the Business.  
  For purposes of this Agreement, the non-solicitation period (referred to herein as the    Non-Solicitation Period   ) shall commence on the Closing Date of the Transaction and shall continue until the later of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of Employee s relationship with Buyer for any reason, whether Employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated by Buyer for any reason;   provided  ,   however  , that subject to clause (C) below, (A) in no event shall the Non-Solicitation Period continue beyond the forty-eight (48) month anniversary of the Closing  

Date; (B) if Employee does not become an employee of Buyer immediately following the Closing, the Non-Solicitation Period shall end on the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date; and (C) in the event that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator, as the case may be, that Employee has breached any provision of this Section 2, then, in addition to any remedies set forth in this Agreement and available under applicable law,     the Non-Solicitation Period shall be automatically extended by a number of days equal to the total number of days in the period from the date on which such breach shall have first occurred through the date as of which such breach shall have been fully cured. 
  3.  Acknowledgment  .  Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that: 
    
  (a)  this Agreement is necessary for the protection of the legitimate business interests of Buyer in acquiring all of the units of the Company; 
  (b)  the execution and delivery and continuation in force of this Agreement is a material inducement to Buyer to execute the MIPA and is a mandatory condition precedent to the closing of the Transaction, without which Buyer would not close the transactions contemplated by the MIPA; 
  (c)  the scope of this Agreement in time, geography and types and limitations of activities restricted is reasonable; 
  (d)  Employee has no intention of competing with the Business acquired by Buyer within the area and the time limits set forth in this Agreement;  
  (e)  breach of this Agreement will be such that Buyer will not have an adequate remedy at law because of the unique nature of the operations and the units being acquired by Buyer;  
  (f)  execution of this Agreement shall not limit Buyer s employee policies, including without limitation, the provisions set forth in Buyer s proprietary information and invention assignment agreement (the    PIIA     
  (g)  Employee represents and warrants that Employee s expertise and capabilities are such that Employee s obligations under this Agreement (and the enforcement thereof by injunction or otherwise) will not prevent Employee from earning a livelihood; and 
  (h)  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee has had adequate opportunity to consult with counsel prior to entering into this Agreement. 
  4.  Remedy  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that (a) the rights of Buyer under this Agreement are of a specialized and unique character and that immediate and irreparable damage will result to Buyer if Employee fails to or refuses to perform Employee s obligations under this Agreement and (b) Buyer may, in addition to any other remedies and damages available, seek an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain any such failure or refusal.  No single exercise of the foregoing remedies shall be deemed to exhaust Buyer s right to such remedies, but the right to such remedies shall continue undiminished and may be exercised from time to time as often as Buyer may elect.   
  5.  Agreement Not to Disparage  .  Employee agrees that Employee will not directly or indirectly for Employee or on behalf of any other Person (other than Buyer or any of its affiliates) libel, slander or disparage Buyer in any manner that is harmful to the business, business reputation or personal reputation of Buyer.  This section does preclude Employee from testifying truthfully to a lawful subpoena.   
  6.  Severability  .  If any provisions of this Agreement as applied to any part or to any circumstances shall be adjudged by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision of this Agreement, the application of such provision in any other circumstances, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.  Buyer and Employee intend this Agreement to be enforced as written.  If any provision, or part thereof, however, is held to be unenforceable because of the duration thereof or the area covered thereby, all parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision, and/or to delete specific words or phrases and in its reduced form such provision shall then be enforceable. 

7.  Miscellaneous  .  In the event that the MIPA is terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.  Provided that the Transaction is consummated, the terms of this Agreement shall apply regardless of whether Employee becomes employed by or provides services to Buyer on the Closing Date and shall continue to apply notwithstanding the termination of Employee s employment with or services to Buyer.  This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Buyer s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel, or his or her designee, and Employee.  No waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continued waiver of any breach of any other term or agreement contained in this Agreement.  References contained in this Agreement to the term including shall be interpreted to mean including without limitation.  The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   
  8.  Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted and its performance shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana without regard to conflicts of law principles of any jurisdiction. 
  9.  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (but does not in any way merge or supersede the MIPA or any other agreement executed in connection with the MIPA, including the Employee s offer letter with Buyer, if any, and Employee s PIIA, if any).

  (d)        Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the validity or sufficiency of any Claim Notice, Claim Response or Notice of Liability or whether any Claim Notice, Claim Response or Notice of Liability has been received by, or to provide a copy of any Claim Notice, Claim Response or Notice of Liability to, any of Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative or the Sellers Representative.  Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that any Claim Notice, Claim Response or Notice of Liability delivered to it has been simultaneously delivered to Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be. 
    
  7.        Investment of Funds  .  Based upon Sellers Representative s prior review of investment alternatives, in the absence of further specific written direction to the contrary, Escrow Agent is directed to initially invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in the investment indicated on Schedule B hereto. Sellers Representative acknowledges receipt from Escrow Agent of a current copy of the prospectus for the investment authorized in Schedule B.  Sellers Representative may provide written direction changing the investment of the Escrow Funds to Escrow Agent, upon which direction Escrow Agent shall conclusively rely without inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that Sellers Representative warrants that no investment or reinvestment direction shall be given except in the following:  (a) direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America; (b) U.S. dollar denominated deposit accounts and certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank and trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates), which are either (i) insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to FDIC limits, or (ii) with domestic commercial banks which have a rating on their short-term certificates of deposit on the date of purchase of  A-1  or  A-l+  by S P or  P-1  by Moody s and maturing no more than 360 days after the date of purchase (ratings on holding companies are not considered as the rating of the bank); (c) repurchase agreements with any bank, trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or (d) institutional money market funds, including funds managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates; provided further, however, that Escrow Agent will not be directed to invest in investments that Escrow Agent determines are not consistent with Escrow Agent s policies or practices.  Purchaser and Sellers Representative recognize and agree that Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any  

investment described herein.

  If Escrow Agent has not received a written investment instruction from Sellers Representative at any time that an investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent is directed to invest the Escrow Funds, or such portion thereof as to which no written investment instruction has been received, in the investment indicated on Schedule B hereto.  All investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may, without notice to Purchaser and Sellers Representative, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing investments at any time for any disbursement of Escrow Funds permitted or required hereunder.  All investment earnings shall become part of the Escrow Funds and investment losses shall be charged against the Escrow Funds.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in the value of any investment made pursuant to this Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of any such investment.  With respect to any Escrow Funds or investment instruction received by Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m., Central Time, Escrow Agent shall not be required to invest such funds or to effect any investment instruction until the next day upon which Escrow Agent is open to conduct its regular banking business.  Receipt of the Escrow Funds and investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent by an account statement, and Purchaser or Sellers Representative may inform Escrow Agent in writing of any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such account statement.   
    
  8.        Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent  .  Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10) days  prior written notice to Purchaser and Sellers Representative specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect and, after the date of such resignation notice, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Escrow Agent s sole obligation will be to hold the Escrow Funds pending appointment of a successor Escrow Agent.  Similarly, Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by Purchaser and Sellers Representative giving at least thirty (30) days  prior written notice to Escrow Agent specifying the date when such removal shall take effect.  Purchaser and Sellers Representative jointly shall appoint a successor Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation or removal.

After any retiring Escrow Agent s resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be  

taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement, including without limitation any other agreement between any or all of the parties hereto or any other persons even though reference thereto may be made herein and whether or not a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its breach of this Agreement was the sole cause of any loss to Purchaser or Sellers Representative. Escrow Agent may retain and act hereunder through agents, and shall not be responsible for or have any liability with respect to the acts of any such agent retained by Escrow Agent in good faith, provided that any such agent s retention was not grossly negligent.  Escrow Agent s sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping of the Escrow Funds in accordance with Escrow Agent s customary practices and disbursement thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to make any calculations under this Agreement, or to determine when any calculation required under the provisions of this Agreement should be made, how it should be made or what it should be, or to confirm or verify any such calculation.  Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth herein.  Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the person or parties purporting to sign the same.  In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for (a) acting in accordance with or conclusively relying upon any instruction, notice, demand, certificate or document believed by Escrow Agent to have been created by or on behalf of Purchaser or Sellers Representative,  (b) incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages or penalties of any kind (including, but not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such damages or penalty and regardless of the form of action or (c) any amount greater than the value of the Escrow Funds as valued upon deposit with Escrow Agent.  Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control, including without limitation acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war or terror, epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, attacks or intrusions, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters.  Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow Funds are deposited, this Agreement or the Underlying Agreement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding or to take any other action that in Escrow Agent s sole judgment may expose it to potential expense or liability.  Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel.  Purchaser and  

Sellers Representative, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel.  Purchaser and Sellers Representative agree to perform or procure the performance of all further acts and things, and execute and deliver such further documents, as may be required by law or as Escrow Agent may reasonably request in connection with its duties hereunder. 
    
  Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow Funds, without determination by Escrow Agent of such court s jurisdiction in the matter.  If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it, without the need for appeal or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.  
    
  10.        Indemnification of Escrow Agent  .  Purchaser and Sellers Representative, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (each, an    Indemnified Party   ) upon demand against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses of any kind or nature (including without limitation reasonable attorneys  fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) threatened, asserted or initiated by any person or entity, including without limitation Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative and the Sellers Representative, arising from or in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such suit, action or proceeding or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been directly caused solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party in connection with Escrow Agent s breach of this Agreement.  Purchaser and Sellers Representative further agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party for all costs, including without limitation reasonable attorney s fees, incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Purchaser s and Sellers Representative s obligations hereunder.  Each Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by Purchaser and Sellers Representative jointly and severally.  The obligations of Purchaser and Sellers Representative under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. 

Purchaser and Sellers Representative agree that neither the payment by Purchaser or Sellers Representative of any claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification shall impair, limit, modify or affect, as between Purchaser and Sellers Representative, the respective rights and obligations of Purchaser and Sellers Representative under the Underlying Agreement. 
    
  11.        Compensation of Escrow Agent  .

  (b)  Disbursements from Escrow Funds to Pay Escrow Agent  .  Escrow Agent is authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the Escrow Funds, from time to time, the amount of any compensation and reimbursement of expenses due and payable hereunder (including any amount to which Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder).  Escrow Agent shall notify Purchaser and Sellers Representative of any disbursement from the Escrow Funds to itself or any Indemnified Party in respect of any compensation or reimbursement hereunder and shall furnish Purchaser and Sellers Representative copies of related invoices and other statements.  
    
  (c)        Security and Offset  .  Purchaser and Sellers Representative hereby grant to Escrow Agent and the Indemnified Parties a first priority security interest in, lien upon and right of offset against the Escrow Funds with respect to any compensation or reimbursement due any of them hereunder (including any claim for indemnification hereunder).

    12.        Representations and Warranties  .

  In addition, the Purchaser represents and warrants to Escrow Agent that (i) each of the applicable persons designated on Schedule C attached hereto has been duly appointed to act as its authorized representative hereunder and individually has full power and authority on its behalf to execute and deliver any Joint Written Direction, to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement and to take any and all other actions as its authorized representative under this Agreement, all without further consent or direction from, or notice to, it or any other person and (ii) no change in designation of such authorized representatives shall be effective until written

(   Buyer   ), a Delaware corporation, will acquire all of the outstanding units of the Company and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (the    Transaction   ).  The consummation of the Transaction is referred to as the    Closing    and the date of the Closing is referred to as the    Closing Date  .  
           2. 
    ELIGIBILITY  
     Participation in the Plan shall be limited to employees of the Company who receive a retention bonus agreement (a    Cash Retention Bonus Agreement   ) substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A  , confirming their participation in the Plan and identifying their Cash Retention Bonus opportunity thereunder (each such employee, a    Participant   ).  The Participants in the Plan shall be selected by the Administrator (as defined below).  
           3. 
    CASH RETENTION BONUSES  
     (a)  Cash Retention Bonus Opportunities  .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan set forth herein, a Participant shall be eligible to earn a Cash Retention Bonus on the terms and in the amounts specified in his or her Cash Retention Bonus Agreement.  A Cash Retention Bonus may be subject to continued services and any other vesting requirements set forth in the applicable Cash Retention Bonus Agreement. 
  (b)  Cash Retention Bonus Amounts  .  A Participant s Cash Retention Bonus Agreement shall specify the aggregate amount of the Cash Retention Bonus that such Participant is eligible to receive under the Plan, the degree to which such Cash Retention Bonus includes any vesting requirements and the time of payment.  The value of Cash Retention Bonuses payable to Participants under the Plan shall be determined by the Administrator.   
  (c)  Restrictions on Payment  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any payment of a Cash Retention Bonus or portion thereof under the terms specified hereunder or in any of the Cash Retention Bonus Agreements shall be subject to and contingent upon the Closing and, except as otherwise specified in a Cash Retention Bonus Agreement, a Participant s continued active employment with the Company on each applicable payment date.  If the execution of a release by a Participant is required under a Participant s Cash Retention Bonus Agreement, the release shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B  . 
           4. 
    ADMINISTRATION 
     The Plan shall be administered in good faith by the Company s Board of Managers (the    Board   ) and after the Closing, the Plan shall be administered by the Buyer s Senior Director of Human Resources (the    Administrator   ).  The Administrator shall have full power to interpret and administer this Plan and the Cash Retention Bonus Agreements.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator shall have full discretion to interpret, clarify, construe or resolve any ambiguity in any provision of this Plan or any Cash Retention Bonus Agreement, accelerate or waive vesting of Cash Retention Bonuses, determine the treatment of any Cash Retention Bonuses during any leave of absence or other break in service and/or  

waive any terms or conditions applicable to any Cash Retention Bonuses, subject to the limitations set forth in   Section 7(a)  .  The Administrator shall have full and exclusive discretionary power to adopt any rules, forms, instruments and guidelines for administering this Plan as the Administrator deems necessary or proper, subject to the limitations set forth in   Section 7(a)  .  The determinations and interpretations of the Administrator under this Plan, the Cash Retention Bonus Agreements and any Cash Retention Bonuses need not be uniform and may be made selectively by the Board among Participants (whether or not similarly situated).  Subject to   Section 7(a)  , all actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding upon all Participants, the Company and all other interested parties.  The Administrator may delegate to one or more of its members, one or more officers of the Company and one or more agents or advisors such administrative duties or powers as it may deem advisable.  No member of the Administrator and no officer or employee of the Company will be liable to any person for any action taken or omitted in connection with the administration of the Plan unless attributable to such individual s fraud or willful misconduct. 
           5. 
    PARACHUTE PAYMENTS 
     In the event that a Participant s Cash Retention Bonus payable to a Participant and any other benefits otherwise payable to a Participant (i) constitute  parachute payments  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this subparagraph, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Participant s Cash Retention Bonus will be either:  (a) delivered in full, or (b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by Participant on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the C  ode.    In the event that a reduction is required, the reduction shall be applied first to any benefits that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code, and then shall be applied to benefits (if any) that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, with the benefits payable latest in time subject to reduction first.  Unless the Participant and the Company otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this subparagraph will be made in writing by the Company s public accountants immediately prior to any change of control or such other person or entity to which the parties mutually agree (the    Accountants   ), whose determination will be conclusive and binding upon Participant for all purposes.  For purposes of making the calculations required by this subparagraph, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  Participant will be required to furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this subparagraph. 
   (a)  Interpretation  .  The Company intends that that all payments and benefits under this Plan will either comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively    Section 409A   ), and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Plan shall be interpreted to be exempt from Section 409A or in compliance therewith, as applicable.  It is further  intended that payments hereunder satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemption from the application of Section 409A (and any state law of similar effect) provided under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (as a  short-term deferral ). 
  (b)  Separation from Service  . A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of the Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment, unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A  

and the payment thereof prior to a  separation from service  would violate Section 409A.  For purposes of any such provision of the Plan or relating to any such payments or benefits, references to a  termination,   termination of employment,  and like terms shall mean  separation from service.  
  (c)  Installment Payments  .  If an amount is paid in two or more installments, then for purposes of Section 409A, each installment shall be treated as a separate payment.  
  (d)  Specified Employee  .  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant is a  specified employee  on the date of his separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A and Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h), payments and benefits payable under this Plan due to a separation from service that are deferred compensation subject to (but not otherwise exempt from) Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be paid or provided during the six-month period commencing on the separation from service, will be deferred until the first day of the seventh month following the separation from service if such deferral is necessary to avoid the additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. 
           7. 
    MISCELLANEOUS 
     (a)  Term; Amendment and Termination  .  The Plan shall be effective as of the Closing Date and shall continue in effect until terminated by the Administrator.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Company may, in its sole discretion, amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate this Plan or any portion thereof or any Cash Retention Bonus (or Cash Retention Bonus Agreement) hereunder at any time;   provided  ,   that   no action taken by the Company shall materially and adversely affect the rights granted to any Participant under any outstanding Cash Retention Bonus (except as otherwise set forth in the Cash Retention Bonus Agreement or as the Company deems necessary to comply with applicable law) without the Participant s written consent. 
  (b)  Successors and Assigns  .  The Plan shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.  All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Cash Retention Bonuses granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 
  (c)  Governing Law; Severability  .  The Plan and the Cash Retention Bonus Agreements shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California (without reference to its conflicts-of-law provisions).  If any provision of the Plan, any Cash Retention Bonus Agreement or any Cash Retention Bonus is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or Cash Retention Bonus, or would disqualify the Plan, any Cash Retention Bonus Agreement or any Cash Retention Bonus under any law deemed applicable by the Company, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Company, materially altering the intent of the Plan, the Cash Retention Bonus Agreement or the Cash Retention Bonus, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Cash Retention Bonus, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Cash Retention Bonus Agreements or Cash Retention Bonus shall remain in full force and effect. 
  (d)  Tax Withholding  .  The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under the Plan such U.S. federal, state and local, and any non-U.S., taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
  (e)  Other Benefits  .  No payments under the Plan shall count toward, be substituted in lieu of, or be considered in determining payments or benefits due to a Participant under any other plan, program or agreement of the Company.  For the avoidance of doubt, payments under the Plan shall not be considered as part of a Participant s contractual salary or compensation for purposes of any calculation, including calculation of any severance, resignation, redundancy or other end-of-service payments, paid time off, commissions or other payments or benefits or rights of any kind.  Any payment under the Plan shall be considered unique in nature and shall not create any rights to payments in future years.  
  (f)  No Right to Continued Service  .  Nothing in the Plan or in any Cash Retention Bonus Agreement granted under the Plan shall confer upon a Participant any right to continue in employment for  

any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company to terminate the employment of such Participant at any time and for any reason, with or without cause.  No Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Cash Retention Bonus and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Cash Retention Bonuses. 
  (g)  Restrictions on Transfer  .  No right to a Cash Retention Bonus (whether vested or unvested) or any other right under the Plan may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of to any third party except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
  (h)  Unsecured General Creditor  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Participants and any eligible beneficiary or estate, shall have only an unsecured, contractual right, and such right shall not be deemed superior to the right of any other creditor.  Any reserves that may be established by the Company in connection with Cash Retention Bonuses to be granted under this Plan shall be established in the Company s sole discretion and shall continue to be treated as the general assets of the Company. 
           8.

Exhibit 

VOCERA COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 
  2016 EQUITY INDUCEMENT PLAN  
    
  1.  PURPOSE  .  The purpose of this Plan is to provide incentives to attract, retain and motivate eligible persons whose contributions are important to the success of the Company, and any Parents and Subsidiaries that exist now or in the future, by offering them an opportunity to participate in the Company s future performance through the grant of Awards.  Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere in the text are defined in Section 17. 
  2.        SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN  .  
  2.1        Number of Shares Available  .   Subject to Sections 2.4 and any other applicable provisions hereof, the total number of Shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to this Plan is 292,725.  
  2.2        Lapsed, Returned Awards  .  Shares subject to Awards, and Shares issued under the Plan under any Award, will again be available for grant and issuance in connection with subsequent Awards under this Plan to the extent such Shares:  (a) are subject to Awards granted under this Plan that are forfeited; or (b) are subject to Awards granted under this Plan that otherwise terminate without such Shares being issued.  To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Shares used to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. 
  2.3        Minimum Share Reserve  .  At all times the Company shall reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares as shall be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Awards granted under this Plan.

If the number of outstanding Shares is changed by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, without consideration, then (a) the number of Shares reserved for issuance and future grant under the Plan set forth in Section 2.1, (b) the Exercise Prices of and number of Shares subject to outstanding Options and SARs, and (c) the number of Shares subject to other outstanding Awards, shall be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and in compliance with applicable securities laws; provided that fractions of a Share will not be issued. 
  3.        ELIGIBILITY  .  Awards may be granted only to persons who (a) are being hired by the Company or any Subsidiary as an Employee and such Award is a material inducement to such person being hired; (b) are being rehired following a bona fide period of interruption of employment with the Company or any Subsidiary; or (c) become an Employee of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with a merger or acquisition. 
  4.        ADMINISTRATION  .

   2 

5.        RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS  . 
  5.1        Awards of Restricted Stock Units  .  A Restricted Stock Unit (   RSU   ) is an award to a Participant covering a number of Shares that may be settled in cash, or by issuance of those Shares (which may consist of Restricted Stock).  All RSUs shall be made pursuant to an Award Agreement. 
  5.2        Terms of RSUs  .  The Committee will determine the terms of an RSU including, without limitation: (a) the number of Shares subject to the RSU; (b) the time or times during which the RSU may be settled; (c) the consideration to be distributed on settlement; and (d) the effect of the Participant s Termination on each RSU.  An RSU may be awarded upon satisfaction of such performance goals based on Performance Factors during any Performance Period as are set out in advance in the Participant s Award Agreement.  If the RSU is being earned upon satisfaction of Performance Factors, then the Committee will: (x) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the RSU; (y) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure the performance, if any; and (z) determine the number of Shares deemed subject to the RSU.  Performance Periods may overlap and participants may participate simultaneously with respect to RSUs that are subject to different Performance Periods and different performance goals and other criteria.   
  5.3        Form and Timing of Settlement  .  Payment of earned RSUs shall be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.

  6.1        Withholding Generally  .  Whenever Shares are to be issued in satisfaction of Awards granted under this Plan, the Company may require the Participant to remit to the Company, or to the Parent or Subsidiary employing the Participant, an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable U.S. federal, state, local and international withholding tax requirements or any other tax liability legally due from the Participant prior to the delivery of Shares pursuant to exercise or settlement of any Award.  Whenever payments in satisfaction of Awards granted under this Plan are to be made in cash, such payment will be net of an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable U.S. federal, state, local and international withholding tax requirements or any other tax liability legally due from the Participant. 
  6.2        Stock Withholding  .  The Committee, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time and to limitations of local law, may require or permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation or any other tax liability legally due from the Participant, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (i) paying cash, (ii) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the applicable withholding rate, or (iii) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the applicable withholding rate.

  7.        TRANSFERABILITY  .   
  7.1        Transfer Generally  .  Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will  
  
   3 

or by the laws of descent or distribution.  If the Committee makes an Award transferable, including, without limitation, by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the Awards are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor (settlor) or by gift to a Permitted Transferee, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. 
  7.2        Award Transfer Program  .  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, the Committee shall have all discretion and authority to determine and implement the terms and conditions of any Award Transfer Program instituted pursuant to this Section 7.2 and shall have the authority to amend the terms of any Award participating, or otherwise eligible to participate in, the Award Transfer Program, including (but not limited to) the authority to (i) amend (including to extend) the expiration date, post-termination exercise period and/or forfeiture conditions of any such Award, (ii) amend or remove any provisions of the Award relating to the Award holder s continued service to the Company, (iii) amend the permissible payment methods with respect to the exercise or purchase of any such Award, (iv) amend the adjustments to be implemented in the event of changes in the capitalization and other similar events with respect to such Award, and (v) make such other changes to the terms of such Award as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion. 
  8.        PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP; RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES  . 
  8.1        Voting and Dividends  .  No Participant will have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares until the Shares are issued to the Participant.

  9.        CERTIFICATES  .  All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under this Plan will be subject to such stock transfer orders, legends and other restrictions as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable, including restrictions under any applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign securities law, or any rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may be listed or quoted and any non-U.S. exchange controls or securities law restrictions to which the Shares are subject. 
  10.        SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  .  An Award will not be effective unless such Award is in compliance with all applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, as they are in effect on the date of grant of the Award and also on the date of exercise or other issuance.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Company will have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under this Plan prior to: (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable.  The Company will be under no obligation to register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company will have no liability for any inability or failure to do so. 
  11.        NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY  .  Nothing in this Plan or any Award granted under this Plan will confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company to terminate Participant s employment or other relationship at any time.

12.        CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS  . 
  12.1        Assumption or Replacement of Awards by Successor  .  In the event of a Corporate Transaction any or all outstanding Awards may be assumed or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption or replacement shall be binding on all Participants.  In the alternative, the successor corporation may substitute equivalent Awards or provide substantially similar consideration to Participants as was provided to stockholders (after taking into account the existing provisions of the Awards).  The successor corporation may also issue, in place of outstanding Shares of the Company held by the Participant, substantially similar shares or other property subject to repurchase restrictions no less favorable to the Participant.  In the event such successor or acquiring corporation (if any) refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, such Awards shall have their vesting accelerate as to all shares subject to such Award (and any applicable right of repurchase fully lapse) immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction.  In addition, in the event such successor or acquiring corporation (if any) refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction, the Committee will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that such Award will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and such Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  Awards need not be treated similarly in a Corporate Transaction.  
  13.        TERM OF PLAN/GOVERNING LAW  .  Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, this Plan will become effective on the Effective Date and will terminate ten (10) years from the date this Plan is adopted by the Board.  This Plan and all Awards granted hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding its conflict of law rules). 
  14.        AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN  .  The Board may at any time terminate or amend this Plan in any respect, including, without limitation, amendment of any form of Award Agreement or instrument to be executed pursuant to this Plan;   provided  ,   however  , that the Board will not, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, amend this Plan in any manner that requires such stockholder approval;   provided further  , that a Participant s Award shall be governed by the version of this Plan then in effect at the time such Award was granted. 
  15.        NONEXCLUSIVITY OF THE PLAN  .  Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor any provision of this Plan will be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such additional compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable. 
  16.        INSIDER TRADING POLICY  .  Each Participant who receives an Award shall comply with any policy adopted by the Company from time to time covering transactions in the Company s securities.

  1.  Settlement  .  Settlement of RSUs shall be made within the 30 days following the applicable date of vesting under the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice.  Settlement of RSUs shall be in Shares, unless otherwise provided in the Agreement or determined by the Committee in its discretion. 
  2.        No Stockholder Rights  .  Unless and until such time as Shares are issued in settlement of vested RSUs, Participant shall have no ownership of the Shares underlying the RSUs and shall have no right to dividends or to vote such Shares. 
  3.        Dividend Equivalents  .  Dividends, if any (whether in cash or Shares), shall not be credited to Participant. 
  4.        No Transfer  .  The RSUs and any interest therein shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
  5.        Termination  . 
  (a)        If Participant s service is Terminated for any reason, all unvested RSUs shall be forfeited to the Company forthwith, and all rights of Participant to such RSUs shall immediately terminate.   
  (b)        For purposes of the RSUs, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, Participant s status as a service provider will be considered Terminated as of the date Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary (regardless of the reason for the Termination and whether or not the Termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of the employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or engaged or the terms of Participant s employment or service agreement, if any) and, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Company, Participant s right to vest in the RSUs, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period or any period of  garden leave  or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or engaged or the terms of Participant s employment or service agreement, if any.   
  (c)        The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of the RSUs (including whether Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 
  6.        Section 409A  .  The RSUs are not intended to constitute  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (together with any U.S. Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the date hereof,    Section 409A   ).  However, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Agreement, if at any time the Committee determines that the RSUs (or any portion thereof) may be subject to Section 409A, the Committee shall have the right in its sole discretion (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify Participant or any other person for failure to do so) to adopt such amendments to the Plan or the Agreement, or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive  
  
   1 

effect), or take any other actions, as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate either for the RSUs to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. 
  7.        Responsibility for Taxes  . 
  (a)        Regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Parent or Subsidiary to which Participant provides service (the    Service Recipient   ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Participant s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant (   Tax-Related Items   ) is and remains Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount (if any) withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient.  Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including but not limited to the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs and the sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such vesting; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Participant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (or former Service Recipient, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  (b)        Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, Participant will pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Service Recipient to fulfill all obligations for Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items by any of the following or a combination thereof:

  (ii)    withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting of the RSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Participant s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent); 
    
  (iii)    withholding in Shares to be issued upon settlement of the RSUs (in which case Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items); and 
    
   (iv)    any other method acceptable to the Company and permitted under applicable laws. 
    
  Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable rates, including maximum withholding rates, in which case Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent amount in Shares. 
    
  (c)        The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

  (i)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from Termination of Participant s status as a service provider (regardless of the reason for the Termination and whether or not the Termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or engaged or the terms of Participant s employment or service agreement, if any); 
  (j)    the future value of the Shares underlying the RSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; and

  GLOBAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan, the Notice or the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, as applicable. 
    
  Terms and Conditions 
  This Appendix includes additional (or, if so indicated, different) terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to Participant if Participant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed herein. 
    
  If Participant is a citizen or resident of a country (or if Participant is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one in which Participant is currently residing and/or working, or Participant transfers to another country after being granted the RSUs, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company will, in its discretion, determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will be applicable to Participant. 
    
  Notifications 
  This Appendix also includes information regarding certain issues of which Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan.  The information is based on securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of July 2016.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, Participant should not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of Participant s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time the RSUs vest or Participant sells Shares acquired under the Plan. 
    
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to Participant s particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure Participant of a particular result.  Accordingly, Participant should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to Participant s individual situation. 
    
  Finally, if Participant is a citizen or resident of a country (or if Participant is considered as such for local law purposes) other than the one in which Participant is currently residing and/or working, or Participant transfers to another country after being granted the RSUs, the information contained herein may not be applicable in the same manner.

Participant further authorizes the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary to record such information and to keep such information in Participant s employee file. 
    
  Notifications 
    
  Securities Law Information  .  Participant is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes place outside Canada through facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed.

The RSUs must be reported, generally at nil cost, if the C$100,000 threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property held by Participant.  When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (   ACB   ) of the Shares, ordinarily equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if Participant owns Shares of the Company, the ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.

  UNITED KINGDOM 
    
  Terms and Conditions 
    
  Settlement  .      The following provisions supplement Section 1 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement: 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, including Section 9.3 of the Plan, the RSUs will be settled in Shares only, not cash.  This provision is without prejudice to the application of Section 7 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.   
  Responsibility for Taxes  .  The following provisions supplement Section 7 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement: 
    
  If payment or withholding of the income tax is due in connection with the RSUs and is not made within ninety days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Items occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the ITEPA 2003 (the    Due Date   ), the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a loan owed by Participant to the Service Recipient, effective on the Due Date.  Participant agrees that the loan will bear interest at then-current Official Rate of Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs (   HMRC   ), it will be immediately due and repayable, and the Company and/or the Service Recipient may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 8 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Participant is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), Participant will not be eligible for such a loan to cover the income tax due as described above.  In the event that Participant is a director or executive officer and the income tax is not collected from or paid by Participant by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to Participant on which additional income tax and National Insurance contributions (   NICs   ) may be payable.  Participant is responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying the Company or the Service Recipient (as applicable) for the value  
  
   10 

of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or the Service Recipient may recover at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 7 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. 
    
  Joint Election  .  As a condition of participation in the Plan, Participant agrees to accept any liability for secondary Class 1 NICs that may be payable by the Company or the Service Recipient (or any successor to the Company or the Service Recipient) in connection with the RSUs and any event giving rise to Tax-Related Items (the    Employer NICs   ).  Without prejudice to the foregoing, Participant agrees to execute a joint election with the Company and/or the Service Recipient (the    Joint Election   ), the form of such Joint Election being formally approved by HMRC, and any other consent or elections required by the Company or the Service Recipient in respect of the Employer NICs liability.  Participant further agrees to execute such other elections as may be required by any successor to the Company and/or the Service Recipient for the purpose of continuing the effectiveness of the Joint Election.  The Employer NICs may be collected by the Company and/or the Service Recipient using any of the means referred to in Section 7 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. 
    
  If Participant does not enter into the Joint Election, if approval of the Joint Election has been withdrawn by HMRC, if the Joint Election is revoked by the Company or the Service Recipient (as applicable), or if the Joint Election is jointly revoked by Participant and the Company or the Service Recipient (as applicable), the Company, in its sole discretion and without any liability to the Company or the Service Recipient, may choose not to issue or deliver any Shares or proceeds from the sale of Shares to Participant upon settlement of the RSUs.
