NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   

Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Ritter  or the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Los Angeles,
California. The Company was formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under the name Ritter Natural Sciences,
LLC, and converted into a Delaware corporation on September 16, 2008.  

Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops novel therapeutic products that modulate the human gut microbiome to treat gastrointestinal diseases.
The Company is advancing human gut health research by exploring the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota, and translating
the functionality of these microbiome modulators into safe and effective applications. The Company s lead drug candidate,
RP-G28, has the potential to become the first Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved drug for lactose intolerance,
a condition that affects more than one billion people worldwide.  

The
Company currently operates in one business segment focusing on the development and commercialization of RP-G28. The Company is
not organized by market and is managed and operated as one business. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision
maker, the Chief Executive Officer.  

Initial
Public Offering    

On
June 24, 2015, the Company s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-202924) relating to its initial public offering
of its common stock was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The shares began trading
on the NASDAQ Capital Market on June 24, 2015. The initial public offering closed on June 29, 2015, and 4,000,000 shares of common
stock were sold at an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share.  

The
Company paid to the underwriters underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1.6 million in connection with the offering.
In addition, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $1 million in connection with the offering. Thus, the net offering
proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $17.4
million.  

Capitalization    

In
connection with the Company s initial public offering in June 2015, the Company effected a 1 for 7.15 reverse
split of its common stock. All references to shares of common stock outstanding, average number of shares outstanding and per
share amounts in these financial statements and notes to financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split
on a retroactive basis.  

NOTE
2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s
financial position for the periods presented.  

The
accompanying interim period unaudited condensed financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with GAAP and applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2016,
the condensed statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed statements
of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited, but include all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments, which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position, operating
results and cash flows for the periods presented. The condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2016. The results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or any
other period.  

The
accompanying interim period unaudited condensed financial statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Going
Concern and Liquidity    

The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
not generated any product revenue and has not achieved profitable operations. At September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital
of approximately $4.9 million, an accumulated deficit of approximately $37.9 million, and cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$8.5 million. There is no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, and, if achieved, could be sustained on
a continuing basis. In addition, development activities, clinical and pre-clinical testing, and commercialization of the Company s
products will require significant financing. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern.  

Since
inception, the operations of the Company have been funded through the sale of common shares, preferred shares and convertible
debt. Management cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that
the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, the Company s stockholders may experience significant
dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could impact the Company s ability to
conduct business. If the Company is not able to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may
have to (i) significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of RP-G28 or some other future
product candidate; (ii) seek collaborators for RP-G28 or some other future product candidate at an earlier stage than otherwise
would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; (iii) relinquish or otherwise dispose
of rights to intellectual property, RP-G28 or other products that the Company may seek to develop or commercialize.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

There
have been no material changes in the Company s significant accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as compared with the significant accounting policies described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

Cash
consists of amounts held in a financial institution and consists of immediately available fund balances. The funds are maintained
at a stable financial institution, generally at amounts in excess of federally insured limits. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, approximately $8.2 million and approximately $15.6 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents were uninsured.
The Company has not experienced any loss on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date.

Clinical
Trial and Pre-Clinical Study Accruals     

The
Company makes estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements based on the facts and circumstances
known to it at that time. Accrued expenses for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are based on estimates of costs incurred
and fees that may be associated with services provided by contract research organizations, clinical trial investigational sites,
and other related vendors. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment
of patients, site initiation and the completion of milestones. In accruing service fees, management estimates the time period
over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, the Company obtains
information regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, the Company may be required to estimate
these services based on other information available to it. If the Company underestimates or overestimates the activity or fees
associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary
in future periods. Historically, estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in
estimates may result in a material change in the Company s accruals.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The provisions of ASU 2016-02 set out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract ( i.e.,  lessees and lessors). The new standard requires
lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or
not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is
recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required
to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their
classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for under the existing guidance for operating leases
today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous lease standard, Topic 840  Leases . The guidance is effective for annual periods
and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is effective for the Company for the year
ending December 31, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this standard will have on
the Company s financial statements.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). Among other things, ASU 2016-09 requires that entities
recognize excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee share-based payment transactions as income tax expense or benefit.
ASU 2016-09 also eliminates the requirement to reclassify excess tax benefits and deficiencies from operating activities to financing
activities in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the annual periods and interim periods within those annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have any impact on the
Company s financial statements.  

On
August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  a consensus
of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new guidance amends Accounting Standards
Codification No. 230 ( ASC 230 ) to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments
in the statement of cash flows. ASC 230 lacks consistent principles for evaluating the classification of cash payments and receipts
in the statement of cash flows. This has led to diversity in practice and, in certain circumstances, financial statement restatements.
Therefore, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-15 with the intent of reducing diversity in practice with respect to eight types
of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and
is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation
of this standard will have on the Company s financial statements.  

Other
accounting standards updates effective after September 30, 2016 are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

5   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

Master
Services Agreement    

On
December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Master Service Agreement with Covance, Inc. ( Covance ), with an effective
date of December 29, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Master Service Agreement, Covance (or one or more of its affiliates) will
provide Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 clinical services for a clinical study or studies to the Company, and, at the request of the Company,
assist with the design of such studies, in accordance with the terms of separate individual project agreements to be entered into
by the parties. The term of the agreement is for three years and will renew automatically for successive one year periods unless
Covance is no longer providing services under the agreement or either party has terminated the agreement upon written notice.
The Company may terminate the Master Service Agreement or any individual project agreement entered into under the Master Service
Agreement prior to the applicable study s completion at any time for any reason upon 30 days written notice to Covance,
except when the reason for termination is the safety of subjects, in which case it may be terminated immediately. Covance may
not terminate any individual project agreement without cause, except when the reason for the termination is the safety of subjects,
in which case it may be terminated immediately. In the event of a termination of the Master Service Agreement, Covance will be
entitled to full payment for (i) work performed on the applicable project through the date work on such project is concluded and
(ii) reimbursement for all non-cancellable and non-refundable expenses and financial obligations which Covance (or an affiliate)
has incurred or undertaken on behalf of the Company.  

Clinical
Supply and Cooperation Agreement with Ricerche Sperimentali Montale ( Ricerche ) and Inalco SpA ( Inalco )    

Effective
July 24, 2015, the Company entered into an amended Clinical Supply and Cooperation Agreement (the  Amended Supply Agreement )
with Ricerche and Inalco (collectively,  RSM ). The Amended Supply Agreement amends certain terms of the Clinical
Supply and Cooperation Agreement, dated December 16, 2009, amended on September 25, 2010 (the  Existing Supply Agreement ).  

Under
the Existing Supply Agreement, RSM granted the Company an exclusive worldwide option in a specified field and territory to assignment
of all right, title and interest to a purified Galacto-oligosaccharides product ( Improved GOS ), the composition
of matter of the Improved GOS and any information relating to the Improved GOS, including certain specified technical information
and other intellectual property rights (the  Improved GOS IP ). Pursuant to the amended terms, the Company could exercise
the option by paying RSM $800,000 within ten days after the effective date of the Amended Supply Agreement. The Company exercised
this option on July 30, 2015 and RSM transferred the Improved GOS IP to the Company. Under the terms of the Existing Supply Agreement,
if a further option payment of $1 million due in the future is not made, the Company may be required to return the Improved GOS
IP to RSM.  

RITTER
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.   

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
Amended Supply Agreement also provides that the Company must pay RSM $400,000 within 10 days following FDA approval of a new drug
application for the first product owned or controlled by the Company using Improved GOS as its active pharmaceutical ingredient.
In addition, the Company agreed to purchase 350 kilos of Improved GOS for the sum of $250 per kilo for clinical supply of Improved
GOS instead of $2,000 per kilo as under the Existing Supply Agreement.  

In
consideration for RSM entering into the Amended Supply Agreement, the Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the  RSM Shares ), to RSM on November 30, 2015. Fair value of these shares totaling $416,000 was
recognized in stockholders  equity in the Company s balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The stock purchase agreement
includes a lock-up agreement by RSM in favor of the Company pursuant to which RSM will not be allowed to sell the RSM Shares for
a period ending on the earlier of (i) the public release by the Company of the final results of its Phase 2b/3 clinical trial
of RP-G28 and (ii) the filing of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ) for the fiscal quarter in which the Company receives the results of its Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28.  

Lease
Agreement     

The
Company leases office space for its headquarters in California. Until September 30, 2015, the Company leased office and storage
space pursuant to a two-year agreement which called for a minimum monthly rental payment of approximately $5,000 with an annual
increase of 3%.  

On
July 9, 2015, the Company entered into a lease with Century Park, a California limited partnership, pursuant to which the Company
is leasing approximately 2,780 square feet of office space in Los Angeles, California for its headquarters. The lease provides
for a term of sixty-one (61) months, commencing on October 1, 2015. The Company paid no rent for the first month of the term and
will pay base rent of $9,174 per month for months 2 through 13 of the term, with increasing base rent for each twelve-month period
thereafter under the term of the lease to a maximum of $10,325 per month for months 50 through 61. The base rent payments do not
include the Company s proportionate share of any operating expenses, including real estate taxes. The Company has the option
to extend the term of the lease for one five-year term, provided that the rent would be subject to market adjustment at the beginning
of the renewal term.  

Rent
expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, was approximately $28,700 and $15,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $86,200 and $44,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements
of operations.  

Employment
Agreements    

Michael
D. Step   

On
December 2, 2014, Michael D. Step accepted an offer letter from the Company setting forth the terms of his employment as Chief
Executive Officer. The offer letter provides that Mr. Step is entitled to an annual base salary of $360,000 and a total of three
grants of options to purchase common stock of the Company.  

The
first two options entitle Mr. Step to purchase 646,537 and 73,377 shares of the Company s common stock, respectively, for
an exercise price of $5.86 per share. Each of these options was immediately exercisable in full as of the date of the grant,
with 44/48 ths  of the total number of shares covered by each option subject to a right of repurchase by the Company

loss from any claim or legal claim is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for
the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such
uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available,

Upon
the closing of the Company s initial public offering, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock and preferred
stock subject to redemption were converted into an aggregate of 3,322,652 shares of common stock. The following provides material
terms and certain historical information regarding the Series A-1, Series A-2, Series A-3, Series B and Series C Preferred Stock
prior to their conversion to common stock:  

Redemption.
 At any time after five years following the date of the initial issuance of the Series A-3, Series B, or Series C preferred
stock, as applicable, and at the option of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A-3, Series B, and
Series C preferred stock, voting together as a single class, the Company was required to redeem any outstanding shares that have
not been converted by paying cash in an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference of $0.62 and $1.30 for the Series
A-3 and Series C preferred stock, respectively, and $1.19 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, for the Series B preferred
stock. Given the holders  redemption option, the Series A-3, Series B, and Series C preferred stock is classified as preferred
stock subject to redemption in the accompanying balance sheets.  

Dividends.
 The holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock were entitled to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by the Company s
board of directors. The annual dividend rate was $0.00556 per share for the Series A-1 preferred stock, $0.032 per share for the
Series A-2 preferred stock, $0.04957 per share for the Series A-3 preferred stock, $0.09524 per share for the Series B preferred
stock, and $0.104 for Series C preferred stock (subject to adjustment). The right to receive dividends on shares of Series B preferred
stock was cumulative and the dividends accrue to holders of Series B preferred stock whether or not dividends are declared or
paid in a calendar year. Undeclared dividends in arrears for the Series B preferred stock was approximately $2 million as of June
29, 2015. The right to receive dividends on shares of Series A and Series C preferred stock was not cumulative and no right to
such dividends accrued to holders of Series A or Series C preferred stock.  

Liquidations .

C preferred stockholders were entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the sum of the original purchase price of $1.19
plus all cumulative but unpaid dividends for Series B, and $1.30 for Series C. If upon the liquidation, the available assets were
insufficient to permit payments to Series B and Series C holders, the entire assets legally available would have been distributable
on a pro rata basis among the holders in proportion to the full amounts they would have otherwise been entitled to receive. Upon
the completion of the distribution to the holders of the Series B and Series C preferred stock, the holders of the Series A preferred
stock would have been entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to
the holders of all other capital stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of the
original issue price per share of $0.07, $0.40, and $0.62 for Series A-1, Series A-2, and Series A-3 preferred stock, respectively,
plus any accrued but unpaid dividends on the preferred stock. Any remaining assets would have been distributed pro rata among
the preferred and common shareholders.

LLC ( KPT ) and Kolu Pohaku Management, LLC ( KPM ). The R D Agreement was subsequently amended on
July 6, 2011, September 30, 2011, February 6, 2012 and November 4, 2013 to increase the funding received by the Company.  

The
R D Agreement between the Company and KPM and KPT, a Qualified High Technology Business within the meaning of Hawaii Revised
Statutes, called for KPT to make a series of payments to the Company totaling $1,750,000 in exchange for the Company performing
research and development activities in Hawaii for the benefit of KPT (referred to herein as the KP Research). The KP Research
consisted of the initial phase of research, including the conduct of Phase II clinical trials in Hawaii for RP-G28. Pursuant to
the terms of the R D Agreement, the Company maintained ownership of the results of the Company s ongoing research related
to RP-G28, but KPT maintained ownership of the results of the KP Research. Inventions, developments and improvements arising out
of the KP Research were owned by KPT. Under the terms of the R D Agreement, the Company would bear any costs involved in obtaining
patents for any inventions, developments or improvements resulting from the Research Project. In exchange for the irrevocable,
perpetual, exclusive, worldwide right and license to the results of the KP Research, as they are generated under this R D
Agreement, the Company agreed to pay a quarterly royalty payment to KPT of $32,000 commencing March 31, 2015 and continuing through
December 31, 2035 or until such time as the KPM put or call option (as described below) was exercised. On March 26, 2015, the

to the terms of the KPM Option Agreement, the Company had the right to put 1,469,994 shares of the Company s Series B Preferred
Stock ( Series B ) to KPM and KPM had the option to call the same amount of shares of Series B from the Company at
any time after December 31, 2014. The number of shares was determined by dividing the $1,750,000 of payments made by KPT to the
Company under the R D Agreement by the Series B original issue price of $1.19. Exercise of the put or call option would result
in full satisfaction of the Company s obligation to make royalty payments to KPT under the R D Agreement and KPT s
right, title and interest in the research conducted pursuant to the R D Agreement would become the property of the Company.
On March 26, 2015, the Company exercised its right to the KPM put option and issued 1,469,994 shares of Series B preferred stock
to KPM. Pursuant to the terms of the KPM Option Agreement, this resulted in the full satisfaction of the Company s obligation
to make royalty payments to KPT under the R D Agreement and also resulted in the termination of the R D Agreement and
all of KPT s right, title and interest in and to the KP Research, which rights now belong to the Company.The Company converted
these shares into an aggregate of 205,593 shares of common stock upon the closing of its initial public offering.

The
Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these options for these services within general and administrative
expense in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of operations of approximately $333,000 and $752,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.0 and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $2.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period
of 1.2 years.  

On
October 25, 2016, the Company s board of directors granted 280,088 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
options, consisting of 140,044 options to each of Andrew J. Ritter, the Founder and President, and Ira E. Ritter, the
Executive Chairman and Chief Strategic Officer. The exercise price of these options is $2.60 per share, which reflects the
Company s closing price per share on October 25, 2016 (the date of grant). The options vest ratably over 48 months
beginning on the date that the Company discloses top-line data of its current phase 2b/3 clinical trial.  

Options
Issued to Nonemployees for Services Received   

The
Company has issued options to purchase an aggregate of 110,573 shares of the Company s common stock since inception to December
31, 2015 to non-employee consultants under the Plans. Of these, 74,687 options have been forfeited or exercised, and 35,886 options
remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of 7,000 non-qualified 10-year term options to purchase
shares of the Company s common stock to its nonemployee contractors and 15,908 options were forfeited or exercised. As of
September 30, 2016, a total of 26,978 options issued to nonemployees remain outstanding. The exercise prices of the outstanding
options, as determined by the Company s board of directors, range from $0.72 to $2.25 per share. These outstanding options,
with the exception of an option to purchase an aggregate of 7,272 shares granted to a consultant in March 2011, vest 25% upon
the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remaining options vesting monthly in equal amounts over 36 months.
The option granted to the consultant in March 2011, vested 25% on the date of grant with the remaining shares vesting monthly
in equal installments over 36 months.  

The
Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these options for these services of approximately $1,800 and $100
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $4,500 and $700 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, within research and development expense in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements
of operations.  

Options
Valuation   

The
Company calculates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and nonemployees using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing method. If the Company determines that other methods are more reasonable, or other methods for calculating these
assumptions are prescribed by regulators, the fair value calculated for the Company s stock options could change significantly.
Higher volatility and longer expected lives would result in an increase to stock-based compensation expense to non-employees determined
at the date of grant.  

Stock-based
compensation expense to non-employees affects the Company s research and development expenses.  

The
fair value of each stock option granted has been determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The material factors
incorporated in the Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair value of the options granted for the periods presented were as
follows:

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

(1)  
      During
    the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had no unvested options for non-employees and no new options were granted
    to employees or non-employees during the period.   

Expected
    dividend yield.  The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current
    plans to pay any dividends on the Company s common stock.   

Expected
    stock-price volatility.  As the Company s common stock only recently became publicly traded, the expected volatility
    is derived from the average historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within the Company s industry that
    the Company considers to be comparable to the Company s business over a period approximately equal to the expected term.   

Risk-free
    interest rate.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero
    coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.   

Expected
    term.  The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company s
    historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because
    of a lack of sufficient data. Therefore, the Company estimates the expected term by using the simplified method provided by
    the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life
    of the options.   

In
addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the Company also estimates a forfeiture rate to calculate
the stock-based compensation for the Company s equity awards. The Company will continue to use judgment in evaluating the
expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for the Company s stock-based compensation calculations
on a prospective basis.  

Management
estimated the implied market value of invested capital of the Company by backsolving for the purchase price of the Company s
preferred shares for one common share through the option-pricing method. The premise of this method is that the transaction implied
a market price for a share which in turn implied values for the other classes of equity based on relative claims on equity value,
such as liquidation preferences and conversion rights. The application of the backsolve method considering the Company s
capital structure yielded a total market value of invested capital of approximately $15.5 million, $14.4 million, and $8.9 million,
of which approximately $819,000, $870,000, and $670,000 were allocated to the total value of common stock as of the Company s
three valuation dates of November 7, 2013, July 31, 2012, and December 31, 2010, respectively.  

On
the three valuation dates of November 7, 2013, July 31, 2012, and December 31, 2010, after estimating the market value of invested
capital, the Company allocated it to the various equity classes comprising the subject company s capitalization table. This
process ultimately results in creating a final estimate of value for the subject company s underlying equity interests.
While there are many different value allocation methods, these various methods can be grouped into three general categories as
defined by the AICPA Guide, one of which is the Option-Pricing Method (OPM).  

RITTER
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.   

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
Company used the OPM to allocate market value of invested capital to the various equity classes and debt comprising the Company s
capitalization structure. The Company chose the OPM over other acceptable methods due to the complex capital structure, the uncertainty
related to market conditions, and the lack of visibility on an imminent exit event. Under the OPM, each equity class is modeled
as a call option with a distinct claim on the equity of the Company. The option s exercise price is based on the Company s
total equity value available for each participating equity holder. The characteristics of each equity class determine the equity
class  claim on the total equity value. By constructing a series of options in which the exercise price is set at incremental
levels of value, which correspond to the equity value necessary for each level of equity to participate, the Company determined
the incremental option value of each series. When multiplied by the percentage of ownership of each equity class participating
under that series, the result is the incremental value allocated to each class under that series.  

The
OPM relies on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the call options on the Company s invested capital. The following
inputs were applied in the Black-Scholes calculations of the OPM:  

Discounts
ranging from 35.8% to 40% were applied for lack of control and lack of marketability for the common stock. The calculation resulted
in a fair value for the common stock of $1.17, $1.19, and $1.03 per share as of the Company s three valuation dates
of November 7, 2013, July 31, 2012, and December 31, 2010, respectively.  

For
options issued in 2014, given the Company s distinct possible exit scenarios of an initial public offering, the Company
used the probability weighted expected return method (PWERM) to estimate the fair value of the Company s common equity.
Under this method, an analysis of future values of a company is performed for several likely liquidity scenarios. The value of
the common stock is determined for each scenario at the time of each future liquidity event and discounted back to the present
using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The present values of the common stock under each scenario are then weighted based on the
probability of each scenario occurring to determine the value for the common stock. The Company s management determined
the probability weighting of potential liquidity events to be 45% for an initial public offering and 55% for other scenarios,
which represents all other likely outcomes for the Company.  

Management
estimated the implied market value of invested capital of the Company by backsolving for the purchase price of the Company s
preferred shares for one common share through the use of OPM. The application of the backsolve method considering the capital
structure yielded a total market value of invested capital of approximately $25.2 million, of which approximately $1.4 million
was allocated to the total value of common stock as of the Company s valuation date of October 31, 2014.  

Given
the lack of marketability for the common stock, the Company applied a discount of 21.4% for using the average strike put option
approach. This resulted in a probability weighted common share value, after adjustment, of $5.86 per share as of valuation
date of October 31, 2014.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed financial statements and
related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) and the audited financial statements
and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 21, 2016 ( 2015 Annual Report ). As used in this report, unless
the context suggests otherwise,  we,   us,   our,  or  Ritter  refer to Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. All common share amounts and per share amounts in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect a
7.15-to-1 reverse stock split of our common stock.    

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data   

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than
statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations,
future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth
are forward-looking statements. The words  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate, 
 expect,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   predict, 
 project,   should,   target,   will,   would  and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements.  

Some
of the factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated or predicted include:  

our
    ability to obtain additional financing;   

the
    accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements;   

the
    success and timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;   

our
    ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for RP-G28 and any other product candidates we may develop, and the labeling
    under any approval we may obtain;   

regulatory
    developments in the United States and other countries;   

the
    performance of third-party manufacturers;   

our
    ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates;   

our
    ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates;   

the
    successful development of our sales and marketing capabilities;   

the
    potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets;   

the
    rate and degree of market acceptance of any future products;   

the
    success of competing drugs that are or become available; and   

the
    loss of key scientific or management personnel.   

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics,
and healthcare, regulatory and scientific developments and depend on the economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the
future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each
forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the
industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. In
addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we
operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, they may not be predictive of results
or developments in future periods.  

Any
forward-looking statement that we make in this Quarterly Report speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake
no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report. You should
also read carefully the factors described in the  Risk Factors  section of this Quarterly Report to better understand
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements.  

This
Quarterly Report includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research,
surveys and studies conducted by third-parties. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally
indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy
or completeness of such information. While we believe these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies
are reliable, we have not independently verified such data.  

Overview   

Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops novel therapeutic products that modulate the human gut microbiome to treat gastrointestinal diseases.
We are advancing human gut health research by exploring the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota and translating the functionality
of prebiotic-based therapeutics into applications intended to have a meaningful impact on a patient s health. We have completed
a Phase 2a clinical trial of our leading product candidate, RP-G28, an orally administered, high purity oligosaccharide.  

On
October 17, 2016, we announced that the last patient has completed dosing and all monitoring visits in our Phase 2b/3 clinical
trial of RP-G28 for the treatment of lactose intolerance. Topline results of the trial are expected to be announced in the first
quarter of 2017. The Phase 2b/3 trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm, multicenter study evaluating safety, efficacy
and tolerability of two dosing regimens of RP-G28 in patients with moderate to severe lactose intolerance symptoms. Enrollment
was initiated in March 2016 and completed in August 2016, achieving our projected enrollment time period. The study aims to evaluate
a patient s ability to consume dairy foods post-treatment with improved tolerance and reduced digestive symptoms. A total
of 377 subjects were enrolled in the trial with 18 clinical sites participating throughout the United States. Patients underwent
a 30-day treatment, followed by a 30-day post-treatment evaluation of dairy tolerance. A subset of subjects have been rolled into
a 12-month extension study to evaluate long-term durability of treatment. The study will also evaluate each participant s
microbiome, expanding knowledge of the effects that RP-G28 may have on adapting the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner.  

We
have had communications with the FDA regarding our clinical program and regulatory path towards getting our product adequately
studied and eventually approved. We intend to hold two meetings with the FDA in the near future about our Phase 2b/3 study, including
a Type C meeting as well as an End of Phase 2 meeting, both of which the FDA has encouraged us to schedule. These meetings and
communications are typical for development stage companies and include the clinical pathway, regulatory requirements, statistical
plan and endpoints and similar matters.  

We
have devoted substantially all of our resources to development efforts relating to RP-G28, including conducting clinical trials
of RP-G28, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We currently
do not have any products approved for sale and we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception.  

Prior
to our initial public offering in June 2015, we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of preferred stock,
common stock and promissory notes. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $17.4 million from our initial public offering
in June 2015, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  

We
have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately $10.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $37.9 million as of September 30, 2016. Substantially
all our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, stock-based compensation,
and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  

Financial
Overview   

Revenue    

We
have not generated any revenue since our inception. Our ability to generate revenue in the future will depend almost entirely
on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize RP-G28 in the United
States. In the event we choose to pursue a partnering arrangement to commercialize RP-G28 or other products outside the United
States, we would expect to initiate additional research and development and clinical trial activities in the future.  

Research
and Development Expenses    

Since
our inception, we have focused our resources on our research and development activities, including conducting nonclinical studies
and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for RP-G28. Our research and
development expenses consist primarily of:  

fees
    paid to consultants and clinical research organizations ( CROs ), including in connection with our nonclinical
    and clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory
    work, clinical trial database management, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis;   

costs
    related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;   

depreciation
    of equipment, computers and furniture and fixtures;   

costs
    related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and   

overhead
    expenses for personnel in research and development functions.   

From
inception through September 30, 2016, we have incurred approximately $13.1 million in research and development expenses. We plan
to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of RP-G28 for the
reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance in patients and other indications, subject to the availability of additional
funding.  

The
successful development of RP-G28 and any future product candidate is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate
the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of RP-G28 or to
develop any future product candidates or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from these product candidates
may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty
of:  

the
    scope, rate of progress and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical trials and other research and development
    activities;   

future
    clinical trial results; and   

the
    timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.   

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could mean a significant
change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory
authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion
of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials,
we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.  

Patent
Costs    

Patent
costs consist primarily of professional fees for legal services to prosecute patents and maintain patent rights.  

General
and Administrative Expenses    

General
and administrative expenses include allocation of facilities costs, salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees,
professional fees for directors, fees for independent contractors and accounting and legal services.  

We
expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to operate as a public company and will increase
further if RP-G28 is approved for commercialization. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director
and officer liability insurance, and increased fees for outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses.  

Interest
Income and Interest Expense    

Interest
income consists of interest earned on our cash.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates    

This
discussion and analysis is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments, research and development
costs, accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events
and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes in our significant
accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with the significant accounting policies
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating
our financial condition and results of operations.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

Fair
value measurement guidelines are prescribed by GAAP to value financial instruments. The guidance includes a definition of fair
value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair
value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.  

The
valuation techniques utilized are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained
from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. Assets are classified in their entirety
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

These
two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access
at the measurement date. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such
as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.  

Level
2   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly. Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models
consider various assumptions, including volatility factors, current market prices and contractual prices for the underlying financial
instruments. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or
are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  

Level
3   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their fair values
are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption
or input is unobservable.  

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
approximate the fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments.  

Research
and Development Costs    

We
expense the cost of research and development as incurred. Research and development expenses comprise costs incurred in performing
research and development activities, including clinical study costs, contracted services, and other external costs. Nonrefundable
advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the
activity is performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when payment is made, in accordance with ASC 730,  Research
and Development .  

Accrued
Expenses    

As
part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves
reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service
performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual
cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones
are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and
circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make
adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include fees due to service
providers.  

We
base our expenses on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with our service
providers that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation,
vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors
will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service
fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period.
If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status
and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us
reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.  

Stock-based
Compensation    

In
June 2015, we adopted a new equity incentive plan (the  2015 Plan ), to replace our prior 2008 Stock Plan and 2009
Stock Plan. Terms of our share-based compensation are governed by the 2015 Plan, 2009 Stock Plan and 2008 Stock Plan (collectively,
the  Plans ). The Plans permit us to grant non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options and other equity awards
to our employees, outside directors and consultants; however, incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Beginning
June 29, 2015, no further awards may be granted under the 2009 Stock Plan or 2008 Stock Plan. However, to the extent awards under
the 2008 Stock Plan or 2009 Stock Plan are forfeited or lapse unexercised or are settled in cash, the common stock subject to
such awards will be available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.  

On
June 3, 2016, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2015 Plan at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which among
other things, increased the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2015 Plan by 475,000 shares of common
stock. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, as
amended, was 389,448.  

The
exercise price for options issued under the 2015 Plan is determined by our board of directors, but will be (i) in the case of
an incentive stock option (A) granted to an employee who, at the time of grant of such option, is a 10% stockholder, no less than
110% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant; or (B) granted to any other employee, no less than 100% of the fair
market value per share on the date of grant; and (ii) in the case of a nonstatutory stock option, no less than 100% of the fair
market value per share on the date of grant. The options awarded under the Plans will vest as determined by our board of directors
but shall not exceed a ten-year period.  

Options
Issued to Directors and Employees as Compensation   

Pursuant
to the terms of the Plans, from inception to December 31, 2015, we issued options to purchase an aggregate of 2,026,712 shares
to our executive officers and employees and non-employee directors for their services on the board of directors and its committees.
Of these, 124,064 options were expired or exercised and 1,902,648 options remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The exercise
prices of these option grants, as determined by our board of directors, range from $0.79 to $13.23 per share, and a portion of
these vest subject to certain performance conditions.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we granted an aggregate of 246,000 non-qualified 10-year term options to purchase shares
of our common stock to our employees. Of these, 10,000 options were forfeited and a total of 2,158,648 options issued to executive
officers, non-executive employees and non-employee directors remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The exercise prices
of these option grants, as determined by our board of directors, range from $0.79 to $13.23 per share, and a portion of these
vest subject to certain performance conditions.  

We
recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these options for these services within general and administrative expense
in the unaudited condensed statements of operations in this Quarterly Report of approximately $333,000 and $752,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.0 and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $2.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period
of 1.2 years.  

On
October 25, 2016, our board of directors granted 280,088 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options, consisting
of 140,044 options to each of Andrew J. Ritter, our Founder and President, and Ira E. Ritter, our Executive Chairman and Chief
Strategic Officer. The exercise price of these options is $2.60 per share which reflects the Company s closing price per
share on October 25, 2016 (date of grant). The options vest ratably over 48 months beginning on the date that the Company dislcoses
top-line data of our current phase 2b/3 clinical trial.  

Options
Issued to Nonemployees for Services Received   

We
issued options to purchase an aggregate of 110,573 shares of our common stock since inception to December 31, 2015 to non-employee
consultants under the Plans. Of these, 74,687 options were forfeited or exercised, and 35,886 options remained outstanding as
of December 31, 2015.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we granted an aggregate of 7,000 non-qualified 10-year term options to purchase shares
of our common stock to our nonemployee contractors and 15,908 options were forfeited or exercised. As of September 30, 2016, a
total of 26,978 options issued to nonemployees remain outstanding. The exercise prices of the outstanding options, as determined
by our board of directors, range from $0.72 to $2.25 per share. These outstanding options, with the exception of an option to
purchase an aggregate of 7,272 shares granted to a consultant in March 2011, vest 25% upon the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date with the remaining options vesting monthly in equal amounts over 36 months. The option granted to the consultant
in March 2011, vested 25% on the date of grant with the remaining shares vesting monthly in equal installments over 36 months.  

We
recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these options for these services of approximately $1,800 and $100 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $4,500 and $700 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, within research and development expense in the unaudited condensed statements of operations in
this Quarterly Report.  

Options
Valuation   

We
calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and nonemployees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
method. If we determine that other methods are more reasonable, or other methods for calculating these assumptions are prescribed
by regulators, the fair value calculated for our stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected
lives would result in an increase to stock-based compensation expense to non-employees determined at the date of grant.  

Stock-based
compensation expense to non-employees affects our research and development expenses.  

The
fair value of each stock option granted has been determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The material factors
incorporated in the Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair value of the options granted for the periods presented were as
follows:  

(1)  
      During
    the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had no unvested options for non-employees and no new options were granted
    to employees or non-employees during the period.   

Expected
    dividend yield.  The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans
    to pay any dividends on our common stock.   

Expected
    stock-price volatility.  As our common stock only recently became publicly traded, the expected volatility is derived from
    the average historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to
    our business over a period approximately equal to the expected term.   

Risk-free
    interest rate.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero
    coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.   

Expected
    term.  The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Our historical
    share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because of a
    lack of sufficient data. Therefore, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method provided by the SEC. The
    simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.   

In
addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the
stock-based compensation for our equity awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected
terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act )   

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company  can
take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an  emerging growth company 
can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have
elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of
the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

We
are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the
JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an  emerging growth company,  we intend to rely
on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system
of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any
requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report
providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary
of the date we completed our initial public offering, which was June 29, 2015, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue
of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common
stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued
more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, together with the
changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses increased by approximately $0.8 million, or 56%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the three month ended September 30, 2015, due to the continuation of our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for RP-G28 that
was initiated in March 2016. The increase is attributable to $2.1 million in fees to our third-party clinical research organization,
which was partially offset by approximately $0.9 million in decreased manufacturing costs and an approximate $0.4 million decrease
for an out-sourced specific research project. The research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30,
2015 were in preparation for the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28.  

Patent
Costs   

The
approximate $51,000, or 108%, increase in patent costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same
period in 2015 was mainly due to overall timing of certain costs related to our maintenance of patent rights and the prosecution
of patents for an increased number of patents, the application for the issuance of patents as well as the preparation to file
national phase applications in certain foreign countries.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.5 million, or 30%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense. Approximately
$0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
approximately $0.8 million during the same 2015 period.  

Other
Income   

Other
income decreased by approximately $15,000, or 54% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 an approximate $9,600 gain on the settlement of an
accounts payable was recorded, and no such gain was recorded in the same current year period.  

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, together with the
changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:  

Research
and Development Expenses   

The
approximate $5.5 million, or 349%, increase in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly attributable to approximately $5.8 million in fees to our third-party
CRO and monitoring fees as part of our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for RP-G28 that was initiated in March 2016, partially offset
by a decrease in manufacturing and an out-sourced research project. The research and development expenses during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 were incurred in preparation of the phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28.  

Patent
Costs   

The
approximate $40,000, or 25%, increase in patent costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same
period in 2015 was primarily due to overall timing of certain costs related to our maintenance of patent rights, the prosecution
of patents for an increased number of patents and the application for the issuance of patents as well as the preparation to file
national phase applications in certain foreign countries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, three patents were
issued - U.S. Patent Nos. 9,200,303, 9,226,933 and 9,370,532.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.3 million, or 27%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.4
million, slightly offset by higher expenses of being a public company for the full nine months of 2016.  

Other
Income   

Interest
income increased by approximately $27,000, or 118%, during the nine month ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, due to interest earned on increased cash balances resulting from the net proceeds of our initial public
offering. Other income decreased by approximately $15,000, or 93%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same 2015 period as a result of gains on the settlement of accounts payable during the nine months ended September 30,
2015 that were not realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Since
our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations, and, as of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $37.9 million. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our
research and development programs, stock-based compensation, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had working capital of approximately $4.9 million, and cash of approximately $8.5 million. We have not
generated any product revenues and have not achieved profitable operations.  

Cash
Flows    

The
following table sets forth the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods set forth below:  

Operating
Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities of approximately $7.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects our net
loss of approximately $10.8 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation of approximately $1.0 million, an increase in
prepaid expenses of approximately $57,000, and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately
$2.1 million, $294,000 and $13,000, respectively.  

Net
cash used in operating activities of approximately $4.3 million during the nine months September 30, 2015 was primarily a result
of our net loss of approximately $6.6 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation of approximately $2.4 million, an
approximate increase in prepaid expenses of $251,000 and an approximate decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities of $247,000, $86,000 and $3,000, respectively.  

Investing
Activities   

Net
cash used in investing activities of approximately $8,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was related to the purchase
of office furniture and equipment.  

Financing
Activities   

Net
cash provided by financing activities of approximately $9,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from net
proceeds received from the exercise of options for common stock.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $17.8 million was attributable
to the net proceeds received upon closing of our initial public offering, selling 4 million shares of our common stock partially
offset by commissions and issuance costs of approximately $2.2 million.  

Sources
of Liquidity   

Aspire
Capital Financing Arrangement    

On
December 18, 2015, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the  Aspire Purchase Agreement ) with Aspire
Capital Fund, LLC ( Aspire Capital ), which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations
set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase from us up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of our shares of common
stock over the approximately 30-month term of the Aspire Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the Aspire Purchase Agreement,
we sold 500,000 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital at $2.00 per share for proceeds of $1.0 million. We may sell an additional
888,835 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital in the future pursuant to the terms of the Aspire Purchase Agreement.  

On
February 24, 2016, the conditions necessary for us to sell an additional 888,835 shares of our common stock to Aspire under the
Aspire Purchase Agreement were satisfied. On any trading day on which the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds $0.50,
we have the right, in our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a purchase notice (each a  Purchase Notice ),
directing Aspire Capital (as principal) to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock per trading day, for up to $9.0 million
of our common stock in the aggregate at a per share price (the  Purchase Price ), calculated by reference to the prevailing
market price of our common stock (as provided in the Aspire Purchase Agreement).  

In
addition, on any date on which we submit a Purchase Notice for 100,000 shares to Aspire Capital and the closing sale price of
our stock is equal to or greater than $0.50 per share of common stock, we also have the right, in our sole discretion, to present
Aspire Capital with a volume-weighted average price purchase notice (each a  VWAP Purchase Notice ), directing Aspire
Capital to purchase an amount of stock equal to up to 30% of the aggregate shares of our common stock traded on the Nasdaq Capital
Market on the next trading day, subject to a maximum number of shares we may determine, and a minimum trading price (as more specifically
described below). The purchase price per share pursuant to such VWAP Purchase Notice is calculated by reference to the prevailing
market price of our common stock (as provided in the Aspire Purchase Agreement).  

The
Aspire Purchase Agreement provides that we and Aspire Capital will not effect any sales under the Aspire Purchase Agreement on
any purchase date where the closing sale price of our common stock is less than $0.50 per share (the  Floor Price ).
This Floor Price and the respective prices and share numbers in the preceding paragraphs will be appropriately adjusted for any
reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction. There are
no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount
of any sales of our common stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to
make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial
or business covenants, restrictions on future fundings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated
damages in the Aspire Purchase Agreement. Aspire Capital may not assign its rights or obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or cost to us.  

We
expect to use the Aspire Capital facility to complement, rather than replace, other financing that may be required during the
next twelve months to continue our operations and support our capital needs.  

October
2016 Public Offering    

On
October 31, 2016, we closed a public offering of 2,127,660 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $2.35 per share,
for net proceeds of approximately $4.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable
by us in the offering. The offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Number 333-213087)
We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase from us up to an additional 212,766 shares of common stock to cover
over-allotments, if any. If the underwriters exercise their option in full, the total net proceeds to us will be approximately
$4.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses payable by us.  

Future
Funding Requirements    

To
date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not
expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize
RP-G28 or any of our other product candidates. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing
development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval
for, our product candidates. Additionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating
as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will
need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.  

Based
upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest and any proceeds
received from our recent public offering in addition to the sale of shares of common stock to Aspire Capital in the future pursuant
to the Aspire Purchase Agreement, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the
first quarter of 2017. We intend to devote our existing financial resources to fund the continued clinical development of RP-G28
for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance, including our anticipated Phase 2b/3 trials; to fund expenses
associated with the manufacture and product development of RP-G28; to explore potential orphan indications; and for general corporate
purposes, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital and prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual
property.  

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including without limitations the progress, costs, results of and timing
of completing our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and extension study for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance
in patients and the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA, EMA and any other regulatory approvals.  

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination
of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements
and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the
terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.
Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through
government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic
alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future
revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.  

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments   

There
have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

Through
September 30, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information
required by Item 3.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  

Based
on our evaluation, we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a controls system, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our third fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

The
Company is not currently involved in any legal matters arising in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company
could become involved in disputes and various litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. These may include
disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, licensing, contract law and employee relations matters.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

The
risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2015 Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in our 2015 Annual Report do not identify all risks that we face
because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently
consider to be immaterial to our operations. No material change in the risk factors discussed in our 2015 Annual Report has occurred.

Use
of Proceeds    

On
June 24, 2015, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-202924) relating to our initial public offering of our common
stock was declared effective by the SEC. Our initial public offering closed on June 29, 2015, and 4,000,000 shares of our common
stock were sold at an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to us of $20 million and
net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, of approximately $17.4 million.  

As
of September 30, 2016, proceeds from the initial public offering have been used to fund our Phase 2b/3 trials and product development,
including a $0.8 million payment to exercise an option with a research and development supplier and payment of approximately $5.8
million to our CRO, pursuant to a master services agreement. A portion of the proceeds ($227,250) was used to pay the annual bonuses
earned by Andrew and Ira Ritter for 2015, based upon the achievement of specific performance goals, pursuant to the terms of their
respective offer letters. Remaining proceeds from the initial public offering are expected to be spent to support continued research
and development efforts, general corporate purposes, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital
and prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property.
