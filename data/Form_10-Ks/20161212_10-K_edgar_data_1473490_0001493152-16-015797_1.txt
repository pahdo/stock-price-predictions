HISTORY
OF WALL-STREET.COM   

Since
1984, Wall-Street.com, through its predecessor company, performed an exclusive investor relations (IR) service for a very select
and limited group of some of the largest and best-known companies on Wall Street through its  Fastest-Growing Companies ,
 Shareholder Friendly Companies  and  Exceptional Companies  investor relations programs. Wall-Street.com
IR Programs have been so well received by IR and Wall Street professionals that most Programs became  oversubscribed 
shortly after becoming available. Some of Wall-Street.com s best-know larger alumni include Amgen, Applied Materials, Biogen,
BMC Software, Cooper Companies, Genentech, General Dynamics, Medtronic, Motorola, Raymond James Financial and Rent-A-Center.  

Ten
years later, in 1994, Wall-Street.com s predecessor established one of the very first financial websites on the Internet
and has operated continually since then under the registered trademark name, Wall-Street.com. During this time, it dramatically
increased its coverage of microcap companies.  

Consulting
Services . Beginning in the first Quarter of the 2016 fiscal year the Company ceased all of its internet and IT services and
began exclusively providing consulting services. These services consist of general business and financial services and are provided
to existing clients of Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS    

An
investment in our common stock is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and should be made only by investors who
can afford a complete loss. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information in this
10-K filing, including our financial statements and the related notes, before you decide to buy our common stock. If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected,
the trading of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment therein.  

Risks
Relating to the Early Stage of our Company   

We
are at a very early operational stage and our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new
business venture and 100% of revenues are from a related party.    

The
implementation of our business strategy, particularly our consulting service business, is in a very early stage. Our business
and operations should be considered to be in a very early stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business venture. Accordingly, our intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future,
if at all. Any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many factors, several of which may be beyond our control, or
which cannot be predicted at this time, and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business
prospects and operations and the value of an investment in our Company.  

We
have a very limited operating history and our business plan is unproven and may not be successful.    

Our
Company was formed in January 2009 and we have recently transitioned to a consulting services focus. We have not provided, licensed
or sold any substantial amount of services and do not have any definitive agreements to do so. We have not proven that our business
model will allow us to generate a profit. One hundred percent of our revenues were derived from Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).  

We
have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability.    

We
had an accumulated deficit of $1,428,035 as of September 30, 2016 and we expect to continue to incur significant developmental
expenses in the foreseeable future related to our transition to, and development of, our consulting services business. As a result,
we are sustaining substantial operating and net losses, and it is possible that we will never be able to sustain or develop the
revenue levels necessary to attain profitability.  

We
may have difficulty raising additional capital, which could deprive us of necessary resources.    

In
order to support the initiatives envisioned in our business plan, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private
debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. Our ability to raise additional financing depends
on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets, the market price of our common stock and the development
or prospects for development of competitive technology by others. Because our common stock is not listed on a major stock market,
many investors may not be willing or allowed to purchase it or may demand steep discounts. Sufficient additional financing may
not be available to us or may be available only on terms that would result in further dilution to the current owners of our common
stock.  

We
expect to raise additional capital during Fiscal Year Ending 2017 but we do not have any firm commitments for funding. If we are
unsuccessful in raising additional capital, or the terms of raising such capital are unacceptable, we may have to modify our business
plan and/or significantly curtail our planned activities and other operations.  

There
are substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business, our shares
may have little or no value.    

The
Company s ability to become a profitable operating company is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and/or obtain
financing adequate to support our cost structure. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or financing. These
factors have raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to attempt to raise additional
equity capital by selling shares through one or more private placement or public offerings. However, the doubts raised, relating
to our ability to continue as a going concern, may make our shares an unattractive investment for potential investors. These factors,
among others, may make it difficult to raise any additional capital.  

Failure
to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely
affect our business and operating results.    

Should
the Company develop another subsidiary and if the business of the subsidiary grows, we will be required to manage multiple relationships.
Any growth by us or our subsidiary, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships will increase this strain on our
managerial, operational and financial resources. This strain may inhibit our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary
to implement our business plan, and could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business prospects and
operations and the value of an investment in our Company.  

Risks
Relating to Our Business   

We
will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our consulting services to generate revenues and achieve profitability.    

We
may not successfully develop successful relationships with potential clients, and even if we do, we may not do so on a timely
basis. We cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for our consulting services will develop, if at all, and
we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market. If markets fail to accept consulting services, we
may not be able to generate revenues from the provision of such services. Our revenue growth and achievement of profitability
will depend substantially on our ability to introduce services that are accepted by customers. If we are unable to cost-effectively
achieve acceptance of our services by customers, or if the associated services do not achieve wide market acceptance, our business
will be materially and adversely affected.  

We
will need to establish additional relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our services.    

We
do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize consulting services on a mass scale. Unless we expand
our development capacity and enhance our internal marketing, we will need to make appropriate arrangements with collaborative
affiliates to develop and commercialize consulting services and products.  

Collaborations
may allow us to:  

generate
    cash flow and revenue;   

offset
    some of the costs associated with our internal development; and   

successfully
    commercialize consulting services and products.   

If
we need, but do not find appropriate affiliate arrangements, our ability to develop and commercialize consulting services and
products could be adversely affected. Even if we are able to find collaborative partners, the overall success of the development
and commercialization of our services and products will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control.
In addition, in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration, there are a variety of attendant technical,
business and legal risks, including:  

a
development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information and knowledge, potentially enabling the partner to
develop services and products without us or design around our intellectual property;  

We
may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development
or commercialization of services and products, or to their marketing and distribution; and  

Disputes
may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of
our services and products or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources.  

The
occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition.  

We
may not be successful at marketing our consulting services or products.    

We
may not be able to market our services or products, or efforts we exert to develop, commercialize or promote such services and
products may not result in revenue or earnings.  

We
may lose out to larger and better-established competitors.    

The
consulting services industry is intensely competitive. Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical,
marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. Our services may not be competitive
with their services. If this happens, our sales and revenues will decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors
may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition
may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.  

Risks
Relating to our Stock   

We
have no firm commitments to purchase any substantial amount of shares.    

We
have no firm commitment for the purchase of any large quantities of shares. Therefore there is no assurance that a trading market
will develop or be sustained. The Company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares. The Company
may be unable to identify investors to purchase the shares and may have inadequate capital to support its ongoing business obligations.  

All
proceeds from the sale of shares offered by the Company will be and have been immediately available for use by the Company.    

All
proceeds from the sale of shares to date, offered by the Company, have been and will continue to be available for immediate use
by the Company. The proceeds of the sale may not be sufficient to implement the Company s business strategy.  

The
sale of the shares of common stock acquired in private placements could cause the price of our common stock to decline.    

During
2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 we completed financings in which we issued common stock to certain private investors. The investors
may resell to the public the common stock acquired in these transactions.  

The
selling stockholders may sell none, some, or all of the shares of common stock acquired from us. We have no way of knowing whether
or when the selling stockholders will sell the shares. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, a sale of these shares could
cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or anticipation
of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at
a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.  

Currently,
our shares are traded on the OTC.QB under the symbol of WSCO.  

A
low market price would severely limit the potential market for our common stock.    

Our
common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below $5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC
rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers. These rules generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has
a market price share of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions (a  penny stock ). Such rules require
the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated
therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established
customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability
determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale.
The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny
stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s
presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written
confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny
stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers
by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock.  

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock.    

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, FINRA
rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker -dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that
the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax
status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high
probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it
more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and
sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares.  

An
investor s ability to trade our common stock may be limited by trading volume.    

A
consistently active trading market for our common stock may not occur on the OTCQB. A limited trading volume may prevent our shareholders
from selling shares at such times or in such amounts as they may otherwise desire. The Company s shares are currently traded
on the OTC.QB under the symbol WSCO.  

Our
Company has a concentration of stock ownership and control, which may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a
change of control.    

Our
common stock ownership is highly concentrated. Through ownership of shares of our common stock, one shareholder, John Moroney,
beneficially owns 60% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the concentrated ownership of the stock,
this stockholder, acting alone, will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect
of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company. It could also deprive our stockholders of an opportunity
to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our Company and it may affect the market price of our common stock.  

We
have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited
protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.    

Federal
legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed
to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response
to legal requirements; others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges,
such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that
are required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ, are those that address the board of Directors independence,
audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. While our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct, we have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures, and since our securities are not listed
on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all
of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions
were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example,
in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions
concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees, may be made
by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear
in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.  

Because
we will not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, stockholders will only benefit from owning common stock if it appreciates.    

We
have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any
future earnings to finance our growth. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from
his investment should not purchase our common stock.

OVERVIEW   

Wall
Street Media Company, Inc. ( Wall Street Media ,  Company   we   us   our )
was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com, Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 6, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its
name to My Catalogs Online, Inc., and again in November 2012 to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. and in August 2013 to Wall Street
Media Company, Inc. The Company maintains the web domain of Mycatalogsonline.com, but does no business under that name.  

The
Company formerly owned 100% of the outstanding common stock of Catalog Enterprises, Inc. which was formed in March 2009, for the
purpose of acquiring and maintaining domain names for future. Catalogs Enterprises was formally dissolved with the Secretary of
the State of Florida in 2013 and all stock shares were cancelled.  

Consulting
Services    

Over
the past fiscal year, the Company s operations have transitioned from website development services to consulting services.
We have ceased pursuing website development as a business,  

In
the past year and in the upcoming year we plan to focus on our consulting services, which we provide to various businesses, currently
concentrated in the medical industry. These consulting services consist of general business advice as well as website and related
internet development of the companies and their related brands and online presence, including social media platform development,
content and content management.  

During
the course of 2016, our Acting President contacted and developed relationships in the medical business for the purpose of providing
consulting services to these companies. One hundred percent of the revenues were derived from Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   

In
response to the SEC s financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting
Policies, the Company has selected its more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology
used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects
on the Company s financial condition. These accounting estimates are discussed below. These estimates involve certain assumptions
that if incorrect could create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.  

Revenue
Recognition    

Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, economic
risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and any future
obligations of the Company are insignificant.  

Revenue
is derived from consulting services:  

Consulting
    Services : The Company provides consisting services to as described above. Revenue for these services is recognized when
    rendered.    

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenue:
 The Company s revenues decreased approximately 10% from $45,430 during the year ended September 30, 2015 to $40,800
for the year ended September 30, 2016 due to a decrease in website development services.  

Operating
Expenses:  The Company s operating expenses increased approximately 1% from $94,498 during the year ended September 30,
2015 to $95,146 for the year ended September 30, 2016. The primary reason for this was due to the increase in professional fees
offset by a decrease in salaries and website expenses.  

Interest
Expense:  The Company s interest expense increased approximately 137% from $1,390 during the year ended September 30,
2015 as compared to $3,298 for the year ended September 30, 2016 due to the issuances of notes payable during the year.  

The
Company s net loss from operations increased approximately 11% from $49,062 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared
to $54,346 for the year ended September 30, 2016. The primary reason for this was due to the decrease in revenue. One hundred
percent of the revenues were derived from Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Net
cash used in operating activities was $50,325 for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $64,375 for the year
ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $49,890 for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $63,900 for the
year ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to issuances of notes payable.  

As
of October 4, 2016, the Company had approximately $420 in cash. The Company plans to fund ongoing operations by continuing to
pursue contracts to provide consulting services in efforts to generate additional revenue. In addition, the Company is actively
seeking investor funding.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

To
the Board of Directors of 

 Wall
Street Media Co., Inc. 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wall Street Media Co., Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. Wall Street Media Co., Inc. s
management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audit. 

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wall
Street Media Co., Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, the Company has incurred operating losses, has incurred negative cash flows from operations and has a working capital
deficit. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note
1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Nature
of Operations    

Wall
Street Media Co, Inc. and Subsidiary (the  Company ) was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com, Inc. in the state of Nevada
on January 26, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its name to My Catalogs Online, Inc. In August, 2013 the Company changed
its name to Wall Street Media Co, Inc.  

Wall
Street Media is situated within the consulting services sector, and looks to expand its services to companies of the utmost quality.
Wall Street Media chooses to implement its efforts within the consulting sector because of the need for quality evaluation of
the growing start-up marketplace. The Company now has the means to detect and attain the best companies with the most beneficial
services to be provided.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company believes that
the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which it relies are reasonable based upon information available at the time that
these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the periods presented. The financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between
these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated
by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s
judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. Significant estimates include
the valuation of equity based transactions and related services, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.  

Revenue
Recognition    

In
accordance with ASC 605-10, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to
and accepted by the customer, economic risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection
is reasonably assured, and any future obligations of the Company are insignificant. These criteria are generally met during the
period when the development or consulting services are provided or completed.  

Advertising   

The
Company may conducts advertising for the promotion of its products and services. In accordance with ASC 720-35, advertising costs
are charged to operations when incurred; such amounts aggregated $0 in 2016 and $25 in 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10  Accounting for Income Taxes,  which requires,
among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.  

Upon
inception, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions . In accordance
with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during
which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated
with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount
of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The
portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected
as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties
that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain
of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of September
30, 2016, tax years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit
from the Internal Revenue Service for any of the open tax years.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share   

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities
consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock options and convertible
debt instruments. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were
no potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company does not believe these are any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.  

Note
2 - Going Concern   

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported net losses
of $37,519 and $50,458, respectively, and used cash for operating activities of $50,325 and $64,375 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In addition, the Company has a working capital deficit of $102,098 at September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to implement its business plan and continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is actively seeking investor funding.  

Note
3     Related Party Transactions    

$40,800,
and $40,000, or 100 % and 88%, of the Company s revenue during the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
was derived from related parties where the customers were commonly controlled by our former officers and current majority shareholder.  

In
November 2014,   January  2015,
April 2015 and August 2015 the Company received $20,000, $20,000, $10,000 and $10,000 respectively, from the issuance of notes
payable that accrue interest at an annual rate of 4%, and are payable on demand. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016
Company received an additional $28,890 increasing the balance on the notes to $93,790 as of September 30, 2016 payable on demand
at an interest rate of 4% annually.   

Jeffrey
A. Lubchansky who is currently acting CEO, CFO   President received $27,500 during the year ended September 30, 2016. His
compensation is $2,500 per month plus out-of-pocket expenses. A 1099 was issued to Mr. Lubchansky.  

Note
4   Stockholders  Deficit    

The
Company has 5,000,000 preferred shares authorized. None are designated, issued or outstanding.  

Conversion
of Related Party Debt to Common Stock and Capital Contributions    

During
the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued a stockholder and former officer 100,000 shares of common stock in settlement
of deferred salary totaling $112,800, which was recorded based on the value of the services provided.  

Note
5   Notes Payable- related parties   

In
November 2014,   January  2015,
April 2015 and August 2015 the Company received $20,000, $20,000, $10,000 and $10,000 respectively, from the issuance of notes
payable that accrue interest at an annual rate of 4%, and are payable on demand. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016
Company received an additional $28,890 increasing the balance on the notes to $93,790 as of September 30, 2016 including the assumption
of the stockholder s note mentioned below.   

During
the year ended September 30, 2015, a stockholder and former officer advanced $3,800 to the Company for working capital purposes.
The advance was assigned to Landmark-Pegasus (a related party) by the stockholder and former officer in payment of an amount due
to Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).  

Note
6   Income Taxes   

There
was no income tax expense in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to the Company s net taxable losses.  

The
reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 computed at the United States federal
tax rate of 34% to income tax expense (benefit) is as follows:  

The
tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets is as follows:  

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. At September 30, 2016 the Company has net operating losses (NOL)
of approximately $664,000 that will expire from 2034 to 2035. In the event that a significant change in ownership of the
Company occurs as a result of the Company s issuance of common stock, the utilization of the NOL carry forward will be subject
to limitation under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Management does not presently believe that such a change
has occurred.  

A
valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established at September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the full amount of our deferred tax assets
due to the uncertainty of realization. Management believes that based upon its projection of future taxable operating income for
the foreseeable future, it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax
assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015. The valuation allowance as of September 30, 2016 was $ (251,958) . The net change in the

ITEM
9. CHANGES AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE    

None.  

Item
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Not
applicable.  

Disclosure
Controls    

We
carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e).
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed in
an issuer s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our objectives and processes and effect on the information
generated for use in this report. This type of evaluation is done quarterly so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness
of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. We intend to maintain these controls as processes
that may be appropriately modified as circumstances warrant.  

Based
on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective in timely alerting them to material information which is required to be included in our periodic reports filed
with the SEC as of the end of the period covering this report.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in
Internal Control   Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective as of September 30, 2016.  

However,
a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the inherent
limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.  

This
report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we engaged our independent registered public accounting firm
to perform, an audit on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this report.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

During
our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
