1. B    asis of Presentation and Business Description 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WWE.   WWE  refers to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.  References to  we,   us,   our  a  nd the  Company  refer to WWE.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense  s during the reporting period.    Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The accompanying consolidated finan  cial statements are unaudited.   All adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at the dates and for the periods   presented have been included.

Recent Accounting Pronouncement  s 

In   August   2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Stan  dards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15  ,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,    which addresses eight specific cash flow issues and is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments in the ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, th  e FASB   issue  d    ASU     No. 2016-09,    Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ,       which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The amendments require entities to record all excess tax benefits or deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and would require entities to classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will also allow entities to provide net settlement of stock-based awards to cover tax withholding obligations without classifying the awards as a liability as long as the net settlement does not exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate. The amounts paid to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation would be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the amendments allow entities to elect an accounting policy to either continue to use a forfeiture estimate on share based awards or account for forfeitures when they occur. The new guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,    Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   . The amendments eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when a change in ownership occurs. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investment and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard and do  es   not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842)  ,      which will supersede the existing guidance for lease accounting. This new standard will require lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. The new standard requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  An entity will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,    Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ,      which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting). Under the new guidance, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available-for-sale in other comprehensive income, and they will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. However, entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. The guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans is not impacted The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company is effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,    Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ,  which requires all inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory that is accounted for using the LIFO or the retail inventory method, which will be measured under existing accounting standards. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ." This standard will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, "  Revenue Recognition  ," and most industry-specific guidance. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services. In addition, during 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Principle versus Agent Considerations  ,  ASU No. 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  and ASU No. 2016-12,    Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ,  all of which clarify certain implementation guidance in ASU No. 2014-09.  This standard along with the subsequent clarifications issued are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, making it effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard allows an entity to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this new standard, along with subsequent clarifying guidance, on our consolidated financial statements. 

3. Segment Information 

T  he   Company currently classifies its operations into   ten   reportable segments.  The ten reportable segments of the Company include the following: Network (which includes our pay-per-view business), Television, Home Entertainment and Digital Media, which are individual segments that comprise the Media Division; Live Events  ; Licensing, Venue Merchandise and   WWEShop, which are individual segments that comprise the Consumer Products Division; WWE Studios, and Corporate and Other (as defined below).  

The Company presents OIBDA as the primary measure of segment profit (loss).  The Company defines OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding feature film and television production asset amortization and impairments, as well as the amortization of costs related to content delivery and technology assets   utilized for our WWE Network.    The Company believes the presentation of OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view our segment performance in the same manner as the primary method used by management to evaluate segment performance and make decis  ions about allocating resources.  Additionally, we believe that OIBDA provides a meaningful representation of operating cash flows within our segments.

OIBDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and may be different than similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A limitation of OIBDA is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic charge for certain fixed assets and intangible assets used in generating revenues for our business. OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance, or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA. See below for a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income for the periods presented. 

We   record   certain costs   within   our Corporate and Other segment   since the costs benefit the Company as a whole and are not directly attributable to our other reportable segments. These costs are categorized and presented into two categories, Corporate Support and Business Support.   Corporate   Support expenses primarily include our   corporate   general and administrative functions. Business Support expenses include our   sales and marketing   functions  , our international   sales   offices, talent development   costs  , including costs associated with our WWE Performance Center  , and our business strategy and data analytics functions  .    Included in Corporate and Other are intersegment eliminations recorded in consolidation. 

We do not disclose   assets by segment information.   In general, assets of the Company are leveraged across its reportable segments and we do not provide assets by segment information to our chief operating decision maker, as that information is not typically used in the determination of resource allocation and assessing business performance of each reportable segment.

The following tables present summarized financial information for each of the Company's reportable segments: 

(1) 

Beginning on January 1, 2016, the Company started allocating certain shared costs and expenses between our Network and Television segments  , with further refinements to the methodology implemented during the third quarter of 2016  .    We   believe this allocation more accurately reflects the operations of each of these reportable segments.  The impact of this allocation methodology during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     was a decline   to Network segment OIBDA of approximately   $  3,2  48   and   $  11,6  45  , respectively, with a corresponding increase of   $  3,2  48   and   $  11,6  45  , respectively, to Television segment OIBDA.  The allocation methodology had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Prior year Network   and Television segment results were not revised for this prospective change in the allocation method.

5. Stock-  b  ased Compensation 

2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan 

Our 2007 Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) provides for equity-based incentive awards as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors as incentives and rewards to encourage officers and employees to participate in our long-term success. 

2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan      

The Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ) on February 3, 2016, and April 21, 2016, respectively. A total of   5,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan.  Beginning on February 3, 2016, the 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan, and no new awards will be granted under the 2007 Plan.  Any awards outstanding under the 2007 Plan on the date of stockholder approval of the 2016 Plan will remain subject to and be paid under the 2007 Plan, and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan that subsequently cease to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of settlement of the awards in shares) will automatically become available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards, and performance awards to eligible participants as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Awards may be granted under the 2016 Plan to o  fficers, employees, consultants,   advisors   and independent contractors   of the Company and its affiliates and to non-employee directors of the Company.  

Restricted Stock Units 

The Company grants restricted stock units ("RSUs") to officers and employees under the   2016 Plan.   Stock-based compensation costs associated with our RSUs are determined using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant.  These costs are recognized over the requisite service period using the graded vesting method, net of estimated forfeitures.  RSUs have a service requirement typically over a   three   and one half year vesting schedule and vest in equal annual installments.  We estimate forfeitures based on historical trends when recognizing compensation expense and adjust the estimate of forfeitures when they are expected to differ or as forfeitures occur. Unvested RSUs accrue dividend equivalents at the same rate as are paid on our shares of Class A common stock.  The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs. 

The following table summarizes the RSU activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Performance Stock Units 

The Company grants performance stock units ( PSUs ) to officers and employees under the 2016 Plan.   Stock-based compensation costs associated with our PSUs     are initially determined using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the awards are approved by our Compensation Committee (service inception date).  The vesting of these PSUs are subject to certain performance conditions and a service requirement of   typically   three   and one half years.  Until such time as the performance conditions are met, stock compensation costs associated with these PSUs are re-measured each reporting period based upon the fair market value of the Company's common stock and the probability of attainment on the reporting date.  The ultimate number of PSUs that are issued to an employee is the result of the actual performance of the Company at the end of the performance period compared to the performance conditions.  Stock compensation costs for our PSUs are recognized over the requisite service period using the graded vesting method,   net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on historical trends which recognizing compensation expense and adjust the estimate of forfeitures when they are expected to differ or as forfeitures occur.    Unvested PSUs

accrue dividend equivalents once the performance conditions are met at the same rate as are paid on our shares of Class A common stock.  The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying PSUs. 

During the first quarter of 2015, the Compensation Committee approved agreements to grant PSUs to   three   executive management members for an aggregate value of   $15,000  .  These awards vary from the typical PSU grant in that the awards vest in   three   annual tranches of   20%  ,    30%  , and   50%  , compared to the typical 33%, 33%, 33% vesting schedule.  These agreements provide for   two     $7,500   awards, the first with performance conditions tied to 2015 results, and the second with performance conditions tied to 2016 results. The Company began expensing the second award of   $7,500   concurrent  ly   with the first award beginning in February 2015.  The units associated with these awards are included in the table below. 

The following table summarizes the PSU activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

Asset Acquisition 

On   September 14, 2016  , the Company acquired, through WWE Real Estate Holdings, LLC a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary ( WWE Real Estate ), a building and underlying real property located in Stamford, Connecticut (the  Purchased Property ) from one of the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Newbury Common Associates, LLC and certain of its affiliates. The purchase   price of   $2  6,883   was   funded, in part, by the assumption of an existing mortgage of   $23,000    (  see     Note 12,   Debt  ,   for   further   discussion  ). The Company has been one of the tenants in the Purchased Property for approximately   16   years.  In connection with the acquisition, WWE Real Estate assume  d   the seller s interests as landlord under several existing leases of the Purchased Property, including the landlord s interest in leases under which the Company is a tenant.    S  ince the assets of WWE Real Estate represent collateral for the underlying mortgage, these assets   are   not available to satisfy debts and obligations to any other creditors of the Company.    A  s of September 30, 2016,     costs of     $  28,039  , consisting     of purchase price   and   capitalized transaction costs  , are   reflected in Land, buildings and improvements  , which is a component of Property and equipment, on the Consolidated Balance S  heet  s  .  Depreciation on the Purchased Property is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the Purchased Property in accordance with the Company s existing accounting policy for property and equipment.   

7. Feature Film Production Assets, Net 

Feature film production assets consisted of the following: 

Approximately   43  %   of  In release  film production assets are estimated to be amortized over the nex  t 12 months, and approximately   70  %   of  In release  film production assets are estimated to be amortized over the next three years.  We anticipate amortizing approximately   80%   of   our "In release" film production asset within four years as we receive revenues associated with   television distribution of our licensed films.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we amortized   $  1,719   and   $  1,254  ,    and   $  4,420   and     $2  ,  663  ,    respectively, of feature film production assets.     During these periods, our films were released under a co-distribution model.  Under the co-distribution model, third-party distribution partners   control the distribution and marketing of co-distributed films, and as a result, we recognize revenue on a net basis after the third-party distribut  ion partners   recoup distribution fees and expenses and results are reported to us.  Results are typically reported to us in periods subsequent to the initial release of the film. 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we   released   three   feature film  s  ,    Countdown  ,    Scooby Doo!   WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon  , and   Interrogation  ,    direct to DVD,   which     com  prise  s     $  3,273   of   our  In release    feature film assets as of   September 30, 2016  .        We currently   have   six   films   designated as  Completed but not released  and   have   four   films    In production.   We also have capitalized certain script development costs   and pre-production costs   for various other film projects designated as  In development.     D  evelopment costs are evaluated at each reporting period for impairment and to determine if a project is deemed to be abandoned.  We did   no  t    record   any   impairment charges related to abandoned projects during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Unamortized feature film production assets are evaluated for imp  airment each reporting period.    We review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs at each reporting period to reflect the most current information available.  If estimates for a film s ultimate revenue and/or costs are revised and indicate a significant decline in a film s profitability  ,   or if events or circumstances change that indicate we should assess whether the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized film costs, we calculate the film's estimated fair value using a discounted cash flows model.  If fair value is less than unamortized cost, the film asset is written down to fair value.        We recorded an impairment charge of   $270   related to our feature film  s    during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.    We   did   no  t record any impairment charges during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to our feature films.

8. Television Production Assets, Net 

Television production assets consisted of the following: 

Television production assets consist primarily of   non-live event   episodic television series we have produced for distribution through a variety of platforms including on our WWE Network. Amounts capitalized include development costs, production costs, production overhead and employee salaries. Costs to produce episodic programming for television or distribution on WWE Network are amortized in the proportion that revenues bear to management's estimates of the ultimate revenue expected to be recognized from exploitation, exhibition or sale.  

Amortization of television production assets  , which are included in Costs of revenues,   consisted of the following: 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we   reduced previously recorded amortization expenses for certain   television programming   as their final production costs were less than originally estimated and expensed. 

Costs to produce our live event programming are expensed when the event is first broadcast  ,   and are not included in the capitalized costs or amortization tables noted above. 

Unamortized television production assets are evaluated for impairment each reporting period.  If conditions indicate a potential impairment, and the estimated future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized asset, the asset is written down to fair value.  In addition, if we determine that a program will not likely air, we will   expense   the remaining unamortized asset.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we did   no  t record any impairments related to our television production assets.

Equity Method Investment 

In March 2015, WWE and ABG formed a joint venture to re-launch an apparel and lifestyle brand, Tapout (the "Brand"). ABG agreed to contribute certain intangible assets for the Brand, licensing contracts, systems, and other administrative functions to Tapout.  The Company agreed to contribute promotional and marketing services related to the venture for a period of at least   five   years in exchange for a   50%   interest in the profits and losses   and voting interest in Tapout.  The Company valued its initial investment of     $13,800     based on the fair value of the existing licensing contracts contributed by ABG.        To the extent that Tapout records income or losses, we record our share proportionate to our ownership percentage, and any dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Net equity method earnings from Tapout   are   included as a component of Investment income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net dividends received from Tapout     are   reflected   on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a component of Equity in earnings of affiliate, net of dividends received. The Company did   no  t record any impairment charges related to our investment in Tapout during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .   

The following table presents the net equity method earnings from Tapout and net dividends received from Tapout for the periods presented: 

As promotional services are provided to Tapout, we will record revenue and reduce th  e existing service obligation.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we recorded   revenues   of   $  779   and   $  1,580  , and   $  2,  484   and     $  1,680  ,     respectively  , related   to our fulfillment of our promotional services obligation to Tapout.  The remaining service obligation as of   September 30, 2016   was   $  8,88  6  , and was included in Deferred Income and Non-Current Deferred Income for   $  60  6   and   $  8,280  , respectively. 

Our known maximum exposure to loss approximates the remaining service obligation to Tapout, which was   $  8,88  6   as   of   September 30, 2016  . Creditors of Tapout do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company. 

Cost Method Investments 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we invested $1,000 in a fantasy sports contest provider, $1,000 in a subscription-based sports media company and $250 in a virtual reality platform operator. 

We evaluate our cost method investments for impairment if factors indicate that a significant d  ecrease in value has occurred.   The Company did   no  t record any impairment charges on our cost method investments during the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Short-Term Investments 

Short-term investments measured at fair value consisted of the following: 

We classify the investments listed in the above table as available-for-sale securities.  Such investments consist primarily of corporate and municipal bonds, including pre-refunded municipal bonds.  These investments are stated at fair value as required by the applicable accounting guidance. Unrealized gains and losses on such securities are reflected, net of tax, as other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Our municipal and   corporate bonds are included in Short-term investments, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Realized gains and losses on investments are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.  As of   September 30, 2016  , contractual maturities of these bonds are as follows: 

Maturities  

Municipal bonds  

1   day -   2   years  

Corporate bonds  

3   months -   2   years  

The following table summarizes the short-term investment activity: 

10  . Fair Value Measurement 

Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in   an orderly transaction between   market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value is a market-based measurement based on assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability.  Accordingly, the framework considers markets or observable inputs as the preferred source of value followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions, in the absence of market inputs.  The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.  In addition, the fair value of assets and liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company's own credit risk  . 

Additionally, the accounting guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of information used in developing fair value estimates.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data.  In cases where two or more levels of inputs are used to determine fair value, a financial instrument's level is determined based on the lowest level input that is considered significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows  : 

Level 1-  

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level 2-  

Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable; or  

Level 3-  

Unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, in which little or no market data exists.  

The following assets are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the classification within the hierarchy was as follows: 

Certain financial instruments are carried at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, money market accounts, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of such instruments  .   The carrying amount of short-term debt outstanding pursuant to our Film Credit Facility approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates. 

We have classifi  ed our investment in municipal and   corporate bonds within Level 2, as their valuation requires quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and/or model-

based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observab  le market data.  The municipal and   corporate     bonds are valued based on model-driven valuations.  A third party service provider assists the Company with compiling market prices from a variety of industry standard data sources, security master files from large financial institutions and other third-party sources that a  re used to value our municipal and corporate   bond investments.  The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 fair value investments during the periods presented  . 

The fair value measurements of our cost method investments are classified within Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs are used to measure the fair value of these assets due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.  Significant unobservable inputs include variables such as near-term prospects of the investees, recent financing activities of the investees, and the investees' capital structure, as well as other economic variables, which reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing these assets.  Our investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized.  The Company did   no  t record an  y   impairment charge  s   on these assets during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .   

The Company's long lived property and equipment, feature film and television production assets are required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis   if it is determined that indicators of impairment exist.  These assets are recorded at fair value only whe  n an impairment is recognized.   During the three   and nine     months ended   September     30  ,   201  5  , the Company   recorded   impairment charges   of   $270   on feature film production assets based upon fair value measurements of   $1,430  .    The Company did not record any such charges during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .    The Company classifies these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to significant unobservable inputs  . 

The fair value of the Company s long-term debt, consisting   of   a   mortgage loan   assumed in connection with a building purchase   and   a promissory note secured by the Company's Corporate Jet, is estimated based upon quoted price estimates   for similar debt arrangements.   At   September 30, 2016  , the face amount of the   mortgage loan and promissory   note approximates   their   fair value  .       

11  . Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following: 

Accrued other includes accruals for our international and licensing business activities, as well as other miscellaneous accruals, none of which categories individually exceed  s    5%   of current liabilities.    The de  crease in accrued expenses is primarily due to the   payout of the Company s fiscal 2015 bonus   during the first quarter of 2016  .

Mortgage 

On September   14  , 2016, the Company acquired, through WWE Real Estate,   the Purchased Property from one of the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Newbury Common Associates, LLC and certain of its affiliates.    See Note 6,   Property and   Equipment  , for further discussion.   In   connection with the acquisition,   WWE Real Estate   entered into a Note and Mortgage Assumption Agreement, dated   September 13, 2016   (the  Assumption Agreement ),   with Hamilton and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the registered holders of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-NXS2, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-NXS2 (the  Lender ).  Pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, WWE Real Estate   paid the L  ender approximately   $1,865   as a bring current payment and assumed future obligations under a Loan Agreement, dated June 8, 2015, between the seller and the lender, in the principal amount of   $23,000  , which loan is secured by a mortgage on the Purchased Property.    As part of this debt assumption, the Company executed a Joinder By and Agreement of New Indemnitor pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee limited recourse obligations of WWE Real Estate and to certain limited indemnification obligations.  The loan bears interest at the rate of   4.50%   per annum and requires monthly payments of interest only until June 2018 and   $117   per month thereafter, with a balloon payment on maturity in   July 2025  . There is a significant yield maintenance premium for prepayments.    Pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, since the assets of WWE Real Estate represent collateral for the underlying mortgage, these assets will not be available to satisfy debts and obligations due to any other creditors of the Company. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

On July   29, 2016  , the Company entered into a  n amended and restated     $150  ,000   senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicated group of banks, with JPMorgan Chase   Bank, N.A.   acting as   A  dministrativ  e A  gent (the "  Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility").    The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility replaces the previous   $200,000   revolving credit facility which was set to expire on September 9. 2016. Among other things, t  he   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility   extends   the maturity date to   July 29, 20  21  , modifies   the applicable margin for   borrowings under the facility and   amend  s   restrictions on certain financial covenants to provide fo  r greater financial flexibility  .    Applicable interest rates for the borrowings under the   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility are based on the Company's current consolidated leverage ratio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the LIB  OR-based rate plus   margin was   2.10  %  .     The Company is required to pay a commitment fee calculated at a rate per annum of   0.2  5  0  %   on the average daily unused portion of the   Amended and Restated   Revolving C  redit   Facility.   Under the terms of the   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and limitations with respect to our indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, investments, capital expenditures and transactions with affiliates. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the   Amended and   Restated   Revolvin  g Credit Facility  , and had available debt capacity under the terms of the   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility of   $  150,000  .

Film Credit Facility 

In May   2015,   two   domestic subsidiaries of the Company, WWE Studios Finance Corp. and WWE Studios Finance Holding Corp. (collectively, the  Loan Parties ) entered into a   $35,000   secured asset based revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and lender (the  Film Credit Facility ).  Funds under the Film Credit Facility can be used for, among other things, development of films and television projects. Under the Film Credit Facility, the WWE Studios Finance Corp. is allowed to borrow amounts of up to an aggregate of $35,000 based on a borrowing base formula.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,    borrowings of   $1,583   have   been made     under the Film Credit Facility.    The Company has the intent and ability to repay the amounts outstanding on the Film Credit Facility wi  thin one year, and a  s such, the outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016   has been classified as a current portion of long-term debt within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.    The Film Credit Facility has a   five  -year term, and it is secured by substantially all t  he assets of the Loan Parties.   The applicable interest rate for borrowings under the Film Credit Facility is a LIBOR-based rate plus   2.50%   on LIBOR-based borrowings or an alternate base rate plus   1.50%   for alternate base rate borrowings, in all cases subje  ct to adjustment   based on the status of film projects.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the LIB  OR-based rate plus margin   was   3.35  %  .   The   Loan Parties are required to pay certain fees, including a commitment fee, calculated at a rate per annum of   0.50%   on the average daily unutilized portion of the Film Credit Facility.  Under the terms of the Film Credit Facility, the Loan Parties are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, investments, capital expenditures, and trans  actions with affiliates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the Film Credit Facility  ,    and had   $  6,000   of   available   capacity under the terms of the Film Credit Facility  . 

Aircraft Financing 

In August   2013  , the Company entered into a   $31,568   promissory note (the  Note ) with Citizens Asset Finance, Inc., for the purchase of a 2007 Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft and refurbishments.  The Note bears interest at a rate of   2.18%   per annum, is payable in monthly installments of   $406  , inclusive of interest, beginning in September 2013, and has a final maturity of   August 7,   2020  .  The Note is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in the purchased aircraft.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amounts outstan  ding related to the   Note were   $18,253   and     $2  1,575  , respectively. 

13  . Concentration of Credit Risk 

We continually monitor our position with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties   to our financial instruments.   Our accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of distributors, including our   WWE   Network, television, pay-per-view, and home video distributors, and licensees that produce consumer products containing our intellectual property.  We closely monitor the status of receivables with these customers and maintain allowances for anticipated   losses as deemed appropriate.   At   September 30, 2016  , our largest receivabl  e balance from   customers w  as     15  %     of     our gross accounts receivable.   At   December 31, 2015  ,    our   two   largest receivable balances from customers   were     1  5  %     and   14%     of our gross accounts receivable. No other customers individually exceeded 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance  . 

1  4  . Income Taxes 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $33,538     of deferred   tax assets, net,   included in   non-  current   income tax   assets in our Consolidated   Balance Sheet  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , we   had   $44,709   of deferred tax assets, net, included in non-current income tax assets in our Consolidated   Balance Sheet  .   

The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods.  The Company believes that based on past performance, expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset  s   will be realized.  Changes in these factors may cause us to increase our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our income tax expense in the period we determine that these factors have changed.

Legal Proceedings 

On October 23, 2014, a lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the District of Oregon, entitled   William Albert Haynes III, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    This complaint was amended on January 30, 2015 and alleges that the Company ignored, downplayed, and/or failed to disclose the risks associated with traumatic brain injuries suffered by WWE s performers.  On March 31, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the first amended class action complaint in its entirety or, if not dismissed, to transfer the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  Without addressing the merits of the Company's motion to dismiss, the Court transferred the case to Connecticut on June 25, 2015.  The plaintiffs filed an objection to such transfer, which was denied on July 27, 2015.  On January 16, 2015, a second lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, entitled   Evan Singleton and Vito LoGrasso, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.  , alleging many of the same allegations as   Haynes  .  On February 27, 2015, the Company moved to transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut due to forum-selection clauses in the contracts between WWE and the plaintiffs and that motion was granted on March 23, 2015.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 22, 2015 and, following a scheduling conference in which the court ordered the plaintiffs to cure various pleading deficiencies, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on June 15, 2015.  On June 29, 2015, WWE moved to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety.   On April 9, 2015, a third lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California, entitled   Russ McCullough, a/k/a  Big Russ McCullough,  Ryan Sakoda, and Matthew R. Wiese a/k/a  Luther Reigns,  individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.  , asserting similar allegations to   Haynes  .  The Company again moved to transfer the lawsuit to Connecticut due to forum-selection clauses in the contracts between WWE and the plaintiffs, which the California court granted on July 10, 2015.  On September 21, 2015, the plaintiffs amended this complaint and, on November 16, 2015, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  Each of these suits seeks unspecified actual, compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief, including ordering medical monitoring.  The Haynes and McCullough cases purport to be class actions.  On February 18, 2015, a lawsuit was filed in Tennessee state court and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, entitled   Cassandra Frazier, individually and as next of kin to her deceased husband, Nelson Lee Frazier, Jr., and as personal representative of the Estate of Nelson Lee Frazier, Jr. Deceased, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    A similar suit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entitled   Michelle James, as mother and next friend of Matthew Osborne, minor child, and Teagan Osborne, a minor child v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.   These lawsuits contain many of the same allegations as the other lawsuits alleging traumatic brain injuries and further allege that the injuries contributed to these former talents  deaths.  WWE moved to transfer the   Frazier   and   Osborne   lawsuits to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut based on forum-selection clauses in the decedents  contracts with WWE, which motions were granted by the respective courts.  On November 23, 2015, amended complaints were filed in   Frazier   and   Osborne  , which the Company moved to dismiss on December 16, 2015 and December 21, 2015, respectively.    On June 29, 2015, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U. S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled   World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. v. Robert Windham, Thomas Billington, James Ware, Oreal Perras and various John and Jane Does   seeking a declaration against these former performers that their threatened claims related to alleged traumatic brain injuries and/or other tort claims are time-barred.  On September 21, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, which the Company

opposed.  The Court previously ordered a stay of discovery in all cases pending decisions on the motions to dismiss.  On January 15, 2016, the Court partially lifted the stay and permitted discovery only on three issues in the case involving Singleton and LoGrasso.  Such discovery was completed by June 1, 2016, and on March 21, 2016, the Court issued a memorandum of decision granting in part and denying in part the Company s motions to dismiss the Haynes, Singleton/LoGrasso, and McCullough lawsuits.  The Court granted the Company s motions to dismiss the Haynes and McCullough lawsuits in their entirety and granted the Company s motion to dismiss all claims in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit except for the claim of fraud by omission.  On March 22, 2016, the Court issued an order dismissing the Windham lawsuit based on the Court s memorandum of decision on the motions to dismiss.  On April 4, 2016, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the Court s decision not to dismiss the fraud by omission claim in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit and, on April 5, 2016, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the Court dismissal of the Windham lawsuit.  On July 21, 2016, the Court denied the Company s motion in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit and granted in part the Company s motion in the Windham lawsuit.  On April 20, 2016, the plaintiffs filed notices of appeal of the Haynes and McCullough lawsuits.  On April 27, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss the appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction, which motions were granted and the appeals were dismissed with leave to appeal upon the resolution of all of the consolidated cases.  The Company filed a motion for summary judgment on the sole remaining claim in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit on August 1, 2016.  Lastly, on July 18, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, entitled   Joseph M. Laurinaitis, et al. vs. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and Vincent K. McMahon, individually and as the trustee of certain trusts  .  This lawsuit contains many of the same allegations as the other lawsuits alleging traumatic brain injuries and further alleges, among other things, that the plaintiffs were misclassified as independent contractors rather than employees denying them, among other things, rights and benefits under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), federal tax law, and various state Worker s Compensation laws.  This lawsuit also alleges that the booking contracts and other agreements between the plaintiffs and the Company are unconscionable and should be declared void, entitling the plaintiffs to certain damages relating to the Company s use of their intellectual property.  The lawsuit alleges claims for violation of RICO, unjust   enrichment, and an a  ccounting against Mr. McMahon.      The Company and Mr. McMahon moved to dismi  ss this complaint on October 19, 2016.    The   Company believes all claims and threatened claims against the Company in these various lawsuits are being prompted by the same plaintiffs  lawyer and are without merit.  The Company intends to continue to defend itself against these lawsuits vigorously.   

On August 9, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled   Marcus Bagwell, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, C.G.S.  42-110a, et seq., principally arising from WWE s alleged failure to pay royalties for streaming video on the WWE Network.  On September 7, 2016, a motion for leave to amend was filed along with a proposed amended complaint that, among other things, seeks to add Scott Levy as an individual plaintiff and WCW, Inc. as a defendant. The Company believes all claims against the Company in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously. 

In addition to the foregoing, we are involved in several other lawsuits and claims that we consider to be in the ordinary course of our business.  By its nature, the outcome of litigation is not known, but the Company does not currently expect this ordinary course litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We may, from time to time, become a party to other legal proceedings.

Results of Operations 

The Company presents OIBDA as the primary measure of segment profit (loss). The Company defines OIBDA as operating income before   depreciation and amortization (  excluding feature film and television production asset amortization and impairments, as well as the amortization of costs related to content delivery and technology assets utilized for our WWE Network  )  . The Company believes the presentation of OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view our segment performance in the same manner as the primary method used by management to evaluate segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources.   Additionally, we believe that OIBDA provides a meaningful representation of operating cash flows within our segments. 

OIBDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and may be different than similarly-titled non-GAAP financial mea  sures used by other companies.   A limitation of OIBDA is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic charge for certain fixed assets and intangible assets used in generating revenu  es for our business.   OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance, or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We believe that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA.  See Note 3,   Segment Information  , in the accompanying c  onsolidated   f  inancial   s  tatements for a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income for the periods presented. 

We   record   certain costs   within   our Corporate and Other segment   since the costs benefit the Company as a whole and are not directly attributable to our other reportable segments. These costs are categorized and presented into two categories, Corporate Support and Business Support.   Corporate   Support expenses primarily include our   corporate   general and administrative functions. Business Support expenses include our   sales and marketing   functions  , our international   sales   offices, talent development   costs  , including costs associated with our WWE Performance Center  , and our business strategy and data analytics functions  .    Revenues from transactions between our   operating segments are not material. Included in Corporate and Other are intersegment eliminations recorded in consolidation.

Summary 

Our Media division   revenues   de  creased by   4  % compared   to the prior year quarter, primarily due to   the   impact   of certain television programming,   partially   offset by   increased subscription revenue related to the growth of WWE Network in new and existing territories     and   the escalation of television rights fees  .    Our Live Events segment     revenues   in  creased   by   10  %, primarily   driven by   additional events in our international markets  .    Our Consumer Pr  oducts division experienced a   4%   de  crease in revenues  , primarily driven by   lower   effective licensing royalty rates   and   lower sales of our   toy   products  ,    partially   offset by   higher   WWEShop   merchandise   sales  .

Refer to Note 3,   Segment Information  , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the refinement of our cost allocation methodology between the Network and Television segments, which was implemented during the first quarter of 2016  , with further refinements made during the third quarter of 2016  .    During the current year quarter,   approximately $  3.2   million   of costs were allocated from Television to Network.  A comparable allocation did not occur in the prior year.     

Network revenues, which include revenues generated by WWE Network a  nd pay-per-view,   increased by   $4.2   million, or   10%  , in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.  WWE Network revenues increased by   $6.4   million, or   18%  ,   in   the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the increase in paid subscribers.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , W  WE Network had   an avera  ge   of   1,458,000   paid subscribers  , compared to an average of   1,  173,000   subscribers in the prior year quarter. During the qua  rter there were approx  imately   388,300   gross additions to WWE Network s subscr  iber base, offset by churn of   454,700   subscribers  .  Gross additions include unique new subscribers and win-backs (subscribers that previously churned out and subsequently   renewed their subscription).  The subscription pricing of WWE Network at   September 30, 2016   is $9.99 per mo  nth with no minimum commitment.   The increased revenues generated by WWE Network in the current year quarter were partially offset by the decline in   pay-per-view   revenues   of     $2.2   million, or   49  %,   primarily   due to the continued growth and expansion of WWE Network  ; as WWE Network   grow  s  , p  ay-per-view revenues are expected to decline   since

our pay-per-view events are available on WWE Network.    Network OIBDA as a percentage of revenues decreased to   39%   in the current year quarter as compared to 4  3  % in the prior year quarter  .    The   decline in Network OIBDA   was due to     higher   programming costs and   the impact of shared costs that we now allocate to the Network segment from our   Television segment.  On January   1, 2016, we began allocating certain shared costs and expenses between our Network and Television segments, as these   allocations are intended to more accurately reflect the operating performance of these segments.    During the third quarter of 2016, we   allocated    $  3.2   million   of costs from our Television segment to WWE Network  .  A comparable allocation did not occur in the prior year quarter. 

Television revenues, which inclu  de revenues generated from   television   rights fees and advertising, de  creased by   $8.9   million, or   14%  , in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter  .    This decrease is   primarily   attributed to   the   impact   of our licensed   reality   series,     Total   Divas     and   Tough Enough.   There were no   new episodes   of these programs   in the current year quarter  ,    while the prior year quarter included   21 episodes and   $13.6 million of revenues   relating to our licensed reality series  .    These decreases were partially offset by contractual increases   associated with   certain   television distribution agr  eements.     Television OIBDA as a percentage of revenues increased to   58%   in the current year quarter as compared to 41  % in the prior year quarter,   primarily driven by   a    decrease   in   production costs   associated with   the licensed reality series   noted above  , which have lower margins than our other television content  .    In addition, Television OIBDA was favorably impacted by   a $  3.2   million   benefit due to allocating certain production costs to the WWE Network  , as described above. 

Home   entertainment revenues, which include revenues generated from the sale of WWE produced content via home entertainment platforms such as DVD and Blu-Ray discs and di  gital downloads,   decreased by   $0.5   million, or   17%  ,    in the   current year quarter   as   compared to the prior year quart  er  .    The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of an 18% decline in the average price per unit sold.    Home entertainment OIBD  A as a percentage of revenues de  creased to   36%   in the curren  t year quarter as compared to 43  %    in   the prior year   quarter,   due to lower average selling prices coupled with     higher   material costs  . 

Digital media revenues   increased by   $0.7   million, or   12%  ,   in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to   increased   advertising revenues   from our content on   YouTube. Digital media OIBD  A as a percentage of revenues de  creased to   40%   in the current year   quarter as compared to 55  % in the prior year quarter,   primarily driven   by increased staff related and professional services costs.

Live Events 

The following tables present the performance results and key drivers for our Live Events segment (dollars in millions, except where noted): 

Live events revenues, which include revenues from tick  et sales and travel packages,   increased by   $2.5   million, or   10%  , in   the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter  .    Revenues from our North   America live events business   remained relatively flat  ,    as the   impact of eight     fewer   events was mostly offset by increases in attendance and average ticket prices  .    Revenues   from our international live events business   increased by   $2.5   million, or   56%  ,   primarily     due to the impact of five additional events  .    Live events OIBDA as a perce  ntage of revenue de  creased to   21%   in the current year quarter   as   compared to   25  % in the   prior year quarter,   primarily   driven by   increased costs associated with staging events in certain emerging markets  .

Consumer Products Division 

The following tables present the performance results and key drivers for our Consumer Products division (dollars in millions, except where noted): 

Licensing revenues   decreased by   $2.5   million, or   22%  , in the   current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter, driven largely   by   lower effective royalty rates related to   our   franchise   video   game,   WWE2K16  ,    and   lower sales of our   toy products in domestic and international markets  .        The lower effective rates in the current year quarter are the result of changes in contractual terms compared to the prior year, but essentially are a timing difference, as effective rates over the life of the game are expected to be consistent with prior releases.    Licensing   OIBDA as a percentage of revenues decreased to   51%   in the curren  t year quarter as compared to 62  % in the prior year quarter,   primarily   due to   the   decreased revenues and slightly higher fixed costs  . 

Venue merchandise revenues in  creased by   $0.2   million, or   4%  , in   the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter  , primarily due   to   a    2  % increase   in per capita merchandise spend.     Venue merchandise OIBDA as a percentage of revenues   was essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter  .    

WWEShop revenues increased   by   $1.5   million, or   25%  , in   the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, due to a   27  % increase in the volume of online merch  andise sales to approximately   170,800   orders  . Orders increased primarily due to the impact of   additional distribution channels, including in international territories,   continued   marketing   efforts   and   offering a broad   assortme  nt   of products  . This increase was partially offset by a   4%   decline in the average revenue per   order to   $42.48   in   the current year quarter. WWEShop OIBDA as a percentage of revenues   remained   relatively   flat   as compared to the prior year quart  er  . 

WWE Studios 

WWE Studios revenues   increased by   $0.8   million, or   47%  ,   in the current year quarter as compared t  o the prior year quarter.  We released   two   feature film  s  ,    Scooby Doo!   WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon   and   Interrogation  ,    in the current year quarter   as compared to   one film   in   the prior year quarter.  As we typically participate in a film s results subsequent to our distributor s recoupment of costs, there is a lag between a film s release and its impact on revenue. WWE Studios   revenues of   $2.5   million   in the current year quarter   includes $  0.8   million   from film releases in 2015, with prior releases contributing the remainder of film revenues.  WWE Studios   revenues of $  1.7   million in the prior year quarter   includes $  0.  6   million from film releases in 2014, with prior releases contributing the remainder of film revenues.    WWE Studios OIBDA   increased   $1.8   million   in the current year quarter as compared to the pr  ior year quarter, due, in part,   to the increase in revenues  , and changes to the terms of the distribution of a previously released film, which resulted in lower expenses  .    

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company   had   $29.8   million (net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges) of Feature Film Production Assets capitalized on   our   Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which   $14.1   million is for films in-release,   $7.8   million is for films in production, and the remaining   $7.9   million   is for   films that are completed, pending release, or developmental projects. We review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs at the end of each reporting quarter to reflect the most current information available. If estimates for a film s ultimate revenue and/or costs are revised and indicate a significant decline in a film s

profitability, or if events or circumstances change that would indicate we should assess whether the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized film costs, we calculate the film's estimated fair value using a discounted cash flows model. If fair value is less than unamortized cost, the film asset is written down to fair value.    There were no impairment charges recorded in the current year quarter.    We recorded an impairment charge of $  0.3 million   during the prior year quarter.   

Corporate   and   Other 

We record certain costs within our Corporate and Other segment since the costs benefit the Company as a whole and are not directly attributable to our other reportable segments. These costs are categorized and presented into two categories, Corporate Support and Business Support.  Corporate Support expenses primarily include our corporate general and administrative functions.  Business Support expenses include our sales and marketing functions, our international sales offices, talent development costs, including costs associated with our WWE Performance Center, and our business strateg  y and data analytics functions.   The presentation of Corporate and Other expenses in these two categories provides further details on the primary composition of our Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as the majority of Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses from our Corporate and Other segment.   

The following table presents the financial results for our Corporate and Other segment (dollars in millions):

Talent related expenses within Business Support include costs associated with our WWE Performance Center, talent appearances and certain talent   support   costs.    T  alent costs   associated with specific revenue streams   are excluded from the above amounts and included within   applicable   business segments  .     

Corporate and Other expenses   increased   by   $2.9   million  , or   7%  , in   the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quar  ter.  This increase is primarily due to   investments in   global branding, data analytics and certain talent initiatives  .

Our Live Events segment revenues increased by   15%  , primarily driven by higher average domestic ticket prices   and the impact of additional events in our international markets  . Our Consumer Products division experienced a  n     8%   increase in revenues, primarily driven by increased merchandise sales.

During the   peri  od there were   approximately   1,511,400   gross additions to WWE Network s subscriber base, offset by churn   of   1,284,300   subscribers  .  Gross additions include unique new subscribers and win-backs (subscribers that previously churned out and subsequently   renewed their subscription).  The subscription pricing of WWE Network at   September 30, 2016   is $9.99 per mon  th with no minimum commitment.   The increased   revenues generated by WWE Network in the

current year period were partially offset by the decline in   pay-per-view   revenues   of   $6.7   million, or   39%  . This   decline was primarily attributable to the continued gro  wth and expansion of WWE Network; as WWE Network grows, pay-per-view revenues are expected to decline since our pay-per-view events are available on WWE Network.    Network OIBDA as a percentage of revenues decreased to   20%   in the curre  nt year period as compared to 28  % in the prior year period  .  The decline in Net  work OIBDA was due to higher programming costs and   the impact of shared costs that we now allocate to the Network segment from our Television segment.  On January 1, 2016, we began allocating certain shared costs and expenses between our Network and Television segments, as these allocations are intended to more accurately reflect the operating performance of these segments.  The impact of   the   allocation during the current year period was a decline to Network OIBDA   of $  11.6   million.  A comparable allocation did not occur in the prior year   period  . 

Television re  venues, which include revenues generated from television   rights fees and advertising,   de  creased by   $2.4   million, or   1%  , in the   current   year   period   as   compared to the prior year   period  .    This decrease is primarily attributed to   the   impact   of our licensed   reality   series,   Total   Divas     and   Tough Enough.   There were   14   new   episodes   of   our licensed reality programming     in the current year period as   compared to 3  3 episodes     in   the prior year   period  , which resulted in a decrease in revenues of $11.6 million  .    These decreases were partially offset by the results of contractual increases   associated with   certain   television distribution agr  eements.    Television OIBDA as a percentage of revenues increased to   51%   in the current year period as compared to 4  2  % in the prior year period,   primarily driven by a   change in product mix, as the licensed   reality   series mentioned above typically have a lower margin than our other television programming  .     Additionally  , Television OIBDA was favorably impacted by   an $  11.6   million   allocation methodology change, as described above. 

Home   entertainment revenues, which include revenues generated from the sale of WWE produced content via home entertainment platforms such as DVD and Blu-Ray discs and di  gital downloads,   decreased by   $1.9   million, or   18%  , in   the current year   period   compared to the prior year   period.  The decrease was due to a   28%   decline in units shipped  , partially offset by the impact of   a    3  % increase   in th  e average price per unit sold.    Home entertainment OIBDA as a percentage of revenues   was essentially unchanged from the prior year period  . 

Digital media revenues   increased by   $4.5   million, or   32%  , in   the current year   period   as compared to the prior year   period  , primarily due to   increased   advertising revenues   from our content on   YouTube. Digital media OIBD  A as a percentage of revenues de  creased to   15%   in the current year period as compared   to 1  7  % the prior year period,   primarily driven   by increased staff related and professional services costs   to support various technology initiatives  .

Live events revenues, which include revenues from tick  et sales and travel packages,   increased by   $14.0   million, or   15%  , in   the current year   period   as comp  ared to the prior year period.  Revenues from our North America live events business   increased by   $7.6   million, or   10%  , primarily   due to   higher average ticket prices, including   WrestleMania  .        Revenues   from our international live events business increa  sed   by   $5.5   million, or   37%  , primarily     due to   the impact of six additional events and   higher   attendance  ,    partially offset by   lower average ticket prices associated with the territories in which we performed.   Live events OIBDA as a percentage of revenue   increased slightly in the current year period as co  mpared to the prior year period  .

The following tables present the performance results and key drivers for our Consumer Products division (dollars in millions, except where noted): 

Licensing revenues   de  creased by   $  0.3   million, or   1%  , in   the   current year   period   as compared to the prior year   period  ,    driven largely   by   lower sales of our toy products in domestic and international markets  .    Licensing   OIBDA as a percentage of revenues   de  creased to   58%   in the current year period as compared to 62% in     the prior year period  , primarily due to   increased talent participation expenses driven by   product mix  . 

Venue merchandise revenues   increased by   $1.3   million, or   7%  , in the   current year period as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in domestic per capita merchandise spending of   5%  .        Venue merchandise OIBDA as a percentage of revenues   was essentially unchanged from     the prior year period  .    

WWEShop revenues increased by   $4.7   million, or   27%  , in the current year period compared to the prior year period, due to a   32  % increase in the volume of online merch  andise sales to approximately   495,500   orders  . Orders increased primarily due to the impact of   additional   distribution channels,     including in international territories,   continued     marketing   efforts   and   offering a broad   assortment of products  . This incr  ease was partiall  y offset by a   5%   decline in the average revenue per   order to   $43.48   in   the   current year   period  .    WWEShop   OIBDA as a percentage of revenues decreased   slightly   in the current year period as compared to the prior year period,   partially due to product   and channel   mix  . 

WWE Studios 

WWE Studios revenues   increased   by   $2.4   million, or   45%  ,   in the   current year   period   as compared t  o the prior year period.  We released   three   feature film  s  ,    Countdown  ,    Scooby Doo!   WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon  , and   Interrogation  ,     in the current year period as compared to   four   films in the prior year period.  As we typically participate in a film s results subsequent to our distributor s recoupment of costs, there is a lag between a film s release and its impact on revenue. WWE Studios   revenues of   $7.7   million   in the current year period   include $  2.7   million   from film releases in 2015, with prior releases contributing the remainder of film revenues.  WWE Studios   revenues of $  5.3   million in the prior year   period   include  s    $  2.1   million from film releases in 2014, with prior releases contributing the remainder of film   revenues.   WWE Studios   OIBDA increased   $2.2   million   in the current year period as compared to the prior year period,   due, in part,   to the increase in revenues  , and changes to the terms of the distribution of a previously released film, which resulted in lower expenses  .    

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company   had   $29.8   million (net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges) of Feature Film Production Assets capitalized on   our   Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which   $14.1   million is for films in-release,   $7.8   million is for films in production, and the remaining   $7.9   million is for films that are completed, pending release, or developmental projects. We review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and   participation costs at the end of each reporting quarter to reflect the most current information available. If estimates for a film s ultimate revenue and/or costs are revised and indicate a significant decline in a film s profitability, or if events or circumstances change that would indicate we should assess whether the fair value of a film is less than its

unamortized film costs, we calculate the film's estimated fair value using a discounted cash flows model. If fair value is less than unamortized cost, the film asset is written down to fair value.    There were no impairment charges recorded in the current year period.    We recorded an impairment charge of $  0.3 million   during the prior year period.   

Corporate   and   Other 

We record certain costs within our Corporate and Other segment since the costs benefit the Company as a whole and are not directly attributable to our other reportable segments. These costs are categorized and presented into two categories, Corporate Support and Business Support.  Corporate Support expenses primarily include our corporate general and administrative functions.  Business Support expenses include our sales and marketing functions, our international sales offices, talent development costs, including costs associated with our WWE Performance Center, and our business strateg  y and data analytics functions.   The presentation of Corporate and Other expenses in these two categories provides further details on the primary composition of our Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as the majority of Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses from our Corporate and Other segment.   

The following table presents the financial results for our Corporate and Other segment (dollars in millions):

Talent related expenses within Business Support include costs associated with our WWE Performance Center, talent appearances and certain talent   support   costs.        Talent costs associated with specific revenue streams are excluded from the above amounts and included within applicable business segments.     

Corporate and Other expenses   increased   by   $13.9   million  , or   11%  , in   the current year   period   as compared to the prior year   period.  This increase is primarily due to increase  s   in   talent related costs and   professional fees within our Business Support departments in support of com  pany-wide strategic initiatives, and investments in global branding  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had cash and short-term   inv  estments of   $67.6   million   and $102.4   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds and municipal bonds, including pre-refunded municipal bon  ds.  Our debt balance   totaled   $42.8   million   and $  21.6   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

We believe that our existing cash and investment balances   combined with   cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements over the next twelve months, inclusive of dividend payments, debt service, film and television production activities and capital expenditures. 

Borrowing Capacity 

On July 29, 2016  , the Company entered into a  n amended and restated     $150  .0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicated group of banks, with JPMorgan Chase   Bank, N.A.   acting as   A  dministrativ  e A  gent (the "  Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility").    The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility replaces the previous $200  .0 million   revolving credit facility which   was set to expire on September   9  , 2016.    Among other things, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility extends the maturity date to July 29, 20  21  , modifies the applicable margin for borrowings under the facility and amends restrictions on certain financial covenants to provide for greater financial flexibility. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the provisions of our $  150.0   million   Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility  , there   were no amounts   outstanding under the   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit Facility  , and the Company had   available capacity under the terms of the   Amended and Restated   Revolving Credit   Facility   of $  150.0   million  .   

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was also in compliance with the provisions of   the   $35.0 million secured asset based revolving credit facility   entered into by two of the Company s subsidiaries (the "Film Credit Facility")  ,    with     $1.6 million   outstanding   and   $  6.0   million   of   available capacity under the terms of the Film Credit Facility.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Cash generated from operating activ  ities   w  as   $19.7   million in the current year   period  ,    compared to $  31.9     million for the corresponding period in the prior year.  The   $12.2   million   de  cr  ease in cash   generated   by operating acti  vities   is   primarily driven by   an increased payout of management incentive compensation compared to the prior year period. 

In the current year   period  ,    we     spent   $7.1   million   on feature film produ  ction activities, compared to $4.  3   million in the prior year   period  .    We   receive  d     $  1.0   million   of incentives related to   feature film production in the current year   period, compared to   $  1.4   million   received in the prior year period  .  We anticipate   spending between $  2   million and $  7   million   on feature film production activities during the remainder of the current year. 

In the current year   period  , we   received    $  8.5     million   of non-film related incentives associated with television production activities, compared to $  3.  5   million   received   in the prior year   period  .    We anticipate   receiving   approximately $  4   million to $  10   million   of   non-film related incentives during the remainder of the year. 

In the current year   period  , we   spent   $23.7   million   to produce   non-live event programming   for television,   including   Total Divas Season   6  ,    Total Divas Season 5   and   Total Bellas,   and   various programs for the WWE Network,   in  cluding   Camp WWE  ,    Holy Foley   and   Swerved S  eason 2  ,    compared to $  26  .6   million in the prior year   period  .  We anticipate spending approximately $  5   million to $  15   million to produce   additional   non-live event   content during the remainder of the current year. 

Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets and relate principally to a limited number of distributors and licensees that produce consumer products containing our intellectual property.  At   September 30, 2016  , our largest receivabl  e balance from customers   w  as     15  %    of our   gross accounts receivable.  Changes in the financial condition or operations of our distributors, customers or licensees may result in increased delayed payments or non-payments which would adversely impact our cash flows from operating activities and/or our results of operations. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Non-Cash Investing   and Financing   Transactions 

On September   14  , 2016, the Company acquired, through WWE Real Estate,   the Purchased Property from one of the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Newbury Common Associates, LLC and certain of its affiliates. In connection with the acquisition,   WWE Real Estate   entered into a Note and Mortgage Assumption Agreement, dated   September 13, 2016   (the  Assumption Agreement ),   with Hamilton and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the registered holders of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-NXS2, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-NXS2 (the  Lender ).  Pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, WWE Real Estate   assumed future obligations under a Loan Agreement, dated June 8, 2015, between   the seller and the lender  , in the principal amount of $23  .0 million  , which loan is secured by a mortgage on the Purchased Property.    The Company s assumption of this mortgage is a non-cash transaction for purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

During   the first quarter of 2015  , the Company received an equity interest in Tapout valu  ed at $13.8 million in exchange for   promotional service obligations to be provided in the futur  e.  The Company s contribution wa  s a non-cash transaction for purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Contractual Obligations 

Other than the   assumption of a mortgage in connection with our recent building acquisition  ,    t  here have been no significant changes to our contractual obligations that were previously disclosed in our Report on Form 10-K for the fis  cal year ended   December 31, 2015  .    

Application of Critical Accounting Policies   

T  here have been no significant changes to our accounting policies that were previously disclosed in our Report on Form 10-K for   our fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   or in the methodology used in formulating these significant judgments and estimates that affect the application of these policies.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In   August   2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Stan  dards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15  ,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,    which addresses eight specific cash flow issues and is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments in the ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, th  e FASB   issue  d    ASU     No. 2016-09,    Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ,       which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The amendments require entities to record all excess tax benefits or deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and would require entities to classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will also allow entities to provide net settlement of stock-based awards to cover tax withholding obligations without classifying the awards as a liability as long as the net settlement does not exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate. The amounts paid to satisfy the statutory income tax withholding obligation would be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the amendments allow entities to elect an accounting policy to either continue to use a forfeiture estimate on share based awards or account for forfeitures when they occur. The new guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,    Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   . The amendments eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when a change in ownership occurs. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investment and adopt the equity method of accounting as of  

41   

Table of Contents  

the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard and do  es   not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842)  ,      which will supersede the existing guidance for lease accounting. This new standard will require lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. The new standard requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  An entity will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,    Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ,      which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting). Under the new guidance, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available-for-sale in other comprehensive income, and they will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. However, entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. The guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans is not impacted The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company is effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,    Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ,  which requires all inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory that is accounted for using the LIFO or the retail inventory method, which will be measured under existing accounting standards. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which for the Company will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ." This standard will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, "  Revenue Recognition  ," and most industry-specific guidance. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services. In addition, during 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Principle versus Agent Considerations  ,  ASU No. 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  and ASU No. 2016-12,    Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ,  all of which clarify certain implementation guidance in ASU No. 2014-09.  This standard along with the subsequent clarifications issued are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, making it effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard allows an entity to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.   We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this new standard, along with subsequent clarifying guidance, on our consolidated financial   statements.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings, in press releases, earnings calls and other statements made by our authorized officers:   (i) risks relating to WWE Network; (ii) risks relating to entering, maintaining and renewing major distribution agreements; (iii) our need to continue to develop creative and entertaining programs and events; (iv) our need to retain or continue to recruit key performers; (v) the risk of a decline in the popularity of our brand of sports entertainment, including as a result of changes in the social and political climate;  (vi) the possible unexpected loss of the services of Vincent K. McMahon; (vii) possible adverse changes in the regulatory atmosphere and related private sector initiatives; (viii) the highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate and/or our inability to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence; (ix) uncertainties associated with international markets; (x) our difficulty or inability to promote and conduct our live events and/or other businesses if we do not comply with applicable regulations; (xi) our dependence on our intellectual property rights, our need to protect those rights, and the risks of our infringement of others  intellectual property rights; (xii) risks relating to the complexity of our rights agreements across distribution mechanisms and geographical areas; (xiii) the risk of substantial liability in the event of accidents or injuries occurring during our physically demanding events including, without limitation, claims relating to CTE; (xiv) exposure to risks relating to large public events as well as travel to and from such events; (xv) risks inherent in our feature film business; (xvi) a variety of risks as we expand into new or complementary businesses and/or make strategic investments; (xvii) risks related to our computer systems and online operations; (xviii) risks relating to privacy norms and regulations; (xix) risks relating to a possible decline in general economic conditions and disruption in financial markets; (xx) risks relating to our accounts receivable, which represent a significant portion of our current assets and relate principally to a limited number of distributors and licensees; (xxi) risks relating to our ability to access our revolving credit facility;  (xxii) potential substantial liabilities if litigation is resolved unfavorably; (xxiii) our potential failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, which could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock; (xxiv) through his beneficial ownership of a substantial majority of our Class B common stock, our controlling stockholder, Vincent K. McMahon, exercises control over our affairs, and his interests may conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock; (xxv) risks relating to the fact that our dividend exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits; (xxvi) a substantial number of shares are eligible for sale by Mr. McMahon and members of his family or trusts established for their benefit, and the sale, or the perception of possible sales, of those shares could lower our stock price; and (xxvii) risks related to the relatively small public  float  of our Class A common stock.  In addition, our dividend is dependent on a number of factors, including, among other things, our liquidity and historical and projected cash flow, strategic plan (including alternative uses of capital), our financial results and condition, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends (including under our revolving credit facility), general economic and competitive conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant.   Forward-looking statements made by the Company speak only as of the date made, are subject to change without any obligation on the part of the Company to update or revise them, and undue reliance should not b  e placed on these statements.

Evaluation of   Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Based on that evaluation, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .

Our management, including our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system s objectives will be met.  Further, because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changing in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PA    RT II. OTHER INFORMATION 

It    em 1.    Legal Proceedings 

On October 23, 2014, a lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the District of Oregon, entitled   William Albert Haynes III, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    This complaint was amended on January 30, 2015 and alleges that the Company ignored, downplayed, and/or failed to disclose the risks associated with traumatic brain injuries suffered by WWE s performers.  On March 31, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the first amended class action complaint in its entirety or, if not dismissed, to transfer the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  Without addressing the merits of the Company's motion to dismiss, the Court transferred the case to Connecticut on June 25, 2015.  The plaintiffs filed an objection to such transfer, which was denied on July 27, 2015.  On January 16, 2015, a second lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, entitled   Evan Singleton and Vito LoGrasso, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.  , alleging many of the same allegations as   Haynes  .  On February 27, 2015, the Company moved to transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut due to forum-selection clauses in the contracts between WWE and the plaintiffs and that motion was granted on March 23, 2015.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 22, 2015 and, following a scheduling conference in which the court ordered the plaintiffs to cure various pleading deficiencies, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on June 15, 2015.  On June 29, 2015, WWE moved to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety.   On April 9, 2015, a third lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California, entitled   Russ McCullough, a/k/a  Big Russ McCullough,  Ryan Sakoda, and Matthew R. Wiese a/k/a  Luther Reigns,  individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.  , asserting similar allegations to   Haynes  .  The Company again moved to transfer the lawsuit to Connecticut due to forum-selection clauses in the contracts between WWE and the plaintiffs, which the California court granted on July 10, 2015.  On September 21, 2015, the plaintiffs amended this complaint and, on November 16, 2015, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  Each of these suits seeks unspecified actual, compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief, including ordering medical monitoring.  The Haynes and McCullough cases purport to be class actions.  On February 18, 2015, a lawsuit was filed in Tennessee state court and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, entitled   Cassandra Frazier, individually and as next of kin to her deceased husband, Nelson Lee Frazier, Jr., and as personal representative of the Estate of Nelson Lee Frazier, Jr. Deceased, v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    A similar suit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entitled   Michelle James, as mother and next friend of Matthew Osborne, minor child, and Teagan Osborne, a minor child v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.   These lawsuits contain many of the same allegations as the other lawsuits alleging traumatic brain injuries and further allege that the injuries contributed to these former talents  deaths.  WWE moved to transfer the   Frazier   and   Osborne   lawsuits to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut based on forum-selection clauses in the decedents  contracts with WWE, which motions were granted by the respective courts.  On November 23, 2015, amended complaints were filed in   Frazier   and   Osborne  , which the Company moved to dismiss on December 16, 2015 and December 21, 2015, respectively.    On June 29, 2015, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U. S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled   World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. v. Robert Windham, Thomas Billington, James Ware, Oreal Perras and various John and Jane Does   seeking a declaration against these former performers that their threatened claims related to alleged traumatic brain injuries and/or other tort claims are time-barred.  On September 21, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, which the Company opposed.  The Court previously ordered a stay of discovery in all cases pending decisions on the motions to dismiss.  On January 15, 2016, the Court partially lifted the stay and permitted discovery only on three issues in the case involving Singleton and LoGrasso.  Such discovery was completed by June 1, 2016, and on March 21, 2016, the Court issued a memorandum of decision granting in part and denying in part the Company s motions to dismiss the Haynes, Singleton/LoGrasso, and McCullough lawsuits.  The Court granted the Company s motions to dismiss the Haynes and McCullough lawsuits in their entirety and granted the Company s motion to dismiss all claims in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit except for the claim of fraud by omission.  On March 22, 2016, the Court issued an order dismissing the Windham lawsuit based on the Court s memorandum of decision on the motions to dismiss.  On April 4, 2016, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the Court s decision not to dismiss the fraud by omission claim in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit and, on April 5, 2016, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the Court dismissal of the Windham lawsuit.  On July 21, 2016, the Court denied the Company s motion in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit and granted in part the Company s motion in the Windham lawsuit.  On April 20, 2016, the plaintiffs filed notices of appeal of the Haynes and McCullough lawsuits.  On April 27, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss the  

44

appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction, which motions were granted and the appeals were dismissed with leave to appeal upon the resolution of all of the consolidated cases.  The Company filed a motion for summary judgment on the sole remaining claim in the Singleton/LoGrasso lawsuit on August 1, 2016.  Lastly, on July 18, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, entitled   Joseph M. Laurinaitis, et al. vs. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and Vincent K. McMahon, individually and as the trustee of certain trusts  .  This lawsuit contains many of the same allegations as the other lawsuits alleging traumatic brain injuries and further alleges, among other things, that the plaintiffs were misclassified as independent contractors rather than employees denying them, among other things, rights and benefits under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), federal tax law, and various state Worker s Compensation laws.  This lawsuit also alleges that the booking contracts and other agreements between the plaintiffs and the Company are unconscionable and should be declared void, entitling the plaintiffs to certain damages relating to the Company s use of their intellectual property.  The lawsuit alleges claims for violation of RICO, unjust enrichment, and a  n accounting against Mr. McMahon  .    The Company and Mr. McMahon moved to dismi  ss this complaint on October 19, 2016.    The Company   believes all claims and threatened claims against the Company in these various lawsuits are being prompted by the same plaintiffs  lawyer and are without merit.  The Company intends to continue to defend itself against these lawsuits vigorously.  

On August 9, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled   Marcus Bagwell, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.    The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, C.G.S.  42-110a, et seq., principally arising from WWE s alleged failure to pay royalties for streaming video on the WWE Network.  On September 7, 2016, a motion for leave to amend was filed along with a proposed amended complaint that, among other things, seeks to add Scott Levy as an individual plaintiff and WCW, Inc. as a defendant. The Company believes all claims against the Company in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously.  

In addition to the foregoing, we are involved in several other lawsuits and claims that we consider to be in the ordinary course of our business.  By its nature, the outcome of litigation is not known, but the Company does not currently expect this ordinary course litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We may, from time to time, become a party to other legal proceedings.
