(1)   Nature of Business and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Nature of Business    Through its
wholly owned subsidiaries, GWG Holdings, Inc. owns a portfolio of life insurance contracts. As of the date of this report, our
portfolio had an aggregate fair value of $477.6 million. We earn income from changes in the fair value of our portfolio and through
the benefits we receive from the life insurance contracts we own. We are also involved in other lines of business, including a
business that collects commissions for facilitating the conversion of term life insurance contracts into universal, or permanent,
life insurance, and a business that participates in the merchant cash advance industry by advancing sums to merchants and lending
money to businesses that advance sums to merchants. Operating results for the three- and nine-month periods included in this report
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

GWG Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries
are incorporated and organized in Delaware. Unless the context otherwise requires or we specifically so indicate, all references
in these footnotes to  we,   us,   our,   our Company,   GWG,  or the
 Company  refer to GWG Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively and on a consolidated basis. References to
the full names of particular entities, such as  GWG Holdings, Inc.  or  GWG Holdings,  are meant to refer
only to the particular entity referenced. 

Use of Estimates    The preparation
of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts
of revenue during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions, which are based on current facts,
historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual results
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. The most significant estimates
with regard to these consolidated financial statements relate to (1) the determination of the assumptions used in estimating the
fair value of our investments in life insurance contracts, and (2) the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents    We
consider cash in demand deposit accounts and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with highly rated financial institutions. The balances in our
bank accounts may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. We periodically evaluate the risk of exceeding insured levels
and may transfer funds as we deem appropriate. 

Life Insurance Contracts    ASC
325-30,  Investments in Insurance Contracts  ( ASC 325-30 ), permits a reporting entity to account for its investments
in life insurance contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method. We elected to use the fair value method
to account for our life insurance contracts. Under the fair value method, we recognize our initial investment at the purchase price.
At each subsequent reporting period, we re-measure the investment at fair value in its entirety and recognize the change in fair
value as revenue in the current period net of premiums paid. We use the term  life insurance contracts  to have the
same meaning as  life insurance policies.  

We also recognize realized gain (revenue) from
a life insurance contract upon one of the two following events: (1) our receipt of notice or verified mortality of the insured;
or (2) our sale of the contract, filing of change-of-ownership forms and receipt of payment. In the case of mortality, the gain
(or loss) we recognize is the difference between the contract benefits and the carrying values of the contract once we receive
notice or verify the mortality of the insured. In the case of a contract sale, the gain (or loss) we recognize is the difference
between the sale price and the carrying value of the contract on the date of our receipt of sale proceeds. 

In a case where our acquisition of a contract
is not complete as of a reporting date, but we have nonetheless advanced direct costs and deposits for the acquisition, those costs
and deposits are recorded as  other assets  on our balance sheet until the acquisition is complete and we secured title
to the contract. On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a total of $34,000 and $31,000, respectively, of our  other
assets  comprised direct costs and deposits that we advanced for contract acquisitions.  

Other Assets    GWG acquired
the exclusive option to license  DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality  technology from the University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA). The technology was discovered by Dr. Steven Horvath and is featured in the September 2016 edition of Aging.
In 2013, Dr. Horvath reported that human cells have a mechanism that records biological aging progression based on DNA methylation
that is independent from chronological aging progression. In 2016, Dr. Horvath discovered a specific set of DNA methylation-based
bio-markers that are highly predictive of all-cause mortality. The discovery was made through a statistical analysis of bio-markers
found in DNA samples from over 13,000 individuals whose health had been studied for decades. The implications of Dr. Horvath s
discovery are simple and profound: A biostatistician can review a specific set of identified bio-markers and develop a highly predictive
analytical model of an individual s lifespan. The cost of entering into this exclusive option agreement is listed as  other
assets .

Deferred Financing and Issuance Costs   
Loans advanced to us under our senior credit facilities, as described in Notes 5 and 6, are reported net of financing costs, which
are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the facility.  The Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds,
as respectively described in Notes 7 and 8, are reported net of issuance costs, sales commissions and other direct expenses, which
are amortized using the interest method over the term of those borrowings. The Series A Preferred Stock, as described in Note
9, is reported net of issuance costs, sales commissions (including the fair value of warrants issued) and other direct expenses,
all of which were fully amortized using the interest method as of December 31, 2015. Selling and issuance costs of Redeemable
Preferred Stock and MCA Preferred Stock, described in Notes 10 and 11, are netted against additional paid-in-capital. 

Earnings (loss) per Share    Basic
earnings (loss) per share attributable to non-redeemable interests are calculated using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding
during the reported period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated based on the potential dilutive impact of our outstanding
Series A Preferred Stock, Redeemable Preferred Stock, warrants and stock options. 

Recently Adopted Pronouncements   
 On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), as part of its simplification initiative. ASU 2015-03
changes the presentation of debt issuance costs by presenting those costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related
debt liability. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. We  adopted ASU 2015-03   effective January
1, 2016, as required for public reporting entities. 

Reclassification 
         Certain 2015 amounts have been reclassified
to conform to ASU 2015-03, and that adoption reduced our assets, together with a  corresponding
reduction to our liabilities, by approximately $2,288,000 as of December 31, 2015. There was no impact on our statements of operations
in 2015, and  these reclassifications had no effect on our reported consolidated net income or loss for prior periods. 

(2)       Restrictions
on Cash  

Under the terms of our senior credit facilities
(discussed in Notes 5 and 6), we are required to maintain collection and escrow accounts that are used to fund the acquisition
of contracts, pay annual contract premiums, pay interest and other charges under the facility, and collect contract benefits. The
agent for the lender authorizes the disbursements from these accounts. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was a
balance of $15,688,000, and $2,342,000, respectively, in these restricted cash accounts. 

(3)      Investment
in Life Insurance Contracts  

Life insurance contracts are valued based on
unobservable inputs that are significant to their overall fair value. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded
as gain or loss on life insurance contracts, net of cash premiums paid on those contracts, in our consolidated statements of operations.
Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis that incorporates life expectancy assumptions derived from reports obtained
from widely accepted life expectancy providers, assumptions relating to cost-of-insurance (premium) rates and other assumptions.
The discount rate we apply incorporates current information about discount rate applied by other reporting companies owning portfolios
of life insurance contracts, the discount rates observed in the life insurance secondary market, market interest rates, our credit
exposure to the insurance companies that issued the life insurance contracts and management s estimate of the risk premium
a purchaser would require to receive the future cash flows derived from our portfolio as a whole. As a result of management s
analysis, discount rates of 11.07% and 11.09% were applied to our portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Reconciliation of gain on life insurance contracts: 

We currently estimate that premium payments
and servicing fees required to maintain our current portfolio of life insurance contracts in force for the next five years, assuming
no mortalities, are as follows: 

Management anticipates funding the premium payments
estimated above with proceeds from our senior credit facilities, proceeds from additional debt and equity financing, and proceeds
from maturities of life insurance contracts. The proceeds of these capital sources may also be used for the purchase, financing,
and maintenance of additional life insurance contracts.

(4)       Fair Value Definition
and Hierarchy  

ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC
820 ), establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability
used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including
the type of investment, the characteristics specific to the investment and the state of the marketplace, including the existence
and transparency of transactions between market participants. Assets and liabilities with readily available and actively quoted
prices, or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in an orderly market, generally will have a higher
degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. ASC 820 maximizes the use of
observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable inputs whenever available. Observable
inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained
from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions about how market participants price an asset
or liability developed based on the best available information. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. 

The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability
of inputs as follows: 

Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.   

Level 2 - Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.   

Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.   

The availability of observable inputs can vary
by types of assets and liabilities and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, whether an instrument
is established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent
that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value
requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for assets
and liabilities categorized in Level 3. 

Level 3 Valuation Process  

The estimated fair value of our portfolio of
life insurance contracts is determined on a quarterly basis by our portfolio management committee, taking into consideration changes
in discount rate assumptions, estimated premium payments and life expectancy estimate assumptions, as well as any changes in economic
and other relevant conditions. The discount rate incorporates (i) current information about discount rate applied by other reporting
companies owning portfolios of life insurance contracts, (ii) the discount rates observed in the life insurance secondary market,
(iii) market interest rates, (iv) our credit exposure to the insurance company that issued the life insurance contract and (v)
management s estimate of the risk premium a purchaser would require to receive the future cash flows derived from our portfolio
as a whole. 

These inputs are then used to estimate the discounted
cash flows from the portfolio using the Model Actuarial Pricing System probabilistic portfolio price model, which estimates the
cash flows using various mortality probabilities and scenarios. The valuation process includes a review by senior management as
of each valuation date. We also engage a third-party expert to independently test the accuracy of the valuations using the inputs
we provide on a quarterly basis. See Exhibit 99.1 filed herewith. 

The following table reconciles the beginning
and ending fair value of our Level 3 investments in our portfolio of life insurance contracts for the periods ended September 30,
as follows:

We periodically update the independent life
expectancy estimates on the insured lives in our portfolio, other than insured lives covered under small face amount contracts
(i.e., $1 million in face value benefits or less), on a continuous rotating three-year cycle.  Accordingly, we update life
expectancies for approximately one-twelfth of our portfolio each quarter. 

The following table summarizes the inputs utilized
in estimating the fair value of our portfolio of life insurance contracts: 

These assumptions are, by their nature, inherently
uncertain and the effect of changes in estimates may be significant. For example, if the life expectancy estimates were increased
or decreased by four and eight months on each outstanding contract, and the discount rates were increased or decreased by 1% and
2%, while all other variables were held constant, the fair value of our investment in life insurance contracts would increase or
(decrease) as summarized below:

Our wholly owned subsidiary GWG MCA Capital,
Inc. ( GWG MCA ) participates in the merchant cash advance by directly advancing sums to merchants and lending money,
on a secured basis, to companies that advance sums to merchants. Each quarter, we review the carrying value of these advances
and loans, and determine if an impairment reserve is necessary. At September 30, 2016, one of our secured loans to Nulook Capital
LLC was potentially impaired. The secured loan to Nulook Capital LLC had an outstanding balance of $3,215,000 and a loan loss
reserve of $400,000 at September 30, 2016. We deem fair value to be the estimated collectible value on each loan or advance made
from GWG MCA. Where we estimate the collectible amount to be less than the outstanding balance, we record a reserve for the difference.

(5)       Credit Facility   Autobahn Funding
Company LLC  

Through our subsidiaries GWG DLP Funding II,
LLC ( DLP II ) and GWG DLP Funding III, LLC ( DLP III ), we are party to a $105 million revolving senior
credit facility with Autobahn Funding Company LLC ( Autobahn ), with a maturity date of June 30, 2018. The facility
is governed by a Credit and Security Agreement (the  Agreement ), and DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank
( DZ Bank ) acts as the agent for Autobahn under the Agreement. On September 14, 2016, we paid off the revolving senior
credit facility in full with funds received from a new senior secured term loan with LNV Corporation as described in Note 6. 

Advances under the facility bear interest at
a commercial paper rate of the lender at the time of the advance, or at the lender s cost of borrowing plus 4.25%. We make
interest payments on a monthly basis. The effective rate of interest was 5.42% at September 14, 2016 and 5.58% at December 31,
2015. The weighted-average effective interest rate, after excluding an unused line fee, was 5.46% and 5.42% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 5.54% and 5.81% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The amount outstanding under this facility was
$0 and $65,011,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. GWG Holdings is a performance guarantor of the various
obligations of GWG Life, LLC ( GWG Life ), as servicer, under the Agreement. Obligations under the facility are secured
by our pledge of ownership in our life insurance contracts to DZ Bank through an arrangement under which Wells Fargo serves as
a securities intermediary. 

The Agreement has certain financial (as described
below) and non-financial covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

We have agreed to maintain (i) a positive
consolidated net income on a non-GAAP basis (as defined and calculated under the Agreement) for each complete fiscal year,
(ii) a tangible net worth on a non-GAAP basis (again, as defined and calculated under the Agreement) of not less than $45
million, and (iii) maintain cash and eligible investments of $15 million or above. Consolidated non-GAAP net income and
non-GAAP tangible net worth as of and for the four quarters ended September 30, 2016, as calculated under the Agreement, was
$33,877,000 and $149,361,000, respectively. 

Total funds available for additional borrowings
under the facility at December 31, 2015, was $39,989,000. At September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $0 and there were no
policies pledged to the facility. 

(6)       Credit
Facility   LNV Corporation  

On September 14, 2016, we entered into a senior
secured term loan with LNV Corporation ( LNV ) as lender through our subsidiary GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC ( DLP
IV ) as borrower. The facility is governed by a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ), with CLMG
Corp. ( CLMG ) acting as administrative agent on behalf of the lender under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement
makes available a total of up to $172,300,000 in credit with a maturity date of September 14, 2026. Additional quarterly advances
are available under the Loan Agreement. Interest will accrue on amounts borrowed under the agreement at an annual interest rate,
determined as of each date of borrowing, equal to (A) the greater of 12-month LIBOR or the federal funds rate (as defined in the
agreement) plus one-half of one percent per annum, plus (B) 5.75% per annum. Interest payments are made on a quarterly basis. 

At September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding
under this facility was $71,250,000 and total funds available for additional borrowing, net of required reserve, was $76,629,000.

Obligations under the facility are secured by
a security interest in DLP IV s assets, for the benefit of the lenders under the Loan Agreement, through an arrangement under
which Wells Fargo serves as security intermediary. 

The Loan Agreement requires DLP IV to maintain
a reserve account in an amount sufficient to pay 12 months of servicing, administrative and third party expenses identified under
the Loan Agreement, and 12 months of debt service as calculated under the Loan Agreement. As of November 10, 2016, the amount
set aside in the reserve account is $27,500,000. 

The Agreement has no financial covenants and certain non-financial
reporting covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016. 

(7)       Series
I Secured Notes   

Series I Secured Notes ( Notes )
are legal obligations of GWG Life and were privately offered and sold from August 2009 through June 2011. The Notes are secured
by the assets of GWG Life and are subordinate to obligations under our senior credit facilities (see Notes 5 and 6). We are party
to a Third Amended and Restated Note Issuance and Security Agreement dated November 1, 2011, as amended, under which GWG Life is
obligor, GWG Holdings is guarantor, and Lord Securities Corporation serves as trustee of the GWG Life Trust ( Trust ).
This agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Notes were sold with original maturity dates
ranging from six months to seven years, and with fixed interest rates varying from 5.65% to 9.55% depending on the term of the
Note. The Notes have renewal features under which we may elect to permit their renewal, subject to the right of bondholders to
elect to receive payment at maturity. Effective September 1, 2016, we no longer anticipate renewing the Notes. 

Interest on the Notes is payable monthly, quarterly,
annually or at maturity depending on the election of the investor. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted-average
interest rate of our Notes was 8.63% and 8.47%, respectively. The principal amount of Notes outstanding was $17,830,000 and $23,578,000
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The difference between the amount outstanding on the Notes and the carrying
amount on our balance sheet is due to netting of unamortized deferred issuance costs. Overall, interest expense includes amortization
of deferred financing and issuance costs of $82,000 and $275,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $49,000
and $260,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Future expected amortization of deferred financing costs is
$277,000 in total over the next six years.    

Future contractual maturities of Notes payable
and future amortization of their deferred financing costs at September 30, 2016 are as follows:

(8)       L Bonds  

Our L Bonds are legal obligations of GWG Holdings.
Obligations under the L Bonds are secured by the assets of GWG Holdings and by GWG Life, as a guarantor, and are subordinate to
the obligations under our senior credit facilities (see Notes 5 and 6). We began publicly offering and selling L Bonds in January
2012 under the name  Renewable Secured Debentures.  These debt securities were re-named  L Bonds  in January
2015. L Bonds are publicly offered and sold on a continuous basis under a registration statement permitting us to sell up to $1.0
billion in principal amount of L Bonds. We are party to an indenture governing the L Bonds dated October 19, 2011, as amended ( Indenture ),
under which GWG Holdings is obligor, GWG Life is guarantor, and Bank of Utah serves as indenture trustee. The Indenture contains
certain financial and non-financial covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. 

Effective September 1, 2016, we discontinued
the sales of 6-month and 1-year L Bonds. In addition, effective September 1, 2016, the L Bond interest rates changed to 5.50%,
6.25%, 7.50% and 8.50% for the 2-, 3-, 5- and 7-year L Bonds, respectively. The bonds have renewal features under which we may
elect to permit their renewal, subject to the right of bondholders to elect to receive payment at maturity. Interest is payable
monthly or annually depending on the election of the investor. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the weighted-average interest rate of our L Bonds was 7.16% and 7.18%, respectively. The principal amount of L Bonds outstanding
was $384,586,000 and $282,171,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The difference between the amount
of outstanding L Bonds and the carrying amount on our balance sheets is due to netting of unamortized deferred issuance costs and
cash receipts for new issuances in process. Amortization of deferred issuance costs was $2,073,000 and $5,362,000 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,892,000 and $4,232,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Future expected amortization of deferred financing costs as of September 30, 2016 is $11,622,000 in total over the next eight years. 

Future contractual maturities of L Bonds, and
future amortization of their deferred financing costs, at September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

(9)       Convertible Preferred Stock  

From July 2011 until September 2012, we privately
offered shares of Series A Preferred Stock ( Series A ) of GWG Holdings at $7.50 per share. In the offering, we sold
an aggregate of 3,278,000 shares for gross consideration of $24,582,000. Holders of Series A are entitled to cumulative dividends
at the rate of 10% per annum, paid quarterly. Dividends on the Series A are included as interest expense in the statements of operations.
Under certain circumstances described in the Certificate of Designation for the Series A, additional Series A shares may be issued
in lieu of cash dividends at the rate of $7.00 per share. 

Holders of Series A are entitled to a liquidation
preference equal to the stated value of their preferred shares (i.e., $7.50 per share) plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Holders
of Series A may presently convert each share of their Series A into 0.75 shares of our common stock at the rate of $10.00 per
share. 

As of September 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate
of 447,000 shares of Series A in satisfaction of $3,129,000 in dividends on the Series A, and an aggregate of 696,000 shares of
Series A were converted into 522,000 shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2016, we had 2,650,000 Series A shares outstanding
with respect to which we incurred aggregate issuance costs of $2,838,000, all of which is included as a component of additional
paid-in capital. 

GWG HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (unaudited) 

Purchasers of Series A in our offering received
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 431,954 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $12.50 per share. The grant date
fair value of these warrants was $428,000. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of these warrants were exercised,
and the weighted-average remaining life of these warrants was 0.68 and 1.43 years, respectively. 

In September 2012, we completed a public offering
of our common stock and, as a result, the Series A was reclassified from temporary equity to permanent equity. We may redeem Series
A shares under the Certificate of Designation at a price equal to 110% of their liquidation preference ($7.50 per share) at any
time. As of September 30, 2016, we have redeemed an aggregate of 277,000 shares of Series A. 

(10)       Redeemable
Preferred Stock  

Beginning November 30, 2015, we began publicly
offering up to 100,000 shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock ( RPS ) at $1,000 per share. Holders of RPS are entitled
to cumulative dividends at the rate of 7% per annum, paid monthly. Dividends on the RPS are included as interest expense in the
statements of operations. Under certain circumstances described in the Certificate of Designation for the RPS, additional shares
of RPS may be issued in lieu of cash dividends. 

The RPS ranks senior to our common stock and
pari passu with our Series A, and entitles its holders to a liquidation preference equal to the stated value per share (i.e., $1,000)
plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Holders of RPS may presently convert their RPS into our common stock at a conversion price equal
to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion, subject
to a minimum conversion price of $15.00 and in an aggregate amount limited to 15% of the stated value of RPS originally purchased
by such holder from us and   still held by such holder. 

Holders of RPS may request that we redeem their
RPS at a price equal to their liquidation preference at a price equal to their stated value plus accrued but unpaid dividends,
less an applicable redemption fee, if any. Nevertheless, the Certificate of Designation for RPS permits us to decline requests
for redemption in certain circumstances. Subject to certain restrictions and conditions, we may also redeem shares of RPS without
a redemption fee upon a holder s death, total disability or bankruptcy. In addition, after one year from the date of original
issuance, we may, at our option, call and redeem shares of RPS at a price equal to their liquidation preference. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had sold 33,201
shares of RPS for aggregate gross consideration of $33,177,000, and incurred approximately $2,399,000 of selling costs related
to the sale of those shares. 

(11)       GWG MCA Capital, Inc - 9% Preferred Stock  

 Beginning March 31, 2016, GWG MCA began privately
offering up to 2,000,000 shares of GWG MCA 9% Preferred Stock ( MCA Preferred ) at $10.00 per share. Holders of MCA
Preferred are entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 9% per annum, paid monthly. Dividends on the MCA Preferred are included
as interest expense in the statements of operations. As of September 30, 2016, a total of 7,155 shares of MCA Preferred had been
sold for aggregate gross consideration of $72,000 and approximately $7,000 of selling costs related to the sale of these shares
were incurred. 

Holders of MCA Preferred were redeemed as of
September 30, 2016 at the stated value of their shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends.

Taxes  

We had a current income tax liability of $0
as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The components of current and deferred income tax expense for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectfully, consisted of the following: 

We provided a valuation allowance against the
deferred tax asset related to a note receivable, which was charged-off for financial reporting purposes, because we believe that,
when realized for tax purposes, it will result in a capital loss that will not be utilized because we have no expectation of generating
a capital gain within the applicable carryforward period. Therefore, we do not believe that it is  more likely than not 
that the deferred tax asset will be realized.

The primary differences between the September
30, 2016 effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate are the accrual of non-deductible preferred stock dividend expense of
$2,153,000, state taxes, and other non-deductible expenses. The most significant temporary differences between GAAP net income
and taxable net income are the treatment of interest costs with respect to the acquisition of the life insurance contracts and
revenue recognition with respect to the mark-to-market of our life insurance portfolio. 

(13)       Common Stock  

In September 2014, we consummated an initial
public offering of our common stock resulting in the sale of 800,000 shares of common stock at $12.50 per share, and net proceeds
of approximately $8.6 million after the payment of underwriting commissions, discounts and expense reimbursements. In connection
with this offering, we listed our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol  GWGH.  

On June 24, 2015 we issued 60,000 restricted
common shares at $9.70 per share, determined by the closing market price on the date of grant, to a vendor as payment for services
to be rendered over three years. The cost of these shares is amortized over a 12-month period. On March 17, 2016, we issued an
additional 6,500 restricted common shares at an average price of $7.16 per share, determined by the closing market price on the
date of grant, to this same vendor for additional services provided to us. On April 25, 2016, we issued 25,000 restricted shares
of common stock at $6.25 per share, determined by the closing market price on the date of grant, to a vendor as a form of payment
for services the vendor is providing to us, which is expensed in the current period.

Incentive Plan  

We adopted our GWG Holdings 2013 Stock Incentive
Plan in March 2013. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors administers the plan. Incentives under the plan may be
granted incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options; stock appreciation rights; stock awards; restricted stock; restricted
stock units; and performance shares. Eligible participants include officers and employees of GWG Holdings and its subsidiaries,
members of our Board of Directors, and consultants. 2,000,000 common shares are presently issuable under the plan. 

Stock Options   Through September 30,
2016, we issued stock options for 1,237,000 shares of common stock to employees, officers, and directors under the plan. Options
for 687,000 shares have vested, and the remaining options are scheduled to vest over three years. The options were issued with
an exercise price between $6.35 and $10.18 for those beneficially owning more than 10% of our common stock, and between $6.00 and
$10.25 for all others, which is equal to the estimated market price of the shares on the date of grant using Black-Scholes binomial
option pricing model. The expected annualized volatility used in the Black-Scholes model valuation of options issued during the
period was 25.5%. The annual volatility rate is based on the standard deviation of the average continuously compounded rate of
return of five selected comparable companies over the previous 52 weeks. A forfeiture rate of 15% is based on historical information
and expected future trend. As of September 30, 2016, stock options for 415,000 shares were forfeited and stock options for 28,000
shares were exercised. 

Outstanding stock options: 

Compensation expense related to un-vested options
not yet recognized is $420,000. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over the next three years ($14,000 in 2016, $240,000
in 2017, $109,000 in 2018, and $57,000 in 2019). 

Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) - On September
19, 2016 we issued SARs for 145,388 shares of the common stock to employees. The strike price of the SARs was $8.76, which was
equal to the market price of the common stock at the close of business on September 19, 2016. 56,358 of the SARs were vested as
of September 30, 2016, on which date the market price of the common stock was $8.82. A forfeiture rate of 15% was used in calculating
our liability for the SARs. 

Outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights: 

A liability for Stock Appreciation Rights -
Compensation Expense was recorded on September 30, 2016 in the amount of $3,381 and Compensation Expense was charged for the same
amount. 

(15)       Net
Income per Common Share  

We have outstanding Series A, as described
in Note 9. The Series A are dilutive to our net income per common share calculation for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016. They are anti-dilutive for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and for both three and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2015. We also issued warrants to purchase common stock in conjunction with the sale of Series A (see Note
9). Both those warrants and our vested stock options are anti-dilutive for both three and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 and have not been included in the fully diluted net loss per common share calculation. We issued RPS (see Note 10).
The RPS is dilutive for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and anti-dilutive for the three-month period ended September
30, 2016.

We are party to an office lease with U.S. Bank
National Association as the landlord. On September 1, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our original lease that expanded the
leased space to 17,687 square feet and extended the term through August 31, 2025. Under the amended lease, we are obligated to
pay base rent plus common area maintenance and a share of building operating costs. Rent expenses under these lease arrangements
were $102,000 and $71,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $306,000 and $193,000 for the

(17)       Contingencies  

Litigation   In the normal course of business,
we are involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability resulting from such proceedings would
not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

(18)       Guarantee of
L Bonds  

We are publicly offering and selling
L Bond under a registration statement declared effective by the SEC, as described in Note 8. Our obligations under the L Bonds
are secured by substantially all the assets of GWG Holdings, a pledge of all the common stock held individually by our largest
stockholders, and by a guarantee and corresponding grant of a security interest in substantially all the assets of GWG Life. As
a guarantor, GWG Life has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the L Bonds. Substantially
all of GWG s life insurance contracts are held by wholly owned subsidiaries of GWG Life: DLP III, DLP IV and the Trust. GWG
Life s equity ownership in these subsidiaries serves as collateral for the L Bond obligation. The life insurance contracts
held by DLP III and DLP IV are not direct collateral for the L Bond obligations but do serve as direct collateral for the senior
credit facilities. 

The consolidating financial statements are
presented in lieu of separate financial statements and other related disclosures of the subsidiary guarantor and issuer because
management does not believe that separate financial statements and related disclosures would be material to investors. There are
currently no significant restrictions on the ability of GWG Holdings or GWG Life, the guarantor subsidiary, to obtain funds from
its subsidiaries by dividend or loan, except as provided herein. A majority of insurance contracts we own are subject to a collateral
arrangement with LNV described in Note 6. Under this arrangement, collection and escrow accounts are used to fund premiums for
the insurance contracts and to pay interest and other charges under the senior credit facility. 

The following represents consolidating financial
information as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, with respect to the financial position, and for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, with respect to results of operations and cash flows of GWG Holdings and its subsidiaries.
The parent column presents the financial information of GWG Holdings, the primary obligor for the L Bonds. The guarantor subsidiary
column presents the financial information of GWG Life, the guarantor subsidiary of the L Bonds, presenting its investment in DLP
III, DLP IV and the Trust under the equity method. The non-guarantor subsidiaries column presents the financial information of
all non-guarantor subsidiaries, including DLP III, DLP IV and the Trust.

in loan proceeds were obtained by DLP IV, of which approximately $16,250,000 was used to fund a reserve account required under
the Loan and Security Agreement. 

ITEM 2.   
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    

You should read the following discussion in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the information contained in other sections of
this report. This discussion and analysis is based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, our management. 

Risk Relating to Forward-Looking Statements   

This report contains forward-looking statements
that reflect our current expectations and projections about future events. Actual results could differ materially from those described
in these forward-looking statements. 

The words  believe,   could, 
 possibly,   probably,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,   expect, 
 may,   will,   should,   seek,   intend,   plan  or  consider,

from such statements. 

Such factors include, but are not limited to:  

changes in the secondary market for life insurance;   

our limited operating history;   

the valuation of assets reflected on our financial statements;   

the reliability of assumptions underlying our actuarial models;   

our reliance on debt financing;   

risks relating to the validity and enforceability of the life insurance contracts we purchase;   

our reliance on information provided and obtained by third parties;   

federal, state and FINRA regulatory matters;   

competition in the secondary market of life insurance;   

the relative illiquidity of life insurance contracts;   

our ability to satisfy our debt obligations if we were to sell our entire portfolio of life insurance contracts;

JOBS Act   

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company 
can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. This means that an  emerging growth company  can make an election to delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such
adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards at
the same time as other public reporting companies that are not  emerging growth companies.  This exemption will apply
for a period of five years following our first sale of common equity securities under an effective registration statement or until
we no longer qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined under the JOBS Act, whichever is earlier. 

Overview  

GWG Holdings, Inc. is a financial services
company participating in the life insurance secondary market. We create opportunities for consumers owning life insurance to obtain
significant value for their contracts as compared to the traditional options offered by insurance companies. We also create opportunities
for investors to participate in the life insurance alternative investment asset class, not correlated to traditional financial
markets. In so doing, we enable investors to take advantage of financial opportunities dominated by banks prior to the 2008 credit
crisis. 

We seek to build a profitable and large portfolio of life insurance assets that are well diversified in terms
of insurance companies and insureds. We believe that diversification is a key risk mitigation strategy to provide consistent cash
flows and reliable investment returns from our portfolio. To grow our portfolio and achieve diversification, we offer investors
the opportunity to participate in the yield potentially generated by our portfolio of life insurance assets through a variety
of financings and securities offerings. We believe we are well positioned to continue providing investors with yield participation
opportunities from the life insurance alternative asset class.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical Accounting Estimates   

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make judgments, estimates, and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on historical experience
and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these
estimates. We evaluate our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. We believe that
the judgments, estimates, and assumptions involved in valuing our investments in life insurance contracts have the greatest potential
impact on our consolidated financial statements and accordingly believe these to be our critical accounting estimates. Below we
discuss the critical accounting policies associated with these estimates as well as certain other critical accounting policies.

The fair value of our life insurance contracts
is determined as the net present value of the life insurance portfolio s future expected cash flows (contract benefits received
and required premium payments) that incorporates current life expectancy estimates and discount rate assumptions. 

We initially record our purchase of life insurance
contracts at the transaction price, which is the amount paid for the contract, inclusive of all external fees and costs associated
with the acquisition. The fair value of our investment in our portfolio of insurance contracts is evaluated at the end of each
subsequent reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our portfolio are based on periodic evaluations and are recorded in our
consolidated and combined statement of operations as changes in fair value of life insurance contracts.  

Fair Value Components   Medical
Underwriting   

Unobservable inputs, as discussed below, are
a critical component of our estimate for the fair value of our investments in life insurance contracts. We currently use a probabilistic
method of estimating and valuing the projected cash flows of our portfolio, which we believe to be the preferred and most prevalent
valuation method in the industry. In this regard, the most significant assumptions we make are the life expectancy estimates of
the insureds and the discount rate applied to the expected future cash flows to be derived from our portfolio. 

The Society of Actuaries recently finalized
the 2015 Valuation Basic Table ( 2015 VBT ). The 2015 VBT is based on a much larger dataset of insured lives, face
amount of contracts and more current information compared to the dataset underlying the 2008 Valuation Basic Table. The new 2015
VBT dataset includes 266 million contracts compared to the 2008 VBT dataset of 75 million. The experience data in the 2015 VBT
dataset includes 2.55 million claims on contracts from 51 insurance carriers. Life expectancies implied by the 2015 VBT are generally
longer for male and female nonsmokers between the ages of 65 and 80, while smokers and insureds of both genders over the age of
85 have significantly lower life expectancies. We adopted the 2015 VBT in our valuation process in June 2016. 

In September 2015, Equitable Life Insurance
Company ( AXA ) announced pending cost-of-insurance rate increases for certain universal life contracts which were
effected on March 1, 2016.  We identified 14 affected contracts in our portfolio. In April 2016, we received updated contract
illustrations from AXA and calculated the change in the fair value of our portfolio resulting from the increased premiums to be
a reduction of $2,395,000. This reduction was reflected in our balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. Our review of AXA s cost-of-insurance
rate increases is complete as of September 30, 2016. 

We are aware of additional pending cost of
insurance increases affecting approximately 1.1% of our portfolio by face amount of benefits. We will adjust our premium schedules
and resultant valuation when we have received the required information from the related carriers. 

Fair
Value Components   Required Premium Payments    

We must pay the premiums on the life insurance
contracts within our portfolio in order to collect the contract benefit. The same probabilistic model and methodologies used to
generate expected cash inflows from the life insurance contract benefits over the expected life of the insured are used to estimate
cash outflows due to required premium payments. Premiums paid are offset against revenue in the applicable reporting period. 

Fair Value Components   Discount
Rate   

A discount rate is used to calculate the net
present value of the expected cash flows. The discount rate represents the internal rate of return we expect to earn on investments
in a contract or in the portfolio as a whole at the stated fair value. The discount rate used to calculate fair value of our portfolio
incorporates the guidance provided by ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . 

The table below provides the discount rate used
to estimate the fair value of our portfolio of life insurance contracts for the period ending: 

The change in the discount rate incorporates
current information about discount rates applied by other reporting companies owning portfolios of life insurance contracts, discount
rates observed by us in the life insurance secondary market, market interest rates, credit exposure to the issuing insurance companies,
and our estimate of the risk premium a purchaser would require to receive the future cash flows derived from our portfolio of life
insurance contracts. Because we use the discount rate to arrive at the fair value of our portfolio, the rate we choose necessarily
assumes an orderly and arms-length transaction (i.e., a non-distressed transaction in which neither seller nor buyer is compelled
to engage in the transaction). The carrying value of contracts acquired during each quarterly reporting period are adjusted to
their current fair value using the fair value discount rate applied to the entire portfolio as of that reporting date.  

We engaged Model Actuarial Pricing Systems ( MAPS ),
to prepare a calculation of our life insurance portfolio. MAPS owns and maintains the portfolio pricing software we use. MAPS processed
contract data, future premium data, life expectancy estimate data, and other actuarial information to calculate a net present value
for our portfolio using the specified discount rate of 11.07%. MAPS independently calculated the net present value of our portfolio
of 625 contracts to be $477.6 million and furnished us with a letter documenting its calculation. A copy of such letter is filed
as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. 

Deferred Income Taxes   

Under ASC 740,  Income Taxes , deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is established
for deferred tax assets that are not considered more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets depends
upon having sufficient past or future taxable income in periods to which the deductible temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or within any applicable carryback or carryforward periods. After assessing the realization of the net deferred tax assets,
we believe that it is  more likely than not  that we will be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets other than
those which are expected to result in a capital loss. 

Deferred Financing and Issuance Costs   

Financing costs incurred under the senior credit
facilities were capitalized and are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the senior credit facilities. The
Series I Secured Note obligations are reported net of issuance costs, sales commissions, and other direct expenses, which are
amortized using the interest method over the term of each respective borrowing. The L Bonds are reported net of issuance costs,
sales commissions, and other direct expenses, which are amortized using the interest method over the term of each respective borrowing.
The Series A, as described in Note 9, was reported net of issuance costs, sales commissions, including the fair value of warrants
issued, and other direct expenses, which were amortized using the interest method as interest expense over a three-year redemption
period. As of December 31, 2015, these costs have been fully amortized.  Selling and issuance costs of RPS and MCA Preferred
Stock, described in Notes 10 and 11, are netted against additional paid-in-capital. 

Principal Revenue and Expense Items  

We earn revenues from the following three primary
sources. 

Life Insurance Contract Benefits Realized . We recognize the difference between the face value of the contract benefits and carrying value when an insured s
mortality event occurs. We generally collect the face value of the life insurance contract benefit from the insurance company within
45 days of recognizing the revenue.   

Change in Fair Value of Life Insurance Contracts . We value our portfolio investments for each reporting period in accordance with the fair value principles discussed herein, which includes the expected payment of premiums for future periods as shown in our consolidated financial statements net premium costs.   

Sale of a Life Insurance Contract . In the event of a sale of a contract, we recognize gain or loss as the difference between the sale price and the carrying value of the contract on the date of the receipt of payment on such sale.   

Our main components of expense are summarized
below. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . We recognize and record expenses incurred in our business operations, including operations related to the purchasing and servicing of life insurance contracts. These expenses include salaries and benefits, sales, marketing, occupancy and other expenditures.   

Interest
    and Dividends . We recognize and record interest expenses associated with the costs of financing our life insurance portfolio
    for the current period. These expenses include interest paid to our senior lender under our senior credit facilities, interest
    paid on our L Bonds and other outstanding indebtedness such as our Series I Secured Notes, and dividends on our Series A and
    our RPS. When we issue debt, we amortize the issuance costs associated with such indebtedness over the outstanding term of
    the financing, and classify it as interest expense.   

Results of Operations   Three and Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Same Periods in 2015   

The following is our analysis of the results
of operations for the periods indicated below.  This analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes. 

Revenue .  

(1)  
      The
    discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the portfolio of life insurance contracts we own was 11.07% as of both
    September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  The carrying value of contracts acquired during each quarterly reporting
    period is adjusted to current fair value using the fair value discount rate applied to the entire portfolio as of that
    reporting date (see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements).   

Expenses . 

(1)  
      We hired additional members to our sales, marketing, legal and information technology teams.  At the end of 2015 we employed approximately 50 employees, and at September 30, 2016 we employed approximately 67 employees.   
 
      (2)  
      The increase in the current period was due to the increase in our average debt outstanding.   
 
      (3)  
      Increase is due to SEC filings and other costs related to securities offerings and on-going compliance.   
 
      (4)  
      Increase is due to increased public relations, sales and marketing costs associated with growing and servicing our network of independent financial advisors.   

Income Tax Expense.   

The following table reconciles our income tax
expense at the statutory federal tax rate to our actual income tax expense:  

The
most significant temporary differences between GAAP net income and taxable net income are the treatment of interest costs with
respect to the acquisition of the life insurance contracts and revenue recognition with respect to the fair value of life insurance
portfolio. 

The primary permanent difference between our
effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate are the accrual of preferred stock dividend expense, state income taxes, and
other non-deductible expenses. The dividends charged to interest expense were $1.0 million and $0.5 million during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $2.2 million and $1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We finance our business through a combination
of life insurance contract benefit receipts, origination fees, equity offerings, debt offerings, and our senior credit facilities.
We have used our debt offerings and our senior credit facilities primarily for contract acquisition, contract servicing, and portfolio-related
financing expenditures including paying principal and interest. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we had approximately $117.2 million and $74.4 million, respectively, in combined available cash, cash equivalents, policy
benefits receivable, if any, and available borrowing base surplus capacity, if any, under our senior credit facilities for the
purpose of purchasing additional life insurance contracts, paying premiums on existing contracts, paying portfolio servicing expenses,
and paying principal and interest on our outstanding financing obligations. 

Debt Financings Summary   

We had the following outstanding debt balances
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Our total senior credit facilities and other
indebtedness balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $473.7 million and $370.8 million, respectively. At September
30, 2016, the total outstanding face amount of our Series I Secured Notes outstanding was $17.8 million, less unamortized selling
costs of $0.3 million, resulting in a carrying amount of $17.5 million. At December 31, 2015, the total outstanding face amount
of our Series I Secured Notes outstanding was $23.6 million, less unamortized selling costs of $0.3 million, resulting in a carrying
amount of $23.3 million. At September 30, 2016, the total outstanding face amount of L Bonds was $384.6 million plus $6.9 million
of subscriptions in process, less unamortized selling costs of $11.6 million resulting in a carrying amount of $379.9 million.
At December 31, 2015, the total outstanding face amount of L Bonds was $282.2 million plus $3.0 million of subscriptions in process,
less unamortized selling costs of $8.2 million resulting in a carrying amount of $277.0 million. 

The weighted-average interest rate of our outstanding
Series I Secured Notes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 8.63% and 8.47%, respectively, and the weighted-average
maturity at those dates was 1.31 and 1.06 years, respectively. The Series I Secured Notes have renewal features. Since we first
issued our Series I Secured Notes, we experienced $165.1 million in maturities, of which $125.0 million renewed for an additional
term as of September 30, 2016. This provided us with an aggregate renewal rate of approximately 76% for investments in these securities.
Effective September 1, 2016, we no longer renew the Series I Secured Notes. 

The weighted-average interest rate of our outstanding
L Bonds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 7.16% and 7.18%, respectively, and the weighted-average maturity at
those dates was 2.10 and 2.02 years, respectively. Our L Bonds have renewal features. As of September 30, 2016, $252.4 million
in aggregate principal amount of our L Bonds had matured since issuance, of which $168.3 million renewed for an additional term.
The aggregate renewal rate is approximately 67% for investments in these securities.  

Future contractual maturities of Series I Secured
Notes and L Bonds at December 31, 2016 are: 

The L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes are secured
by all of our assets, and are subordinate to our senior credit facilities. The L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes are pari passu
with respect to a security interest in our assets pursuant to an intercreditor agreement (see Notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated
financial statements).  

We maintain a $105 million revolving senior
credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank through DLP III. The revolving senior credit facility is used to pay the premium expenses
related to our portfolio of life insurance contracts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $0
million and $65.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the revolving senior credit facility, and maintained an available borrowing
base surplus of $76.6 million and $40.0 million, respectively. 

On September 14, 2016, we entered into a $172
million senior secured term loan with LNV Corp. through GWG Funding DLP IV. We intend to use the proceeds from this facility primarily
to grow and maintain our portfolio of life insurance contracts, for liquidity and for general corporate purposes. As of September
30, 2016 we had approximately $71.2 million outstanding under the senior credit facility. 

Capital expenditures have historically not been
material and we do not anticipate making material capital expenditures in 2016 or beyond. 

Corporate Financing History   

In November 2009, our wholly owned subsidiary
GWG Life offered Series I Secured Notes in a private placement to accredited investors only. This offering was closed in November
2011. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $17.8 million and $23.6 million, respectively, in principal
amount of Series I Secured Notes outstanding. 

In September 2011, we concluded a private placement
offering of Series A, having received an aggregate $24.6 million in subscriptions for our Series A. These subscriptions consisted
of $14.0 million in conversions of outstanding Series I Secured Notes and $10.6 million of new investments. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, we had approximately $19.8 million and $20.8 million stated value of Series A outstanding. 

In January 2012, we began publicly offering
up to $250.0 million in debt securities (initially named  Renewable Secured Debentures  and subsequently renamed  L
Bonds ) that was completed in January 2015. 

In September 2014, we consummated an initial
public offering of our common stock resulting in the sale of 800,000 shares of common stock at $12.50 per share and net proceeds
of approximately $8.6 million after the deduction of underwriting commissions, discounts and expense reimbursements. 

In January 2015, we began publicly offering
up to $1.0 billion of L Bonds as a follow-on offering to our earlier $250.0 million public debt offering. Through September 30,
2016, the total amount of these L Bonds sold, including renewals, was $637.1 million. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively, we had approximately $384.6 million and $282.2 million, respectively, in principal amount of L Bonds outstanding. 

In October 2015, we began publicly offering
up to 100,000 shares of our RPS at a per-share price of $1,000. As of September 30, 2016 we had issued approximately $33.2 million
stated value of RPS. 

Portfolio Assets and Secured Indebtedness    

At September 30, 2016, the fair value of our
investments in life insurance contracts of $477.6 million plus our cash balance of $18.8 million, our restricted cash balance
of $15.7 million and our life insurance contract benefits receivable of $6.1 million, totaled $518.2 million, representing an
excess of portfolio assets over secured indebtedness of $44.5 million. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investments
in life insurance contracts of $356.6 million plus our cash balance of $34.4 million and our restricted cash balance of $2.3 million,
totaled $393.3 million, representing an excess of portfolio assets over secured indebtedness of $22.5 million. The L Bonds and
Series I Secured Notes are secured by all of our assets and are subordinate to our senior credit facilities. The L Bonds and Series
I Secured Notes are pari passu with respect to a security interest in our assets pursuant to an intercreditor agreement. 

The following forward-looking table seeks to
illustrate the impact of the sale of our portfolio of life insurance assets at various discount rates in order to satisfy our debt
obligations as of September 30, 2016. In all cases, the sale of the life insurance assets owned by DLP III and DLP IV will be used
first to satisfy all amounts owing under the respective senior credit facilities. The net sale proceeds remaining after satisfying
all obligations under the senior credit facilities would be applied to L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes on a pari passu basis. 

The table illustrates that our ability to fully
satisfy amounts owing under the L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes would likely be impaired upon the sale of all of our life insurance
assets at a price equivalent to a discount rate of approximately 13.18% or higher. At December 31, 2015, the impairment occurred
at a discount rate of approximately 12.58% or higher. The discount rates used to calculate the fair value of our portfolio were
11.07% and 11.09% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The table does not include any allowance for
transactional fees and expenses associated with a portfolio sale (which expenses and fees could be substantial), and is provided
to demonstrate how various discount rates used to value our portfolio could affect our ability to satisfy amounts owing under our
debt obligations in light of our senior secured lender s right to priority payments. You should read the above table in conjunction
with the information contained in other sections of this report, including our discussion of discount rates included under the
 Critical Accounting Policies   Fair Value Components   Discount Rate  caption above. This discussion and
analysis is based on the beliefs of our management, as well as significant assumptions made by, and information currently available
to, our management. 

Cash Flows  

The payment of premiums and servicing costs
to maintain life insurance contracts represents our most significant requirement for cash disbursement. When a contract is purchased,
we are able to calculate the minimum premium payments required to maintain the contract in-force. As the insured ages, premium
payments increase (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements). Nevertheless, the probability of actually needing to
pay the premiums decreases as the probability of mortality increases. These scheduled premiums and associated probabilities are
factored into our expected internal rate of return and cash-flow modeling. Beyond premiums, we incur contract servicing costs,
including annual trustee, tracking costs, and debt servicing costs, including principal and interest payments, all of which are
excluded from our internal rate of return calculations. Until we receive a stable amount of proceeds from the contract benefits,
we intend to pay these costs from our senior credit facilities, when permitted, and through the issuance of debt securities, including
the L Bonds, and equity securities including our RPS. 

The amount of payments for anticipated premiums
and servicing costs (excluding debt servicing costs) that we will be required to make over the next five years to maintain our
current portfolio, assuming no mortalities, is set forth in the table below. 

For the quarter-end dates set forth below, the
following table illustrates the total amount of face value of contract benefits owned, and the trailing 12 months of life insurance
contract benefits collected and premiums paid on our portfolio. The trailing 12-month benefits/premium coverage ratio indicates
the ratio of contract benefits received to premiums paid over the trailing 12-month period from our portfolio of life insurance
contracts. 

We believe that the portfolio cash flow results
set forth above are consistent with our general investment thesis: that the life insurance contract benefits we receive will continue
to increase over time in relation to the premiums we are required to pay on the remaining polices in the portfolio. Nevertheless,
we expect that our portfolio cash flow results on a period-to-period basis will remain inconsistent until such time as we achieve
our goal of acquiring a larger, more diversified portfolio of life insurance contracts. As our receipt of life insurance contract
benefits increases, we expect to increasingly use these cash flows to begin paying down our outstanding indebtedness and purchase
additional life insurance contracts.  

Inflation  

Changes in inflation do not necessarily correlate
with changes in interest rates. We presently do not foresee any material impact of inflation on our results of operations in the
periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

GWG Holdings is party to an office lease with
U.S. Bank National Association as the landlord. Effective September 1, 2015, GWG Holdings entered into a second amendment to the
lease with U.S. Bank National Association (Second Amendment to Lease). The Second Amendment to Lease increases the office space
area to 17,687 square feet and extends the lease expiration date by approximately ten years (see Note 16 to our consolidated financial
statements). 

Credit Risk  

We review the credit risk associated with our
portfolio of life insurance contracts when estimating its fair value. In evaluating the contracts  credit risk, we consider
insurance company solvency, credit risk indicators, economic conditions, ongoing credit evaluations, and company positions. We
attempt to manage our credit risk related to life insurance contracts by generally purchasing life insurance contracts issued only
from companies with an investment-grade credit rating by Standard   Poor s, Moody s, or A.M. Best Company. See
 Portfolio Credit Risk Management  below. 

Interest Rate Risk  

Our senior credit facilities are floating-rate
financing. In addition, our ability to offer interest rates that attract capital (including in our continuous offering of L Bonds)
is generally impacted by prevailing interest rates. Furthermore, while our other indebtedness provides us with fixed-rate financing,
our debt coverage ratio is calculated in relation to our total cost of financing. Therefore, rising interest rates could materially
impact our business by increasing our borrowing costs, and reducing availability under our debt financing arrangements. Furthermore,
we calculate our portfolio earnings based upon the spread generated between the return on our life insurance portfolio and the
cost of our financing. As a result, increases in interest rates will reduce the earnings we expect to achieve from our investments
in life insurance contracts. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management
are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition
and operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures
used by other companies, including other companies within our industry. This presentation of non-GAAP financial information is
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see
our financial statements and related notes contained herein. 

We use non-GAAP financial measures for maintaining
compliance with covenants contained in our borrowing agreements and for planning and forecasting purposes. The application of current
GAAP standards during a period of significant growth in our business, in which period we are building a large and actuarially diverse
portfolio of life insurance, results in current period operating performance that may not be reflective of our long-term earnings
potential. Management believes that our non-GAAP financial measures permit investors to better focus on this long-term earnings
performance without regard to the volatility in GAAP financial results that can occur during this phase of growth. 

Therefore, in contrast to a GAAP fair valuation
(mark-to-market), we seek to measure the accrual of the actuarial gain occurring within the portfolio of life insurance contracts
at our expected internal rate of return based on statistical mortality probabilities for the insureds (using primarily the insured s
age, sex, health and smoking status). The expected internal rate of return tracks actuarial gain occurring within the contracts
according to a mortality table as the insureds  age increases. By comparing the actuarial gain accruing within our portfolio
of life insurance contracts against our adjusted costs during the same period, we can estimate, manage and evaluate the overall
financial profitability of our business without regard to mark-to-market volatility. We use this information to balance our life
insurance contract purchasing and manage our capital structure, including the issuance of debt and utilization of our other sources
of capital, and to monitor our compliance with borrowing covenants. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information
that is useful for investors to understand period-over-period operating results separate and apart from fair value items that could
have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on GAAP results in any particular period. 

Our senior credit facility with Autobahn/DZ
Bank requires us to maintain a  positive net income  and  tangible net worth,  each of which are calculated
on an adjusted non-GAAP basis using the method described above, without regard to GAAP-based fair value measures. In addition,
our revolving senior credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank requires us to maintain an  excess spread,  which is the
difference between (i) the weighted average of our expected internal rate of return of our portfolio of life insurance contracts
and (ii) the weighted average of our senior credit facility s interest rate. These calculations are made using non-GAAP measures
in the method described below, without regard to GAAP-based fair value measures. 

In addition, the Indenture governing our L Bonds
and the note issuance and security agreement governing our Series I Secured Notes require us to maintain a  debt coverage
ratio  designed to ensure that the expected cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance contracts is able to adequately
service our total outstanding indebtedness. This ratio is calculated using non-GAAP measures in the method described below, again
without regard to GAAP-based fair value measures. 

Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income . Our senior
credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank requires us to maintain a positive net income calculated on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We
calculate the adjusted net income by recognizing the actuarial gain accruing within our life insurance contracts at the expected
internal rate of return of the contracts we own without regard to fair value. We net this actuarial gain against our adjusted costs
during the same period to calculate our net income on a non-GAAP basis.  

(1)  
      Reversal of unrealized GAAP fair value gain of life insurance contracts for current period.   
 
      (2)  
      Adjusted cost basis is increased to include interest, premiums and servicing fees which are not capitalized under GAAP (non-GAAP cost basis).   
 
      (3)  
      Accrual of actuarial gain at expected internal rate of return based on the non-GAAP cost basis for the period.   
 
      (4)  
      We must maintain an annual positive consolidated net income, calculated on a non-GAAP basis, to maintain compliance with our revolving credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank.   

Adjusted Non-GAAP Tangible
Net Worth . Our revolving senior credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank requires us to maintain a tangible net worth in excess
of $45 million calculated on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We calculate the adjusted tangible net worth by recognizing the actuarial
gain accruing within our life insurance contracts at the expected internal rate of return of the contracts we own without regard
to fair value. We net this actuarial gain against our adjusted costs during the same period to calculate our tangible net worth
on a non-GAAP basis. 

(1)  
      Unamortized portion of deferred financing costs and pre-paid insurance.   
 
      (2)  
      Reversal of cumulative unrealized GAAP fair value gain on life insurance contracts.   
 
      (3)  
      Adjusted cost basis is increased to include interest, premiums and servicing fees, which are not capitalized under GAAP.   
 
      (4)  
      Accrual of cumulative actuarial gain at expected internal rate of return based the non-GAAP cost basis.   

Excess Spread . Our revolving senior credit
facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank requires us to maintain a 2.00%  excess spread  between our weighted-average expected
internal rate of return of our portfolio of life insurance contracts and the revolving senior credit facility s interest
rate. The expected internal rate of return on the portfolio is the rate of return the portfolio would earn if all future cash flows
occurred over time in proportion to the likelihood of their projected occurrence.  Expected future cash flows represent the
size of each potential payment (premiums and contract benefits), multiplied by the probability of that particular payment occurring. 
This calculation is known as the  probabilistic expectation  and it is based on actuarial estimations of life expectancy. 
For instance, a required premium payment of $10,000 might be projected for a given contract at a date five years from now. 
If there is a 50% chance of survival for the next five years, then that particular expected cash-outflow is calculated at $5,000. 
Similarly, if the contract benefit amount on the same contract is $1 million, then during the next five years, the probable expected
cash-inflow of contract benefits will total $500,000 with the other $500,000 projected to occur over the remaining life of
the insured. The rate of return generated by the net of all such future expected cash flows for the portfolio is thus the
expected IRR for the portfolio. 

A presentation of our excess spread and our
total excess spread is set forth below. Management uses the  total excess spread  to gauge expected profitability of
our investments, and uses the  excess spread  to monitor compliance with our borrowing. 

(1)  
      This represents the weighted-average expected internal rate of return of the life insurance contracts as of the measurement date based upon our non-GAAP cost basis of the insurance contracts and the expected cash flows from the life insurance portfolio.   

(A)  
      This represents the reversal of cumulative unrealized GAAP fair value gain of life insurance contracts.   
 
      (B)  
      Adjusted cost basis is increased to include interest, premiums and servicing fees which are not capitalized under GAAP.   
 
      (C)  
      This is the non-GAAP cost basis in life insurance contracts from which our expected internal rate of return is calculated.   

(2)  
      This is the weighted-average interest rate for both senior credit facilities as of the measurement date.   

(3)  
      Represents the weighted-average interest rate paid on all interest-bearing indebtedness as of the measurement date, determined as follows:   

(4)  
      Calculated as the weighted-average expected IRR (1) minus the weighted-average interest rate on interest-bearing indebtedness (3).   

Debt Coverage Ratio and Subordination Ratio.
 Our L Bond and Series I Secured Notes borrowing covenants require us to maintain a  debt coverage ratio  of less
than 90%. The  debt coverage ratio  is calculated by dividing the sum of our total interest-bearing indebtedness by
the sum of our cash and cash equivalents and the net present value of the life insurance portfolio. The  subordination ratio 
for our L Bonds is calculated by dividing the total interest-bearing indebtedness that is senior to L Bonds and Series I Secured
Notes by the sum of the company s cash and cash equivalents and the net present value of the life insurance portfolio. The
 subordination ratio  must be less than 50%. For purposes of both ratio calculations, the net present value of the
life insurance portfolio is calculated using a discount rate equal to the weighted average interest rate paid on all indebtedness.
As of the date of this report, the subordination ratio provisions under the Indenture have expired. 

As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance
with both the debt coverage ratio and the subordination ratio. 

Non-GAAP Expected Portfolio Internal Rate
of Return at Purchase.  The non-GAAP expected portfolio internal rate of return (IRR) at purchase is calculated as the weighted
average (by face amount of contract benefits) of the IRR expected at the time of purchase for all life insurance contracts in the
portfolio. This non-GAAP measure isolates our IRR expectation at purchase and utilizes our underwriting life expectancy assumptions
at the time. This measure does not change with the passage of time as compared to our non-GAAP cost basis that increases with the
payment of premiums, financing costs, and the effective life expectancy which changes over time, both of which are used to calculate
our expected portfolio IRR.   

We have in the past reported non-GAAP net asset
value among our other non-GAAP financial measures. We have determined, however, to cease reporting this measure primarily because
we do not believe that it is sufficiently additive to our existing non-GAAP measures in aiding users of our financial statements
and disclosures to measure and evaluate our financial condition or operating results. Moreover, we are not aware of other reporting
companies in our industry that use this measure to evaluate their financial condition or operating results. 

Portfolio Information  

Our portfolio of life insurance contracts, owned
by our subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, is summarized below: 

Life Insurance Portfolio Summary  

* Averages presented in the table are weighted
averages. 

Our portfolio of life insurance contracts, owned
by our wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, organized by the insured s current age and the associated number
of contracts and contract benefits, is summarized below: 

Distribution of
Contracts and Contract Benefits by Current Age of Insured  

Our portfolio of life insurance contracts, owned
by our wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, organized by the insured s estimated life expectancy estimates
and associated contract benefits, is summarized below: 

Distribution of Contracts by Current Life
Expectancies of Insured  

We track concentrations of pre-existing medical
conditions among insured individuals within our portfolio based on information contained in life expectancy reports. We track these
medical conditions within the following ten primary disease categories: (1) cancer, (2) cardiovascular, (3) cerebrovascular, (4)
dementia, (5) diabetes, (6) multiple, (7) neurological disorders, (8) no disease, (9) other, and (10) respiratory diseases. Our
primary disease categories are summary generalizations based on the ICD-9 codes we track on each insured individuals within our
portfolio. ICD- 9 codes, published by the World Health Organization, are used worldwide for medical diagnoses and treatment systems,
as well as morbidity and mortality statistics. Currently, the only primary disease category within our portfolio that represents
a concentration of over 10% is cardiovascular, which constitutes 21.25% of the value of our portfolio. 

Portfolio Credit Risk Management   

We rely on the payment of life insurance contract
benefit claims by life insurance companies as our most significant source of cash flow. The life insurance assets we own represent
obligations of third-party life insurance companies to pay face value of the life insurance contract benefits. As a result, we
manage this credit risk exposure by generally purchasing contracts issued by insurance companies with investment-grade ratings
from Standard   Poor s, and diversifying our portfolio among a number of insurance companies. 

As of September 30, 2016, 97.0% of our life
insurance contracts, by face value benefits, were issued by insurance companies that maintained an investment-grade rating (BBB-
or better) by Standard   Poor s. Our largest life insurance company credit exposures and their respective Standard  
Poor s credit rating of their respective financial strength and claims paying ability is set forth below: 

The yield to maturity on bonds issued by life
insurance carriers reflects, among other things, the credit risk (risk of default) of such insurance carrier.  We track the
yields on certain publicly traded life insurance company bonds as this information is part of the data we consider when valuing
our portfolio of life insurance contracts for our financial statements according to GAAP.  Also we believe that these yields
provide investors a market-based perspective on the financial strength of the largest life insurance companies backing our portfolio. 

The table above indicates the current yields
to maturity (YTM) for the senior bonds of selected life insurance carriers with durations, on average, that are similar to our
life insurance portfolio.  The average yield to maturity of these bonds was 3.02%, which, we believe, reflects in part the
financial market s judgement that credit risk is low with regard to these carriers  financial obligations. It should
be noted that the obligations of life insurance carriers to pay life insurance contract benefits is senior in rank to any other
obligation.  This  super senior  priority is not reflected in the yield to maturity in the table and, if considered,
would result in a lower yield to maturity all else being equal. As such, as long as the respective premium payments have been made,
it is highly likely that the owner of the life insurance contract will collect the insurance contract benefit upon the mortality
of the insured. 

The complete detail of our portfolio of life
insurance contracts, owned by our wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, organized by the current age of the insured
and the associated contract benefits, sex, estimated life expectancy, issuing insurance carrier, and the credit rating of the issuing
insurance carrier, is set forth below.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met. 

As of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the period covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management, under the supervision of and
with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework in   Internal Control Integrated
Framework .  Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of the evaluation date, we maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

Other than as noted below, there are no material changes
to the risk factors disclosed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

Accuracy of the life expectancy estimates and
mortality curves we use for small face contracts could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial
condition.   

As of September 30, 2016, we owned
306  small face  life insurance policies (i.e., a contract with $1 million in face value benefits or less) having
$164 million in face value of insurance benefits. The underwriting processes and mortality curves we use to evaluate, price and
purchase small face contracts may be different from, and, as a result, may not be as reliable as, the processes we use for life
insurance contracts with larger face values of benefits. While we obtain life expectancy reports from third-party evaluators based
on medical evidence, the processes used to develop these life expectancy reports are less extensive than traditional methods.
Although we have professional actuarial guidance in the use and application of mortality curves to price and value small face
contracts, the application of these mortality curves may not be as reliable as or more subject to adjustment than the processes
we use for larger face value of benefits. As the face value of our small face contracts increases relative to the size of our
total portfolio, the accuracy with which we have estimated life expectancies and mortality curves for these contracts will become
increasingly material to our business. Any shortcomings in the processes we have used to evaluate, price, purchase and value the
small face contracts we own could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Any
such outcomes would likely have a negative and possibly material effect on the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy
our debts. 

We may in the future rely, in part, on new and
unproven technology as part of our underwriting processes. If the mortality predictions we obtain through use of this technology
proves inaccurate, our results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.   

We recently exercised our option
to license, on an exclusive basis, new technology that we believe may be applied to assist us with the mortality predictions in
the course of underwriting and valuing life insurance contracts. This technology, however, has not yet been commercially applied
in the manner we envision, and it possible that we will be unable to elicit more accurate mortality predictions through its use.
It is also possible that the mortality predictions we obtain through the use of this technology will prove inaccurate, and perhaps
materially so. In such a case, our failure to accurately forecast mortalities could have a material and adverse effect on our results
of operation and financial condition, which could in turn materially and negatively affect the price of our common stock and our
ability to satisfy our debts. 

The technology we license may subject us to claims
of infringement or invalidity from third parties, and the magnitude of this risk to our business generally rises if and as we become
more successful in employing and relying on the technology. Any such claims would be complex and costly, and adverse outcomes could
undermine the competitive advantages we seek.   

Our reliance on technology will
subject us to the risk that other parties may assert, rightly or wrongly, that our intellectual property rights are invalid or
violate the rights of those parties, as well as the risk that our intellectual property rights will be infringed upon by third
parties. Any outcome that invalidates our intellectual property rights or that otherwise diminishes the competitive advantages
obtained, at least in part, through the use of those rights could have a material and adverse effect on our competitive position
and our prospects. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION  

Origination, Underwriting and Technology  

We focus on purchasing high quality life insurance
assets through our origination practices and underwriting procedures. In general, these practices and procedures strive to meet
published guidelines for rated securitizations of life insurance portfolios. At the same time, we seek innovative value-added tools,
services, and methodologies to improve both the accuracy and efficiency with which we evaluate and acquire life insurance assets. 

Since 2013, we have focused on developing our direct
origination channels through which we may purchase life insurance policies without the involvement of a life settlement broker,
thereby eliminating commission costs and timing delays in the acquisition. We expect to continue allocating considerable resources
towards developing our direct origination channels, primarily by outreach and relationship building with financial advisors (who
may also sell our investment securities), life insurance agents, and consumers. 

Our success in direct origination has presented us
with the opportunity to purchase a greater number of  small face  life insurance policies with a face value benefit
of $1,000,000 or less. We believe this opportunity is meaningful since the majority of life insurance policies outstanding are
small face policies, and policy diversification is critical in obtaining normalized actuarial performance. Historically, however,
small face policies have not been available to purchasers of life insurance contracts because the secondary market industry participants
have significantly relied on life settlement brokers who are paid a commission determined as a percentage of the face value benefit
of the purchased policy, to present purchase opportunities. Not surprisingly, because larger commissions are associated with larger
face value life insurance contracts, brokers have focused on larger contracts and the industry has developed origination practices
and underwriting procedures to accommodate such practices. As a result, the industry s traditional approaches to underwriting
and purchasing life insurance assets are ill suited for small face policies. For example, procuring complete medical records,
two separate life expectancy reports, and engaging in related activities, can be time consuming and expensive, and these same
costs cannot be justified when purchasing smaller life insurance assets. 

To more fully realize the potential of the direct origination
channel we have built, we have developed what we believe to be an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method of underwriting
and purchasing small face policies. In sum, our method is focused on obtaining enough medical information to generate reliable
life expectancy estimates, and thereby make informed purchase decisions. We expect to refine this process over time and, to the
extent possible, use new technologies to enhance this process and our overall business. 

To that end, we have recently announced
the execution of our option to exclusively license  DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality  technology from the
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and discovered by Dr. Steven Horvath. In 2013, Dr. Horvath reported that human cells
have a mechanism that records  biological age  progression, based on DNA methylation that is independent from  chronological
age.  In 2016, Dr. Horvath discovered a specific set of DNA methylation-based bio-markers that are highly predictive of all-cause
mortality. The discovery was made through a statistical analysis of bio-markers found in DNA samples from over 13,000 individuals
whose health was studied for decades. The implications of Dr. Horvath s discovery are simple and profound: Individual lifespans
can now be estimated with significantly greater precision. We intend to implement aspects of this technology in our underwriting
protocols and to explore how this technology may have commercial value to the primary life insurance, long-term care, and annuity
businesses.

Steven:  

You
have asked that we prepare a quarterly valuation of a GWG portfolio of life insurance settlements. The valuations were prepared
under the assumptions described below, which you provided in phone conversations and e-mails. We utilized the revised policy portfolio
data you provided on 10/12/2016 to project potential cash flows monthly following the  9/30/2016  valuation date, based on
the premiums and other values in the policy records provided.  

Data
Reliance    

In
preparing these valuations, we relied upon:  

Policy
                                         Data   We have relied on the portfolio data file as provided to us by GWG Life.
                                         This file and the policy data contained in it are assumed to have been prepared accurately
                                         and reflect current company supported product performance. The  09/30/2016  file
                                         had  625  policies with total face amounts of  $1,272,077,891 , a net increase
                                         of  78  policies and net increase of  $117,280,345  in face amount over the
                                         prior quarter. The  06/30/2016  file had  547  policies with total face amounts
                                         of  $1,154,797,546 .   

Future
                                         Premiums Data   We have relied on GWG Life s data regarding the future premiums
                                         to be paid on each policy. It is our understanding that GWG Life uses the MAPS software
                                         package along with data gathered from the actual premium payments to the life insurance
                                         carriers for each policy for projecting future minimum premium streams.   

Life
                                         Expectancy, Values, plus any adjustments   We have relied on the life expectancy
                                         values provided by GWG Life. It is our understanding that GWG Life obtained these LE
                                         values using the following industry experts: 21 st  Services, AVS Underwriting,
                                         EMSI, Fasano Associates, ISC Services and/or Predictive Resources.    

Results    

Using
the assumptions stated below, we calculated the net present values as of the valuation dates using the specified discount
rates of  11.07% and 7.10%.  These results will be e-mailed to you in the Excel reports generated, including a Portfolio
Summary and List of Policies, from the MAPS Portfolio valuation model.  

GWG
Portfolio as of 6/30/2016   

The
Expected Net Present Value is the probabilistic average value of the portfolio. These values are calculated actuarially;
assuming that the amount of premiums paid and death benefits received are proportional to the probabilities of survival.
Since death will occur at an unknown discrete point in time, the actual return for a policy, and a portfolio of policies, may
vary significantly from the Expected Value.  

Model Actuarial Pricing Systems, LP  

The
Stochastic analysis can return information about the range of values that might be achieved along with probabilities that the
results might be better or worse than the Expected or a specified level. The Stochastic analysis creates random scenarios where
a discrete date of death is independently projected for each life based on its mortality curve. The net present value of the portfolio
for each scenario is calculated as the present value of projected death benefits minus the present value of projected premiums.
The scenarios are ranked by value. The 95th Percentile Net Present Value is the portfolio value exceeded by 95% of the stochastic
scenarios. The 95% CTE is the Contingent Tail Expectation for the 95th percentile, and is the average of the 5% of scenarios with
the lowest net present value.  

The
valuations (1) do not include premiums paid before the valuation date, and (2) assume that the insured remains alive at the valuation
date. The valuations also assume that the policy COIs and policy expense charges remain at current levels in the future. If these
charges are increased, the projected values would decrease. The above values do not consider any federal income or other taxes.

Notice
on Mortality and Volatility    

Parties
engaged in life settlements commonly obtain and use  life expectancies  in their considerations. While life expectancies
are provided for individuals, they are developed from expected patterns of mortality of large groups of similar individuals. No
one knows exactly when any one individual will die, nor is a life expectancy intended to suggest the time until death will be
near the life expectancy. Any one individual may live much longer than his or her estimated life expectancy or that projected
by applying a mortality rating to any particular mortality table. Even for a large group of lives, the actual mortality for the
group may be less than expected for a variety of reasons (such as improvements in medical technology, unanticipated general mortality
improvement, or incorrect estimation of the life expectancy). Stochastic simulation and sensitivity testing can help to quantify
these risks, but such tests should not be interpreted as a guarantee of any particular financial outcome. Investors will earn
less than expected on the policy of any individual who lives longer than his life expectancy.
