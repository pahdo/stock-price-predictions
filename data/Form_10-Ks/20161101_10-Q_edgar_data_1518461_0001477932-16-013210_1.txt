Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements     For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)        (1) Organization and Basis of Presentation        Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of AmpliTech Group, Inc. ( Group  or the  Company ) have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.     The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC.       (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Accounting       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.       Principles of Consolidation       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers deposits that can be redeemed on demand and investments that have original maturities of less than three months, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company s cash and cash equivalents were deposited primarily in one financial institution.                 7       
      Table of Contents            AmpliTech Group, Inc.    Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)        Allowance for Doubtful Accounts       The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company s estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change in the future. An allowance of $0 has been recorded at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Depreciation and Amortization       Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.       Income Taxes       The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740   Income Tax  . ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.       Earnings (Loss) Per Share       Basic earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) are determined by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic EPS calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding under the treasury stock method. As of September 30, 2016 there were 39,814,831 potential dilutive shares that needed to be considered as common share equivalents.                 8       
      Table of Contents            AmpliTech Group, Inc     Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)        Inventory Obsolescence       Inventory quantities and related values are analyzed at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine those items that are slow moving or obsolete. An inventory reserve is recorded for those items determined to be slow moving with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. Inventory items that are determined obsolete are written off currently with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold.        Revenue Recognition       Revenues and costs of revenues are recognized during the period in which the products are shipped. The Company applies the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605-10, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ASC 605-10, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. ASC 605-10 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general, the Company recognizes revenue for sale of products when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability is reasonably assured.     The Company s sources of revenue are from the sale of various component amplifiers. Revenue is recognizes upon shipment of such products. The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects for 90 days after the sale of their product except for a few circumstances. There are no maintenance or service contracts related to any product sale.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.                 9       
      Table of Contents           AmpliTech Group, Inc     Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)        Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities       The Company s financial instruments consist of notes payable, loans payable and a derivative liability. The Company believes all of the financial instruments  recorded values approximate their fair values because of their nature and respective durations.     The Company complies with the provisions of ASC 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .  ASC 820-10 relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions.     ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions, about market participant assumptions, that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820-10 are described below:       Level 1.   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents are valued using inputs in Level 1.       Level 2.   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.        Level 3.   Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs rely on management's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances and may include the Company's own data.             AmpliTech Group, Inc     Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)         Application of Valuation Hierarchy       A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the Company assessed that the fair value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, customer deposits, notes payable, and due to officer approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature.      (3) Inventory      Inventory, which consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value). The inventory value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows:            (4) Property and Equipment      Property and Equipment with estimated useful lives of seven and ten years consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:           Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $21,645.            AmpliTech Group, Inc     Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements    For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Unaudited)       (5) Notes Payable      Notes Payable at September 30, 2016 includes an unsecured demand note executed on May 1, 2012, totaling $26,958 from one corporation with an interest rate of 8% per annum and a maturity date of October 31, 2012. Accrued interest related to this note was $9,475 and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,617.       (6) Line of Credit      On November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a commercial line of credit agreement and note for $150,000. This agreement will be paid over a three year term with monthly payments equal to 2.780% of the outstanding balance plus accrued interest. The initial variable interest rate on this agreement is 5.25% per annum. This interest rate may change every year on the anniversary date or change date to reflect the new prime rate in effect as per the Wall Street Journal plus 2%. The interest rate will never be greater than 25% or less than 5%. On April 20, 2016, the existing line of credit was increased from $150,000 to $250,000 with an extended maturity date of April 20, 2019.The outstanding balance as of September 30, 2016 was $59,737 and the interest paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,189.

Payments will be made for the amount demanded plus accrued interest on the unpaid balance through the demand date. As of September 30, 2016, the amount due to officer was $17,000. The Company repaid a net amount of $61,291 of principal and as September 30, 2016 accrued interest relating to this loan was $1,990.

Our products consists of Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assemblies designs. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on a time plus material basis.      Emerging Growth Company Status      We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an  emerging growth company,  we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies,  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory  say-on-pay  votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.     Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of:                   the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;                        the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering;                        the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and                        the date on which we are deemed to be a  large accelerated filer  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. We will qualify as a large accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700 million in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates and (ii) been public for at least 12 months. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.            The Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we may elect to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and such election is irrevocable if made. As such, we have made the election to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.             Results of Operations        For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015        Revenues      Sales increased by $265,055 or approximately 24%, when comparing sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,372,527 to sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,107,472. This increase was directly related to an increase in production capacity that resulted from more efficient outsourcing of assembly on a certain large foreign sales order.      Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit      Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased by $29,400 or 5% while gross profit increased by $235,655 or 42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is directly related to an increase in production capacity that resulted from more efficient outsourcing of assembly on a certain large foreign sales order with a higher gross margin.       General and Administrative Expenses      General and administrative expenses increased from $478,332 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $547,048 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $68,716 or approximately 14%. This increase primarily was due to relocation expenses incurred for the larger facility and the increase in marketing expenditures made by the Company to increase product line exposure and client base, both domestically and internationally. To date, the Company attended two trade shows, increased advertising in trade publications and redesigned its website.      Income (Loss) From Operations        As a result of the above, the Company had net income from operations of $249,925 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net income from operations of $82,986 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an overall increase of $166,939.      Other Income (Expenses)        Interest expense decreased from $27,217 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $12,890 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $14,327 or approximately 53%. The decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of the factoring agreement to a line of credit with a significantly lower interest rate.             For The Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015        Revenues      Sales increased by $341,249 or approximately 90%, when comparing sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $721,482 to sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $380,233. This increase was directly related to an increase in production capacity that resulted from more efficient outsourcing of assembly on a certain large foreign sales order.      Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit      Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased by $97,771 or 46% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is directly related to an increase in production and outsourcing of assembly on a certain large foreign sales order with a higher gross margin. This resulted in a corresponding 145% increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales, or $243,478 when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2016 gross profit of $411,720, to the three months ended September 30, 2015 gross profit of $168,242.       General and Administrative Expenses      General and administrative expenses increased from $144,892 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $168,086 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $23,194. The increase is attributable primarily to an additional trade show that the Company attended in the Northeast region and to the additional costs associated with the relocation.      Income (Loss) From Operations        As a result of the above, the Company had net income from operations of $243,634 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income from operations of $23,350 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $220,284 or 943%.        Other Income (Expenses)        Interest expense decreased from $7,844 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $4,428 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $3,416. The decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of the factoring agreement to a line of credit with a significantly lower interest rate.              Liquidity and Capital Resources        We have historically financed our operations by the issuance of debt from third party lenders, notes issued to various private individuals and personal funds advanced from time to time by the majority shareholder, who is also the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.     As of September 30, 2016, we had $192,170 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $49,035 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 we had a working capital surplus of $44,876 and $288,901 respectively. We had a stockholders  equity of $141,123 and $378,158 as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively.     Net cash provided by operating activities was $221,385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting primarily to the decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in customer deposits. The net cash used in investing activities was $14,335 to purchase lab equipment. The net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $63,915 which results primarily from the repayment of the officer s loan and the line of credit.     We intend to finance our internal growth with cash on hand, cash provided from operations, borrowings from the line of credit of up to $250,000, debt or equity offerings, or some combination thereof. We believe that our cash provided from operations and cash on hand will provide sufficient working capital to fund our operations for the next twelve months.       Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions      The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management's view, most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates.     The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the salability and recoverability of inventory, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes there have been no significant changes during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, to the items disclosed as critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      We cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary.        Off Balance Sheet Transactions      None.             Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .      Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.     Based on the evaluation as of September 30, 2016 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There were no changes that have affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report.               PART II     OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       To the best of our knowledge, there are no pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.       Item 1A. Risk Factors.       Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       None.       Item 3.
