PART I

ITEM 1.  
 
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

This Form 10-Q does not contain Financial Statements or Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations because we have not completed the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended October 31, 2016.  We will amend this Form 10-Q as soon as we have prepared the required financial statements and the same have been reviewed by our auditors as required by Item 8.03 of Reg. S-X.

ITEM 2.  
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This Form 10-Q does not contain Financial Statements or Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations because we have not completed the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended October 31, 2016.  We will amend this Form 10-Q as soon as we have prepared the required financial statements and the same have been reviewed by our auditors as required by Item 8.03 of Reg. S-X.

ITEM 3.  
 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM 4.  
 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. As of October 31, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was because we did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions.  As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate review of financial information, particularly our lack of a sufficient number of accounting staff with experience in public company SEC reporting and technical expertise. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The aforementioned material weakness was identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the period ended October 31, 2016.

Management of the company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the company's accounting staff.  The small size of the company's accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.  To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting professionals.  As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.
