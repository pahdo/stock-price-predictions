OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    

1. General 
    
  In these unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Occidental has made its disclosures in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as they apply to interim reporting, and condensed or omitted, as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations, certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements and the notes. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Occidental s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the opinion of Occidental s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present Occidental s consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as applicable. The income and cash flows for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are not necessarily indicative of the income or cash flows to be expected for the full year. 

2. Asset Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other  
    
  In September 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties for $63 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $59 million.  
    
  In September 2016, Occidental sought government approvals to sell its operations in Libya. Occidental recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $112 million to write down the value of its Libya operations.   
    
  In August 2016, Occidental terminated crude oil supply agreements at a cost of $160 million.  
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, Occidental received $330 million as final payment from the settlement with the Republic of Ecuador. In January 2016, Occidental reached an understanding on the terms of payment for the approximate $1.0 billion payable to Occidental by the Republic of Ecuador under a November 2015 International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes arbitration award.  This award relates to Ecuador's 2006 expropriation of Occidental's Participation Contract for Block 15.  Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain of $681 million in the first quarter of 2016. The results related to Ecuador were presented as discontinued operations. 
    
  In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior note offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016. 
    
  In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016. Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and will use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
    
  In March 2016, Occidental distributed its remaining shares of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) through a special stock dividend to stockholders of record as of February 29, 2016. Upon distribution, Occidental recorded a $78 million loss to reduce the investment to its fair market value, and Occidental no longer owns any shares of California Resources common stock.  
    
  In March 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for $153 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $121 million.  The assets and liabilities related to these operations were presented as held for  

7 

sale at December 31, 2015, and primarily included property, plant and equipment and current accrued liabilities and asset retirement obligations.   
    
  In February 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that matured.        
    
  In January 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Occidental Tower building in Dallas, Texas, for net proceeds of approximately $85 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $57 million. The building was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. 

3. Accounting and Disclosure Changes 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance related to the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
    
  In March, April, and May of 2016, the FASB issued updates clarifying several aspects of the new revenue recognition standard, previously issued in May 2014. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. These rules are designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting and cash flow classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (2) forfeitures, and (3) tax withholding requirements and cash flow classification. The rules were adopted for the second quarter of 2016 and did not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to eliminate the requirement to retrospectively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued rules clarifying that a change in one of the parties to a derivative contract that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require dedesignation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued rules in which lessees will recognize most leases, including operating leases, on-balance sheet.  These new rules will significantly increase reported assets and liabilities.  The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued rules simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new rules require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  Occidental adopted these rules retrospectively as of January 1, 2016. The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.   

4. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
    
  Occidental paid foreign, state and federal income taxes of $442 million and $848 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the first nine months of 2016, Occidental received federal income tax refunds of $302 million as a result of the carryback of net operating losses generated in 2015. Interest paid totaled  $224 million and $198 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

5. Inventories 
    
  A portion of inventories is valued under the LIFO method.  The valuation of LIFO inventory for interim periods is based on Occidental s estimates of year-end inventory levels and costs. Inventories as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , consisted of the following (in millions): 

6. Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures 
    
  Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.   
    
  The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.  OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.  Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.  These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 150 sites.  The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of   September 30, 2016  , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($78 million) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities   other ($342 million).  The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites   third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded   $10 million   each at 13 of the 150 sites described above, and 97 of the sites each had reserves of $1 million or less.  Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next   three   to   four   years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent   10   or more years.   

9 

Due to uncertainties surrounding the Maxus indemnified sites described further under Note 7,   Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies  , Occidental is currently unable to estimate an amount of reasonably possible losses associated with certain sites.  For all other sites, Occidental believes its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $415 million.  For additional information regarding environmental matters, refer to Note 7.  

7. Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.  Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.  These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.  Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.   
    
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.  In Note 6, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria. Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation, that satisfy this criteria as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental s consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.  
    
  Environmental Litigation 
    
  When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site along a portion of the Passaic River.  On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware.  Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site. Occidental has been pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of Maxus, to recover all indemnified costs, which will include costs to be incurred at the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site.  
    
  In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.  The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.   
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million.  The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan pursuant to the AOC.  Occidental s allocable share of this liability may ultimately be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to Occidental s pursuit of its indemnity rights against Maxus.  Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.   

10 

Reserves have not been accrued for Occidental's potential obligations for the remediation costs for the cleanup of the Lower Passaic River (other than its estimated allocable share of the design costs under the AOC) and for other Maxus-indemnified sites as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time for several reasons including, but not limited to, the existence of other potentially responsible parties, the presence of contaminants of concern that are not associated with DSCC or Occidental's operations, the inherent uncertainties in estimating clean-up costs and the corrective actions that may be required.  Occidental continues to evaluate the costs involved for Maxus-indemnified sites, including the costs involved in the cleanup of the Lower Passaic River as the design phase and other activities proceed. 
    
  Tax Matters 
    
  During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS review. Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Indemnities to Third Parties  
    
  Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.  These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.  As of September 30, 2016, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves. 

8. Retirement and Post-retirement Benefit Plans 
    
  The following tables set forth the components of the net periodic benefit costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

11 

Occidental contributed approximately zero and $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  , respectively, and approximately $2 million and $7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to its defined benefit plans.  

9. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1   using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2   using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3   using unobservable inputs.  Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period. 
    
  Fair Values   Recurring 
    
  Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.  For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods: 

Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.   O  ccidental values its available for sale investment based on the common stock closing share price as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives and investments are classified as Level 1. 
                
    Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  
                
    Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions, and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. 
       
  Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when observable inputs are unavailable. This approach utilizes management s judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate. 

12 

The following tables provide fair value measurement information for such assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

Fair Values   Nonrecurring 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Occidental did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The following table provides fair value measurement for such proved domestic and international oil and gas properties that are measured on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2015. The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows. These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves as of balance sheet date and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs, and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8 to 20 percent. These properties were impacted by persistently low worldwide oil and natural gas prices and changing development plans. Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Other Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and other on-balance-sheet financial instruments, other than long-term fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value.  The cost, if any, to terminate Occidental's off-balance-sheet financial instruments is not significant.  Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments  maturities.  The estimated fair value of Occidental s debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $9.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, and its carrying value net of unamortized discount as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $8.3 billion. The majority of Occidental's debt is classified as Level 1, with $68 million classified as Level 2. 

10. Derivatives 
    
  Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.  Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.  Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period. 
    
  Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to obtain average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.  Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does, the volumes are usually insignificant. 
    
  Cash-Flow Hedges 
    
  Occidental's marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental's North American leased storage facilities.  Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas.  As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas. The following table summarizes Occidental s other comprehensive income related to derivatives for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

14 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  The following table summarizes Occidental s net volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

Occidental fulfills short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial portion of the short positions outstanding at quarter end and has sufficient production capacity and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.  
    
  Approximately $9 million of net gains and $119 million of net losses from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Approximately $35 million of net gains and $163 million of net losses from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.  Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $32 million and $3 million deposited by Occidental has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (d) 
    As of   December 31, 2015  , collateral received of $14 million has been netted against derivative assets, and collateral paid of $4 million has been netted against derivative liabilities. 
       
  See Note 9,   Fair Value Measurements,   for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives. 

16 

Credit Risk 
    
  The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate. Occidental actively reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties and monitors credit exposures against assigned credit limits by adjusting credit limits to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary. Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis. 
  Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post. Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

11. Industry Segments 
    
  Occidental conducts its operations through   three   segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing.  The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.  The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.  The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO   2    and power.  It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  
    
  Results of industry segments generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and income from the segments' equity investments.  Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions. 

17 

The following tables present Occidental s industry segments (in millions):   

(a) 
    The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include pre-tax impairment charges of $112 million related to Occidental's Libya operations and $160 million related to terminated crude oil supply contracts partially offset by pre-tax gains of $59 million on the sale of South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties.  The nine months ended   September 30, 2016   also reflected a $121 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Occidental's Piceance Basin operations in Colorado.   
              (b) 
    Includes unallocated net interest expense, administration expense, environmental remediation and other pre-tax items. 
              (c) 
    Includes all foreign and domestic income taxes from continuing operations. 
              (d) 
    The three months ended September 30, 2015 includes pre-tax impairment charges of $3.1 billion. In September 2015, Occidental entered into a sales agreement to sell its Williston operations in North Dakota, and as such an impairment charge of $756 million was recorded to write down the net book value of the assets and liabilities held for sale to the sales price. Due to the significant decline in oil and gas futures prices, Occidental also recorded impairment charges on proved and unproved properties related to Occidental's domestic gas operations of $924 million, Iraq operations of $760 million and Libya operations of $676 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also reflected first quarter impairment charges of $195 million for Occidental's South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties and $41 million to write-off the remaining investment in Yemen due to the collapse of the country's government. 
              (e) 
    The nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include gains on sale of the Occidental Tower and Indspec for $88 million and an idled chemical site for $98 million, respectively.  

18 

12. Earnings Per Share 
    
  Occidental s instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, net income allocated to these participating securities has been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method. 
    
  Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.  The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards. 
    
  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions, except per-share amounts): 

13. Subsequent Event 
    
  In October 2016, Occidental acquired producing and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin.  This acquisition includes 35,000 net acres in Reeves and Pecos counties, Texas in the Southern Delaware Basin, in areas where Occidental currently operates or has working interests. Separately, Occidental also acquired working interests in several producing oil and gas CO   2    floods and related EOR infrastructure, increasing Occidental's ownership in several properties where it is currently the operator or an existing working interest partner. The total purchase price for these transactions is approximately $2.0 billion, which Occidental funded from existing cash on hand.

Material risks that may affect Occidental s results of operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  of Occidental's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K).  

Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  Occidental reported a net loss from continuing operations of $238 million for the third quarter of 2016 on net sales of $2.6 billion, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $2.6 billion on net sales of $3.1 billion for the third quarter of 2015.  The net losses for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 included asset impairments and related charges of $221 million and $3.4 billion, respectively. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.31 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to diluted loss of $3.41 per share for the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Occidental reported a net loss from continuing operations of $734 million for the first nine months of 2016 on net sales of $7.3 billion, compared to a net loss of $2.6 billion on net sales of $9.7 billion for the same period in 2015.  The net losses for the nine months ended September 2016 and 2015 included asset impairment and related items charges of $299 million and $3.7 billion, respectively. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.96 per share for the first nine months of 2016, compared to a loss per share of $3.45 for the same period of 2015. Gain from discontinued operations was $432 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with a loss of $10 million for the same period of 2015.  
    
  Excluding asset impairment and related items charges, net losses from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, mainly reflected lower realized oil prices and sales volumes. To a lesser extent, net losses from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2016 also reflected lower chemical sales prices and volumes, and lower midstream domestic pipeline income.  
    
  Selected Statements of Operations Items 
    
  Net sales decreased for the   three   and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to lower oil prices and sales volumes.  Gain on disposal of assets, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflect gains on the sale of the Piceance Basin operations in Colorado of $121 million, the Occidental Tower building in Dallas of $57 million and South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties of $59 million. 
    
  Compared to the same periods in 2015, cost of sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected lower oil and gas production costs, mainly from maintenance and support activities. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected lower raw material and energy costs for the chemical business.   

20 

Asset impairments and related items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflected an impairment charge of $112 million related to Libya and a crude oil supply agreement termination charge of $160 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected impairment charges of $78 million related to the special stock dividend of California Resources shares. Asset impairments and related items in the Oil and Gas segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflected impairment charges of $3.1 billion, which included $763 million to write down the net book value of the Williston operations and impairment charges related to Occidental's domestic gas operations of $924 million, Iraq operations of $760 million and Libya operations of $676 million due to the decline in oil and gas futures prices. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also reflected first quarter impairment charges of $195 million for Occidental's South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties and $41 million to write-off the remaining investment in Yemen due to the collapse of the country's government. 
    
  Taxes other than on income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower production and ad valorem taxes, due to lower oil and gas prices and the sale of the Williston operation.  
    
  Higher interest and debt expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower capitalized interest and an additional six months interest expense related to  the $750 million 3.50-percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750 million of 4.625-percent senior unsecured notes due 2045 issued in June 2015. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected a premium charge on the early retirement in May 2016 of the $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due February 2017. 
    
  The domestic and foreign income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower pre-tax operating losses in   2016   compared to   2015  . The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected the relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks. 
    
  Selected Analysis of Financial Position 
    
  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.   
    
  The increase in trade receivables, net, at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015, was due to an increase in oil and gas realized prices. The decrease in assets held for sale and available for sale investment reflect the sale of Piceance operations in Colorado and the Occidental Tower in Dallas, and the distribution of Occidental's remaining California Resources common stock to its shareholders. The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is primarily a result of capital contributions associated with the joint venture for the ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.  The decrease in property, plant and equipment, net, is primarily the result of $3.2 billion of DD A, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.8 billion.  
    
  Current maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2016, decreased from December 31, 2015, due to the payments of $700 million 2.5-percent senior notes due February 2016 and $750 million 4.125-percent senior notes due June 2016. The increase in long-term debt, net since December 31, 2015 is the result of the issuance of $2.75 billion of senior notes in April 2016, partially offset by the early redemption in May 2016 of $1.25 billion 1.75-percent senior notes due February 2017.  
    
  The increase in accounts payable at September 30, 2016, is due to higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter 2016 compared to year-end 2015. Liabilities of assets held for sale as of September 30, 2016, decreased due to the sale of Piceance operations in Colorado.  

21 

Segment Operations 
    
  Occidental conducts its operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO   2    and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.  Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  
    
  The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in millions): 

(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions. 
  (b) Refer to  Significant Transactions and Events Affecting Earnings,   Oil and Gas Segment,   Chemical Segment,   Midstream and Marketing  Segment  and "Corporate" discussions that follow. 

22 

Significant Transactions and Events Affecting Earnings 
    
  The following table sets forth significant transactions and events that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount, affecting Occidental s earnings for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in millions): 

(a) The nine months ended September 30, 2016 amount included benefits for the relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks.  
  (b) Amounts shown after tax. 

23 

Worldwide Effective Tax Rate 
    
  T  he following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate of 31 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is higher than the comparative period of 2015 due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income, as well as the current year domestic tax benefit associated with the relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks and oil and gas asset impairments recorded in 2015. Excluding the impact of asset sales and other nonrecurring items, Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would be 28 percent.  

24 

Oil and Gas Segment 
    
  The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for the three  and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where the product is loaded onto tankers. 
   
 (See footnote following the table below)  

25 

The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of ongoing operations for oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for the three  and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , this excludes operations sold, exited or exiting.   

Note  : MBBL represents thousand barrels. MMCF represents million cubic feet.   
  (a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) based on energy content of six million cubic feet (MMCF) of gas to one thousand barrels of oil (MBOE). Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  
  (b) Excludes 16 MBBL, 3 MBBL and 76 MMCF of oil, NGLs and gas for the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to Williston and Piceance. Excludes 1 MBBL of NGLs and 14 MMCF of gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to Piceance and 17 MBBL, 3 MBBL and 81 MMCF of oil, NGLs, and gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, related to Williston and Piceance.  
  (c) Excludes 39 MMBL and 242 MMCF of oil and gas for the three months ended September 30, 2015, related to Bahrain and Iraq. Excludes 9 MBBL and 151 MMCF of oil and gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 36 MMBL and 242 MMCF of oil and gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, related to Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.  
  (d)  Excludes 17 MMBL and 242 MMCF of oil and gas for the three months ended September 30, 2015, related to Bahrain and Iraq. Excludes 9 MBBL and 151 MMCF of oil and gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 27 MMBL and 242 MMCF of oil and gas for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, related to Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.  

26 

The following tables present information about Occidental's average realized prices and index prices for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Oil and gas segment losses were $51 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared with segment losses of $3.1 billion for the third quarter of 2015. The pre-tax results for the third quarter of 2015 included $3.3 billion of pre-tax impairment and related charges, which reflected the sharp decline in the oil and gas futures price curves, as well as projects that management determined it would cease to pursue. After removing the impact of asset sales, impairments and other adjustments, the decrease in earnings year over year was mainly due to lower oil prices and volumes.  
    
  Total average daily production volumes were 605,000 BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 689,000 BOE for the third quarter of 2015. Occidental completed the sale of the Piceance Basin assets on March 1, 2016, and continues to reduce its exposure to non-core operations in the Middle East/North Africa. Occidental completed its exit from Bahrain in the third quarter of 2016. These non-core domestic and international operations produced average daily volumes of 111,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, total company average daily oil and gas production volumes for ongoing operations increased by 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 605,000 BOE from 578,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2015. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, domestic average daily production for ongoing operations decreased by 6,000 BOE to 294,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2016, with South Texas decreasing by 10,000 BOE, which was partially offset by a 5,000 BOE production increase by Permian Resources. International average daily production for ongoing operations increased to 311,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2016 from 278,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in international production is primarily attributable to Al Hosn, which was still ramping up production in the third quarter of 2015, in addition to Oman's Block 62 production which commenced in 2016.

Worldwide commodity prices for the third quarter of 2016 were lower than the third quarter of 2015. The average quarterly WTI and Brent prices decreased to $44.94 per barrel and $46.98 per barrel, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $46.43 per barrel and $51.17 per barrel, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015.     Worldwide realized crude oil prices declined by 13 percent to $41.49 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $47.78 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015. Worldwide realized NGL prices increased by 2 percent to $14.99 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $14.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015. Domestic realized natural gas prices increased by 3 percent in the third quarter of 2016 to $2.30 per MCF, compared to $2.24 per MCF in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Oil and gas segment losses were $653 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with segment losses of $3.0 billion for the same period of 2015. The pre-tax results for the first nine months of 2015 included $3.6 billion of pre-tax impairment and related charges. After removing the impact of impairments and related charges, the decrease in earnings for the first nine months of 2016 was mainly due to oil prices partially offset by lower operating costs.  
    
  Total average daily production volumes for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were 638,000 BOE and 665,000 BOE, respectively. For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, non-core operations produced average daily volumes of 37,000 BOE and 110,000 BOE, respectively. For the first nine months of 2016, total company average daily oil and gas production volumes for ongoing operations increased by 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 601,000 BOE from 555,000 BOE for the first nine months of 2015. Domestic average daily production for ongoing operations increased by 4,000 BOE for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015 with Permian Resources increasing by 17,000 BOE, which was partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL production in South Texas. International average daily production for ongoing operations increased to 300,000 BOE for the first nine months of 2016 from 258,000 BOE for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in international production mainly comes from Al Hosn, which was not fully operational in the first nine months of 2015, and Oman's Block 62 production which commenced in 2016. 
    
  Worldwide commodity prices for the first nine months of 2016 were lower than the same period of 2015. Worldwide realized crude oil prices declined by 27 percent to $36.70 per barrel for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $50.33 per barrel for the same period of 2015. Worldwide realized NGL prices decreased by 19 percent to $13.58 per barrel for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $16.73 per barrel for the same period of 2015. Domestic realized natural gas prices decreased by 24 percent for the first nine months of 2016 to $1.74 per MCF, compared to $2.28 per MCF for the same period of 2015. 
    
  In October 2016, Occidental acquired producing and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin.  This acquisition includes 35,000 net acres in Reeves and Pecos counties, Texas in the Southern Delaware Basin, in areas where Occidental currently operates or has working interests. Separately, Occidental also acquired working interests in several producing oil and gas CO   2    floods and related EOR infrastructure, increasing Occidental's ownership in several properties where it is currently the operator or an existing working interest partner. The total purchase price for these transactions is approximately $2.0 billion, which Occidental funded from existing cash on hand.  
    
  Occidental s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products. The weak price environment continues to significantly impact earnings as compared to the same period in 2015. Further declines in these commodity prices may result in additional impairments to reduce the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties, as well as reducing the amount of these commodities that can be produced economically and the quantity and present value of proved reserves.      
    
  The calculated average first-day-of-the-month West Texas Intermediate oil price and Henry Hub natural gas price were $41.52 per barrel and $2.42 per MMBtu, respectively, for the first ten months of 2016 as compared to $50.28 per barrel and $2.66 per MMBtu for the twelve months of 2015. Lower commodity prices in 2016 could result in a portion of proved reserves deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as proved.     

Chemical Segment 
    
  Chemical segment earnings for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $117 million   and $419 million, respectively, compared to $272 million and $547 million for the same periods of 2015. Excluding gains on sale of the chemical assets, the lower earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflected lower sales volumes, primarily chlor-alkali and calcium chloride, along with higher ethylene costs resulting from significant planned and unplanned industry cracker outages, which was partially offset  

28 

by higher realized caustic soda pricing. Excluding gains on sale for the chemical assets, the lower earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflected lower vinyl margins as vinyl prices declined more than key material costs. In addition, chlor-alkali sales prices and volumes were unfavorable across most product lines which was partially offset by lower energy costs. Calcium chloride earnings were negatively impacted by the mild winter weather conditions.  

Midstream and Marketing Segment 
    
  Midstream and marketing losses were   $180 million   and $333 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to segment earnings of $24 million and $96 million for the same periods of 2015. The three months ended September 30, 2016 included a crude oil supply contract termination charge of $160 million. Excluding the termination charge, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials and lower domestic pipeline income due to lower throughput volumes.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Occidental had $3.2 billion in cash. Subsequent to the quarter end, Occidental acquired Permian producing and non-producing leasehold acreage, CO   2    properties and related infrastructure for approximately $2.0 billion. Occidental funded these acquisitions from existing cash on hand.  Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's realized prices, sales volumes and operating costs.  In the first nine months of 2016, Occidental significantly reduced its capital expenditures compared to the prior year period.  With a continued focus on capital efficiency and operational efficiency, Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments and through future borrowings, and if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance.  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $  2.5 billion   and $2.4 billion for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The 2016 amount include $0.9 billion from discontinued operations related to the Ecuador settlement. Cash flows were negatively impacted by significantly lower oil prices and sales volumes in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; this was partially offset by operating cost reductions as well as cash receipts of $882 million for the Ecuador settlement and $302 million of federal income tax refunds. The impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is typically less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because these segments are significantly smaller. The usage of working capital of approximately $460 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly reflected higher oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2016 compared to the year-end of 2015, which increased marketing receivables.  
    
  Occidental s net cash used by investing activities was $2.0 billion for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $5.1 billion for the same period of 2015. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of   2016   were $1.8 billion of which $1.4 billion was for the oil and gas segment, compared to $4.2 billion for the first nine months of 2015 of which $3.6 billion was for the oil and gas segment. The change in capital accrual for both periods reflected amounts paid in the current year related to capital expenditures incurred and accrued in the fourth quarter of the preceding year.  Capital expenditures have been significantly reduced in response to the current commodity price environment. 
    
  Occidental s net cash used by financing activities was $0.5 billion for the first nine months of   2016  , compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  $1.5 billion for the same period of   2015  . Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion was used to pay dividends and repay debt in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, Occidental received net proceeds of $2.72 billion and $1.48 billion for the issuance of senior notes, respectively. In the first nine months of 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes due February 2016 and $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes due June 2016, and redeemed $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due February 2017. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Occidental was in compliance with all covenants of its financing agreements and had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.

Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures 
  Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.  Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.  Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand. 
  The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.  OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.  Remedial activities may include one or more of the following:  investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.   These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. 
  Refer to Note 6,   Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures,   in the   Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements   in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and to the   Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures   section of   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in the 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Occidental s environmental expenditures. 
   
  Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.  Reserve balances for other matters as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets. Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above. Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses which it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. For further information, see Note 7,   Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies,   in the   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements   in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in the information required to be provided under Item 305 of Regulation S-K included under Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Occidental's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  There has been no change in Occidental's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the first nine months of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Occidental's internal control over financial reporting.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE  
  OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION 
  2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  This First Amendment (the    First Amendment   ) to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ), is made effective as of July 14, 2016     (the        Amendment Effective Date   ).  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan. 
    
  WHEREAS  , Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), previously adopted the Plan;  
  WHEREAS  , Section 8 of the Plan provides, among other things, that, subject to certain exceptions, the Board may amend the Plan without the consent of the Company s stockholders and the Committee may amend an outstanding Award granted under the Plan without the consent of Participants under the Plan; and 
    WHEREAS  , (i) the Board desires to amend the Plan in order to enable the Company to withhold amounts of withholding and other taxes due with respect to an Award (including outstanding Awards) from shares of Stock (including shares of Stock otherwise issuable under an Award) at the maximum statutory withholding rate applicable to a Participant and (ii) the Committee desires to establish certain withholding procedures with respect to outstanding Awards granted on or before the Amendment Effective Date, in each case, pursuant to the First Amendment. 
    
    NOW, THEREFORE  ,   BE IT RESOLVED  , that, the Plan shall be amended as of the Amendment Effective Date, as set forth below:  
    
  1.    Section 9(b) of the Plan shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:  
    
   (b)   Tax Withholding  .  The Company and any of its Subsidiaries are authorized to withhold from any Award granted, or any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company, its Subsidiaries and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award. The Committee shall determine the form of payment of such tax withholding obligations, including without limitation cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned shares or through a cashless or net settlement or a broker-assisted sale or other reduction of the amount of shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate. This shall include authority to, in the discretion of the Committee with respect to any Participant who is subject to Rule 16b-3 (which Committee, for these purposes, shall be comprised of two or more  nonemployee directors  within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) or the full Board and which such discretion may not be delegated to management), withhold, sell or receive Stock or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participant s tax obligations, either on a mandatory or elective basis; provided, that if such tax obligations are satisfied through the withholding of shares of Stock that are otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to an Award (or through the surrender of shares of Stock by the Participant to the Company), the number of shares of Stock that  

may be so withheld (or surrendered) shall not exceed the number of shares of Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of withholding (or surrender) equal to the aggregate amount of such obligations determined based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in the applicable Participant s jurisdiction that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment with respect to such Award, as determined by the Committee. 
    
  2.    The Award Agreement for each outstanding Award that was granted on or before  the Amendment Effective Date     is hereby deemed to be amended to reflect Section 9(b) of the Plan, as amended by the First Amendment, and that, unless (a) specifically provided otherwise in the future by an action of the Committee (which action may not be delegated to the Company s management), or (b) a Participant provides official notification to the Company to apply a different applicable withholding rate, the Company shall withhold all applicable tax-related items legally payable by the Participant upon the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the outstanding Award from any cash and shares of Stock that are to be paid or issued to the Participant pursuant to the Award, in any combination as determined by the Committee in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement based on the Participant s applicable minimum statutory withholding rate at the time such tax obligations are due.   
    
  FURTHER RESOLVED  , that except as amended hereby, the Plan and each outstanding Award Agreement shall continue to read in their current states and are specifically ratified and reaffirmed.

  Supplemental Retirement Plan II 

Effective as of January 1, 2005 
  Amended and Restated as of November 1, 2008 
  Restated as of October 31, 2016 solely to incorporate all interim amendments

Article 1. Introduction 
  1.1         Adoption of the Plan 
  The Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II (the  Plan ) was originally adopted by Occidental Petroleum Corporation (the  Company ) effective as of January 1, 2005.  Effective November 1, 2008, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the  Supplemental Retirement Plan ) was merged with and into this Plan, which was amended and restated (the  2008 Restatement ) as set forth herein.  Effective November 1, 2008, the account of each participant under the Supplemental Retirement Plan was transferred to this Plan and governed by the terms of this Plan.  Effective as of October 31, 2016, the Company restated this Plan in its entirety solely for the purpose of incorporating all interim amendments made to the Plan since the 2008 Restatement. 
    
  1.2        Purpose of the Plan 
  
   3 

It is the purpose of this Plan to provide eligible employees with benefits that will compensate them for maximums imposed by law upon contributions to qualified plans.  The portion of the Plan reflecting credits to compensate for the maximum limits imposed by Code section 415 is intended to constitute an  excess plan  as defined in ERISA section 3(36).  The remaining portion of the Plan is intended to constitute a plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees and is intended to meet the exemptions provided in ERISA sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1), as well as the requirements of Department of Labor Regulation section 2520.104-23.  The Plan shall be administered and interpreted so as to meet the requirements of these exemptions and the regulation. 
  1.3         Status of the Plan 
           (a) 
    Nonqualified Plan.   The Plan is not qualified within the meaning of Code section 401(a). The Plan is intended to provide an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future and thus not to involve, pursuant to Treas. Reg.   1.83-3(e), the transfer of  property  for purposes of Code section 83. Likewise, allocations under this Plan to the account maintained for a Participant, and earnings credited thereon, are not intended to confer an economic benefit upon the Participant nor is the right to the receipt of future benefits under the Plan intended to result in any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee being in constructive receipt of any amount so as to result in any benefit due under the Plan being includible in the gross income of any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee in advance of the date on which payment of any benefit due under the Plan is actually made. 
              (b) 
    Compliance with Code Section 409A.   This Plan generally is intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A and related regulatory guidance, so that the taxation of Participants and Beneficiaries on any compensation deferred under this Plan is deferred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts that are credited and paid annually from a Participant s account following the Participant s attainment of a specified age, as described in Sections 5.1(b)(1) and 5.8(b)(1), are intended to qualify as short-term deferrals under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision) and accordingly to be exempt from such requirements.  
              (c) 
    No Guarantees of Intended Tax Treatment.   The Plan shall be administered and interpreted so as to satisfy the requirements for the intended tax treatment under the Code described in this section. However, the treatment of benefits earned under and benefits received from this Plan, for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws (such as state income and employment tax laws), shall be determined under the Code and other applicable tax laws and no guarantee or commitment is made to any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee with respect to the treatment of accruals under or benefits payable from the Plan for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws. 
     1.4         Application of the Plan

           (B) 
    Whose annualized Base Pay of Record exceeds the Threshold Amount applicable to the Employee for the Plan Year. 
       
  If the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record increases during the Plan Year such that it exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Employee shall be eligible for the allocation specified in subsection (b) as of the first payroll period for which the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record exceeds the  
  
   14 

Threshold Amount (or, if later, as of the date the Employee s participation in the Plan commences pursuant to Section 3.1). If the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record decreases during the Plan Year such that it no longer exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Employee shall cease to be eligible for the allocation specified in subsection (b) as of the first payroll period for which the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record falls below the Threshold Amount. 
    
  (2)        An Employee: 
    
           (A) 
    Who is eligible to participate in the Savings Plan and the Retirement Plan for the Plan Year, and 
       
           (B)

  Whether an Employee meets the requirements of this paragraph (2) shall be determined as of May 1   st    of each Plan Year by the Company.  An Employee who meets such requirements shall be eligible for the allocation specified in subsection (b) beginning as of May 1   st    of the Plan Year (or with respect to a newly eligible Employee, once the Employee s participation in the Plan has commenced pursuant to Section 3.1).  Until such determination is made during the Plan Year (and, with respect to a newly eligible Employee, the Employee s participation in the Plan has commenced pursuant to Section 3.1), an Employee shall not be treated as actively participating in this Plan with respect to a Plan Year by reason of this paragraph (2) and, unless otherwise eligible under paragraph (1), shall not be entitled to the allocations specified in subsection (b) for the Plan Year. 
    
  (3)        An individual who is an LTD Participant for the Plan Year.

For avoidance of doubt, references below to the  Annual Bonus paid  refer only to the portion of an Employee s Annual Bonus that is actually paid to the Employee and not deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
       
  The amount of the credit shall equal the sum of:  

15 

(i) 
    7 percent of Base Pay of Record and Annual Bonus paid for the calendar month below the Wage Base; plus 
       
           (ii) 
    12 percent of Base Pay of Record and Annual Bonus paid for the calendar month above the Wage Base. 
       
           (2) 
    Reduction Amount.   The amounts contingently credited to the account maintained for the Participant during the Plan Year under paragraph (1) shall be reduced as of the last day of the Plan Year, but not below zero, by the amount determined under this paragraph. The reduction amount is intended to be equal to the Employee s allocation under the Retirement Plan for the Plan Year assuming that the Employee maximized deferrals under the Savings Plan.

           (A) 
    No reduction shall apply to the account maintained for any Participant, including an LTD Participant, who is not an Employee on the last day of the Plan Year. 
       
           (B) 
    The reduction amount for other Participants shall be equal to the dollar limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 415(c)(1)(A) minus any Retirement Plan allocations to date, minus the sum of the following: 

(I) 
    the Contribution Percentage Limit for the Plan Year, determined under Appendix E of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision) times the Participant s Base Pay Paid and 6 percent of the Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year, and

    6 percent times the sum of the Participant s Base Pay Paid and Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year; 

(I) 
    The Plan Limit for the Plan Year, determined under Appendix II of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision), times the Participant s Base Pay Paid, and 
       
           (II) 
    6 percent times the Participant s Base Pay Paid for the Plan Year. 
       
  For purposes of determining the reduction under this subparagraph, no portion of the sum of the Participant s Base Pay Paid and Annual  
  
   16 

Bonus Paid for the Plan Year in excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) in effect for the Plan Year shall be taken into account. The reduction amount shall not be less than zero. 
    
           (3)

           (a) 
    Eligibility for Allocations Relating to Limits Under Code section 401(a)(17).    An Employee who is eligible to participate in the Savings Plan for the Plan Year and whose Base Pay Paid plus Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year exceeds the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) as adjusted and in effect for the Plan Year shall be provided the allocation for the Plan Year specified in subsection (b). 
       
           (b) 
    Allocation Amount.   The amount to be allocated as of the last day of the Plan Year under this Plan with respect to a Participant described in subsection (a) above for the Plan Year shall equal the sum of: 
              (1) 
    7 percent of the Employee s Base Pay Paid plus Annual Bonus Paid in excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) as adjusted and in effect for the Plan Year; and 
              (2) 
    5 percent of the amount allocated under paragraph (1) which shall be allocated to the account maintained for the Participant in lieu of interest on such amount for the Plan Year. 
     4.3         Allocations Relating to the Deferred Compensation Plan 
           (a) 
    Retirement Plan 
       
           (1) 
    Eligibility.   The following Employees who become Participants shall be provided the allocation for the Plan Year specified in subsection (2):  An Employee:

              (B) 
    Who makes a deferral election under the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Plan Year.

However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an Employee of Phibro LLC and its affiliates is not eligible to receive an allocation for the Plan Year specified in paragraph (2).

    Allocation Amount.    The amount to be allocated in a Plan Year with respect to a Participant described in paragraph (1) shall equal the Participant s applicable percentage multiplied by the amount of Annual Bonus the Participant has deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no allocation shall be made to the account of a Participant who is not an Employee on the date such bonus is awarded. 
     For purposes of this subsection, the term  applicable percentage  shall mean 12 percent. The allocation described in this section shall be made to the account of each Participant effective as of the date on which the Participant is awarded his Annual Bonus. 
    
  (b)        Savings Plan 
           (1) 
    An Employee who is eligible to participate in the Savings Plan and makes a deferral election under the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Plan Year shall be provided the allocation for the Plan Year specified in paragraph (2).  However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an Employee of New Eastport Services, LLC and its affiliates is not eligible to receive an allocation for the Plan Year specified in paragraph (2). 
              (2) 
    The amount to be allocated for a Plan Year with respect to a Participant described in paragraph (1) shall equal the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company or other Employer on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant s Base Pay of Record for such Plan Year and/or the Participant s Annual Bonus Paid in such Plan Year because of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan, assuming that the Participant s contribution percentage under the Savings Plan for the Plan Year is 7 percent.  The allocation described in this Sections 4.3(a)(2) or 4.3(b)(2) shall be made to the account of a Participant at the same time as the employer contribution for such Plan Year is made to the Savings Plan.  No allocations shall be made to Participants  accounts under this Section 4.3(b)(2) prior to January 1, 2009.  
     4.4         Maintenance of Accounts 
           (a) 
    Each Employer shall establish and maintain, in the name of each Participant employed by that Employer, an individual account which shall consist of all amounts  
     
   18 

credited to the Participant. As of the end of each month, the Administrative Committee shall increase the balance, if any, of the Participant s individual account as of the last day of the preceding month, by multiplying such amount by a number equal to one plus .167% plus the monthly yield on 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturities for the monthly processing period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any allocation made to a Participant's account pursuant to Section 4.3(a)(2) or 4.3(b)(2) shall be credited with interest, at a rate equivalent to that set forth in the preceding sentence, from the date such allocation is made to the Participant's account. 
    
           (b) 
    The individual account of each Participant shall represent a liability, payable when due under this Plan, out of the general assets of the Company, or from the assets of any trust, custodial account or escrow arrangement which the Company may establish for the purpose of assuring availability of funds sufficient to pay benefits under this Plan, provided that  no assets shall be transferred to a trust or other account if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code section 409A(b). The money and any other assets in any such trust or account shall at all times remain the property of the Company, and neither this Plan nor any Participant shall have any beneficial ownership interest in the assets thereof. No property or assets of the Company shall be pledged, encumbered, or otherwise subjected to a lien or security interest for payment of benefits hereunder. Accounting for this Plan shall be based on generally accepted accounting principles. 
     4.5         Vesting and Forfeiture 
  Notwithstanding any other Plan provision, all benefits under this Plan shall be contingent and forfeitable and no Participant shall have a vested interest in any benefit unless, while he is still employed by an Employer, he becomes fully vested in his benefit under the Retirement Plan (or would have become vested if he were a participant in the Retirement Plan).  A person who terminates employment with an Employer for any reason prior to becoming vested hereunder shall not receive a benefit, provided that, upon rehire by an Employer, any amounts forfeited by a Participant at the time of his termination of employment shall be restored, without interest, to his account and, as set forth in Section 5.8, shall be subject to the same terms and conditions relating to distribution as were applicable at the time of his prior termination of employment.

    Payment Events.    A Participant s vested account under this Plan shall be paid on the earliest to occur of the following payment events:  
              (1) 
    The Participant s attainment of a specified age elected by the Participant that is age 60 or above; 
     
   19 

(2) 
    The Participant s Separation from Service; or 
              (3) 
    The Participant s death. 
       
  (b)        Timing and Form. 
    
           (1) 
    Attainment of Specified Age.    If payment is made on account of a Participant s attainment of a specified age (60 or above), payment shall be made to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant reaches the specified age.  In addition, within the first 70 days of each subsequent calendar year, the Participant shall be paid any additional amounts credited to the Participant s account since the prior payment date.   
       
           (2)

           (A) 
    If payment is made on account of the Participant s Separation from Service, payment shall be made or commence within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant s Separation from Service occurs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Participant who is a Specified Employee, payment shall be made or commence in the month next following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, if later than the time provided above.   
       
           (B)

If the Participant elects to have payment made in annual installments, the installments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year during the installment period (except that the first installment may be delayed in the case of a Specified Employee as provided above).  During the installment period, the Participant s account shall continue to be adjusted as provided in Section 4.4(a) until the installments have been completed.  The amount of each annual installment shall equal the amount credited to the Participant s account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of payment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the number of installments (including the current installment) which remain to be paid.  
       
           (C) 
    If a Participant who is receiving installment payments on account of his Separation from Service has also made a specified age election and attains the specified age before the completion of all installments, the remaining installments shall be paid to him at the scheduled time or times without regard to his attainment of such age.  

20 

(3) 
    Death.    If payment is made on account of the Participant s death, payment shall be made to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum 120 days following the date of the Participant s death.

If the Employee does not make a transition election with respect to form of payment upon Separation from Service and had previously made an election to have payment upon Separation from Service made in a lump sum or in annual installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, payment on account of the Participant s Separation from Service shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5.1(b)(2) in the form previously elected by the Participant.  For this purpose, if the Participant had different payment elections in effect for his account under this Plan and his account under the Supplemental Retirement Plan prior to November 1, 2008, or had an election in effect under one plan but not the other, the accounts shall continue to be maintained separately and these provisions shall be applied separately to each account.   
              (3)

           (b) 
    Changes in Time or Form of Payment.    A Participant may elect to change the time or form of payment of his account in accordance with the rules set forth below.

              (C) 
    The election must be made at least 12 months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which payment (or payment of the initial installment, if applicable) is otherwise scheduled to be made.       
              (3) 
    A Participant may make only two changes pursuant to this Section 5.2(b).  Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of Section 5.2(b)(2).  No further changes may be made following a Participant s Separation from Service.    
       
           (c)

24 

(a)

           (b) 
    New account.    If a terminated Participant is reemployed by an Employer and resumes active participation in the Plan pursuant to Section 3.2, a new account shall be established for such Participant to which allocations relating to the period following the Participant s reemployment (and any unvested amounts forfeited from the Participant s account at the time of his first termination) shall be credited.  Such new account, to the extent vested, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the Participant s most recent payment election, if any, prior to his first termination.  For this purpose, the following rules shall apply: 
       
           (1) 
    If the Participant had previously elected (including pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(1)) to have payment made at a specified age (60 or above) prior to Separation from Service or death and has reached such specified age at the time of his reemployment, the Participant shall be paid, within the first 70 days of each calendar year following the calendar year containing his reemployment date, the amount credited to his account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of payment.  
       
           (2) 
    Any election made as a terminated Participant pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(2) or (3) shall not be taken into account for purposes of this provision.

Payment shall be made in the form (i.e., lump sum or installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years) elected by the Participant under this Section 5.9(b)(1) or, if the Participant does not make a transition election, the form previously elected by the Participant under Appendix A of the Supplemental Retirement Plan, or, if none, in a lump sum.

           (1) 
    The Administrative Committee and each of its members, which, for purposes of this section, includes any Employee to whom the Administrative Committee has delegated fiduciary or other duties. 
       
           (2) 
    The Board and each member of the Board and any Employer who has responsibility (whether by delegation from another person, an allocation of  
     
   31 

responsibilities under the terms of this Plan document, or otherwise) for a fiduciary duty, a nonfiduciary settlor function (such as deciding whether to approve a plan amendment), or a nonfiduciary administrative task relating to the Plan. 
    
           (b) 
    The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees and court costs, incurred by that person on account of his or her good faith actions or failures to act with respect to his or her responsibilities relating to the Plan. The Company s indemnification shall include payment of any amounts due under a settlement of any lawsuit or investigation, but only if the Company agrees to the settlement. 
       
           (1) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section only if he or she notifies an Appropriate Person at the Company of any claim asserted against or any investigation of the Indemnified Person that relates to the Indemnified Person s responsibilities with respect to the Plan. 
       
           (A) 
    A person is an    Appropriate Person    to receive notice of the claim or investigation if a reasonable person would believe that the person notified would initiate action to protect the interests of the Company in response to the Indemnified Person s notice. 
       
           (B) 
    The notice may be provided orally or in writing. The notice must be provided to the Appropriate Person promptly after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the claim or investigation.  No indemnification shall be provided under this section to the extent that the Company is materially prejudiced by the unreasonable delay of the Indemnified Person in notifying an Appropriate Person of the claim or investigation. 

(2) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to attorney s fees, court costs or other litigation expenses or any settlement of such litigation only if the Indemnified Person agrees to permit the Company to select counsel and to conduct the defense of the lawsuit. 
       
           (3) 
    No Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to any action or failure to act that is judicially determined to constitute or be attributable to the willful misconduct of the Indemnified Person. 
       
           (4) 
    Payments of any indemnity under this section shall be made only from insurance or other assets of the Company. The provisions of this section shall not preclude such further indemnities as may be available under insurance purchased by the Company or as may be provided by the Company under any by-law, agreement or otherwise, provided that no expense shall be  
     
   32 

indemnified under this section that is otherwise indemnified by the Company or by an insurance contract purchased by the Company. 
    
           (5) 
    Payment of any indemnity under this section that is not exempt from Code section 409A shall comply with Code section 409A s requirements for reimbursement plans, as set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) (or any successor provision).  For this purpose, (i) the indemnity under this section shall continue for the Indemnified Person s lifetime, and, if later, until the complete disposition of all covered claims, (ii) the amount of expenses indemnified during one taxable year of an Indemnified Person shall not affect the amount of expenses indemnified in any other taxable year; (iii) payment of an indemnity shall be made by the last day of the Indemnified Person s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred and (iv) the Indemnified Person s right to indemnification shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.  If, after payment of any amount to the Indemnified Person pursuant to this provision, it is determined, pursuant to paragraph (3) above or otherwise, that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Indemnified Person shall promptly repay such amount to the Company. 
       
  Article 7. Amendment and Termination 
  7.1         Amendment and Termination 
  The Company expects the Plan to be permanent, but since future conditions affecting the Company or any Employer cannot be anticipated or foreseen, the Company must necessarily and does hereby reserve the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board, except that no amendment shall reduce the dollar amount permanently credited to a Participant s account and any such termination or amendment shall apply uniformly to all Participants.  The Administrative Committee, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if it finds that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease benefits or costs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Administrative Committee may amend the Plan to: 
    
           (a) 
    Ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Code section 409A for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution; and 
       
           (b) 
    Add provisions for changes to elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Code section 409A for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution. 
       
           7.2 
    Payments Upon Termination 
     
   33 

If the Plan is terminated, distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries shall be made on the dates on which such distributions would be made under the Plan without regard to such termination, except that payments may, in the discretion of the Board, be accelerated if: 
    
           (a) 
    Accelerated payment is permitted under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (or any successor provision); or 
       
           (b) 
    The Plan is terminated because Participants have become subject to tax on their deferrals due to the Plan s failure to satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A.  Payment to a Participant may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure.  
     7.3         Reorganization of Employer 
  In the event of a merger or consolidation of an Employer, or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of an Employer to another corporation, such continuing, resulting or transferee corporation shall have the right to continue and carry on the Plan and to assume all liabilities of the Employer hereunder without obtaining the consent of any Participant or Beneficiary.  If such successor shall assume the liabilities of the Employer hereunder, then the Employer shall be relieved of all such liability, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to assert any claim against the Employer for benefits under or in connection with the Plan. 
  Article 8. Claims and Appeals Procedures 
  8.1         Application for Benefits

           (d) 
    Within 60 days after receipt by the Claimant of notification of the adverse benefit determination, the Claimant or his duly authorized representative, upon written application to the Administrative Committee, may request that the Administrative Committee fully and fairly review the adverse benefit determination.  On review of an adverse benefit determination, upon request and free of charge, the Claimant shall have reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits.  The Claimant shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits.  The Administrative Committee s (or delegate s) review shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted regardless of whether the information was previously considered in the initial adverse benefit determination. 
       
           (e) 
    Within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 60 days after receipt of such request for review, the Administrative Committee or its delegate shall notify the Claimant of any final benefit determination on the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.

  Article 9. General Provisions 
  9.1         Unsecured General Creditor 
  The rights of a Participant, Beneficiary, Alternate Payee or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company or Employer promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company or any Employer, nor shall any assets of the Company or any Employer be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises. 
  
   36 

9.2         Trust Fund 
  The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan.  At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Administrative Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits.  Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company s creditors.  To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.  No assets shall be transferred to a trust if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code section 409A(b).  
    
  9.3         Nonassignability 
    
           (a) 
    Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amount, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable.  No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
       
           (b) 
    Notwithstanding subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized. The Administrative Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Administrative Committee constitutes a qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders.  In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order. 
       
  9.4         Release from Liability to Participant 
  A Participant s right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of the account maintained for the Participant has been paid or set aside for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order.  The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which: (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts; and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order. 
  
   37 

9.5         Employment Not Guaranteed 
  Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to be retained in employment with the Company or any Employer.  Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement to the contrary, the Company and Employer shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. 
  9.6         Gender, Singular   Plural 
  All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine or feminine as the identity of the person or persons may require.  As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular. 
  9.7         Captions 
  The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions. 
  9.8         Validity 
  In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan. 
  9.9         Notice 
  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrative Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company.  Such notice shall be deemed given as to the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
  9.10         Applicable Law 
  The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Code section 409A (or any successor provision), and any regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable, and in accordance with the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.

OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION   MODIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 
  Effective December 31, 2006   Amended and Restated Effective November 1, 2008 
  Restated as of October 31, 2016 solely to incorporate all interim amendments 
    
  ARTICLE I  PURPOSE 
  Effective December 31, 2006, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 2 (the  DCP2 ) was merged with and into the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the  2005 DCP ), which was amended and restated as the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Modified Deferred Compensation Plan (the  Plan ). Effective December 31, 2006, for each Participant making a Special Transition Rule Election under Section 5.12, the Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was merged with the Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the 2005 DCP, the Savings Plan Restoration Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was merged with the Savings Plan Restoration Account (if any) of such Participant under the 2005 DCP, the SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was transferred to the 2005 DCP, and all such accounts are governed by the terms of this Plan. For Participants not making such an election, any Deferral Account, Savings Plan Restoration Account, or SEDCP Deferral Account of such Participant under the DCP2 or 2005 DCP is subject to the terms of this Plan but maintained separate from each other. Effective November 1, 2008, the Plan was amended and restated (the  2008 Restatement ) as set forth herein. Effective as of October 31, 2016, Occidental Petroleum Corporation restated the Plan in its entirety solely for the purpose of incorporating all interim amendments made to the Plan since the 2008 Restatement. 
  The purpose of the Plan is to provide a tax-deferred opportunity for key management and highly compensated employees of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its Affiliates (as defined below) to accumulate additional retirement income through deferrals of compensation. 
  This Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, so that the taxation to Participants or Beneficiaries of any compensation deferred under this Plan is deferred.

All decisions of the Committee shall be by vote of at least two of the Committee members and shall be final. The Committee may appoint any agent and delegate to such agent such powers and duties in connection with the administration of the Plan as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted and administered accordingly. 
  Members of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan while serving as members of the Committee, but a member of the Committee shall not vote or act upon any matter which relates solely to such member s interest in the Plan as a Participant. 
    
  ARTICLE IV      PARTICIPATION 
  4.1      Election to Participate. 
  (a)      Deferral Elections.   An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan and elect to defer annual Base Salary and/or Bonus under the Plan by filing with the Committee a completed and fully executed Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of the Plan Year during which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which such Base Salary and Bonus are to be earned, or at such other time as the Committee may permit in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A. Deferral Election Forms must be filed in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Forms. 
  
   8 

An employee who first becomes an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year may make an initial deferral election under this Plan within 30 days after the date the employee becomes an Eligible Employee provided that such Eligible Employee has not previously become eligible to participate in any other account balance plan that is required to be aggregated with this Plan as described in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(c)(2) (or any successor provision). Any such election shall apply to Base Salary earned for services performed after the 30-day election window described in the previous sentence and to that portion of the Bonus earned during such Plan Year equal to the total amount of the Bonus multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the Plan Year after the 30-day election window described in the previous sentence ends over the total number of days in the Plan Year. 
  A Deferral Election Form filed for a Plan Year shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year only. For each subsequent Plan Year, an Eligible Employee who wishes to defer Base Salary and/or Bonus must file a new complete and fully executed Deferral Election Form in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Form but in any event prior to January 1 of such Plan Year. 
  Each Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant. Deferrals of Base Salary will normally be deducted ratably during the Plan Year, except as otherwise determined by the Committee to take into account special circumstances; provided that in no event will the Committee s action alter the total amount of Deferrals for the Plan Year. In its sole discretion, the Committee may also permit amounts that an Eligible Employee has previously elected to defer under other plans or agreements with the Company to be transferred to this Plan and credited to his Deferral Accounts that are maintained hereunder, provided that no change shall be made in the time or form of payment of such transferred amounts except as may be permitted by Code Section 409A. 
  (A)  Minimum Deferral.   For each Plan Year, the minimum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is $5,000, if expressed as a dollar amount, or 5% of Base Salary, if expressed as a percentage, and the minimum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is any of the following: (I) $5,000, (II) 5% of Bonus, or (III) 100% of that portion of any Bonus that exceeds a dollar amount specified by the Participant on his Deferral Election Form. 
  (B)  Maximum Deferral.   For each Plan Year, the maximum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is 75% of Base Salary, and the maximum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is 90% of Bonus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective with respect to amounts earned on or after January 1, 2007, for each Plan Year, the maximum total amount of Compensation that a Participant may elect to defer is $75,000. For the 2007 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply only to deferrals of Base Salary that would otherwise have been paid in 2007. For the 2008 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply to the deferrals of Base Salary that     would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2007, and otherwise paid in 2008. For the 2008 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall also apply to deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2008, and otherwise paid in 2009. For the 2009  
  
   9 

and all future Plan Years, the $75,000 limit shall apply to amounts of Base Salary and Bonus earned in any one Plan Year. For example, in Plan Year 2009, the $75,000 limit shall first apply to deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2009 and then to deferrals of Bonus that are earned in 2009 and would otherwise be payable in 2010. 
  (C)      Deferral Account Balance.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s total Deferral Account balance is $1,000,000 or more, then the Participant may not defer any compensation earned in the following Plan Year and any election to do so shall be considered void. If as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s total Deferral Account balance is less than $1,000,000, then the Participant may defer compensation earned in the following Plan Year in accordance with this Article IV. 
  (b)  Early Payment Benefit Election.   With respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus earned after December 31, 2007, on the Deferral Election Form filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a), an Eligible Employee may irrevocably elect to receive all or a portion of the Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to that election in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over two (2) to five (5) years commencing prior to Separation from Service in an Early Payment Year. If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum. The Early Payment Year elected must be a year that begins at least two (2) years after the end of each Plan Year to which the election applies. An Early Payment Benefit election filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2008, or for any subsequent Plan Year, shall be effective for the deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus earned during that Plan Year. A Participant may make an election for an Early Payment Benefit with respect to deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus earned in any future Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year. A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of an Early Payment Benefit with respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a). 
  A Participant may not at any time have Early Payment Benefits scheduled for more than two Early Payment Years. However, after an Early Payment Year has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Year election have been completed, a Participant may elect a new Early Payment Year for future deferrals of Base Salary and/or Bonuses. 
  (c)  Deferral of Performance Award Cash Payments.   Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the cash portion (if any) subject to a deferral election under a Qualifying Performance Stock Award that was granted before December 31, 2006 but becomes vested on or after December 31, 2006 shall be credited to the Eligible Employee s DCP Deferral Account as a Performance Award Cash Deferral unless the Participant elected, pursuant to transition rules under Code Section 409A, to receive distribution of the cash portion of the Qualifying Performance Stock Award in 2008. Any cash portion of a Qualifying Performance     Stock Award that becomes vested on or after December 31, 2006 and payable in 2008 pursuant to an election as described herein, shall be credited to a special subaccount of the Participant s DCP Deferral Account and distributed in a lump sum during the first seventy-five (75) days of 2008. No additional amounts shall be credited to a Participant s DCP Deferral Account pursuant to this provision after December 31, 2007. 
  
   10 

4.2      DCP Deferral Accounts.   The Committee shall establish and maintain a separate DCP Deferral Account for each Participant. A DCP Deferral Amount shall be credited by the Company to the Participant s DCP Deferral Account, subject to the Committee s authority in Section 4.1(a), as of the date that the Participant s Base Salary and/or Bonus would otherwise have been paid. The amount of a Participant s Performance Award Cash Deferral shall be credited to a Participant s DCP Deferral Account as of the date it becomes certified for payment. Such DCP Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. The Committee shall establish an Early Payment Year Subaccount within a Participant s DCP Deferral Account for each Early Payment Year elected by that Participant. Any such Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be debited by the amount of any Early Payment Benefit paid by the Company to the Participant in such Early Payment Year pursuant to Section 5.4 as of the date of payment. 
  4.3      SEDCP Deferral Accounts.   The Committee shall maintain a separate SEDCP Deferral Account for each Participant who was a participant in the SEDCP on December 31, 1998. The balance of such Participant s accounts under the SEDCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to each such Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, a predecessor to this Plan, as of January 1, 1999. SEDCP Deferral Accounts shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. 
  4.4      Interest.   Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the Declared Rate, compounded monthly. Except as provided in Section 5.2(a), with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account. Amounts of deferred Compensation that are credited to a DCP Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed from date of crediting to the end of the month. 
  4.5      Valuation of Deferral Accounts.   The value of a Deferral Account as of any date shall equal the amounts previously credited to such Deferral Account less any payments debited to such Deferral Account plus the interest deemed to be earned on such Deferral Account in accordance with Section 4.4 through the end of the preceding month. When payments are made from a DCP Deferral Account for any reason other than an Early Payment Benefit elected after January 1, 1994, such payments shall be deemed to be made on a proportionate or pro-rata basis from DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred under the 1988 DCP prior to January 1, 1994, and DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred after that date. 
  
   11 

4.6      Savings Plan Restoration Contribution. 
  (a)  General Rule.   For each Plan Year, the Company shall credit to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of any Participant, an amount equal to the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant s Base Salary for such Plan Year and/or the Participant s Annual Bonus (as defined in the Savings Plan) paid in such Plan Year because of deferrals under this Plan. The Savings Plan Restoration Contribution shall be credited to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of each Participant for each Plan Year at the same time as the Company contribution for such Plan Year is made to the Savings Plan. No further Savings Plan Restoration Contributions shall be credited to Participants  Savings Plan Restoration Accounts pursuant to this provision on or after December 31, 2008. 
  (b)  Vesting.   A Participant s interest in any credit to his Savings Plan Restoration Account and earnings thereon shall vest at the same rate and at the same time as would have been the case had such contribution been made to the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, upon a Participant s Separation from Service, the Participant has not or does not become 100% vested in his Savings Plan Restoration Account, the unvested portion of his Savings Plan Restoration Account shall be forfeited prior to the determination of the amount of any benefits under Sections 5.1, 5.5, or 5.6. 
  (c)  Transfer of Non-Vested Savings Plan Restoration Account from Prior Plan.   Effective as of January 1, 2005, that portion of a Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account under the Prior Plan that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, was transferred to and credited to such Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account under the 2005 DCP and is governed by the terms of this Plan, including any Distribution Election Form filed under the 2005 DCP on or before December 31, 2005. If the Participant was not participating in the 2005 DCP in 2005, the Participant could nevertheless make an election in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and 5.2 of the 2005 DCP if such election was made by December 31, 2005. If the Participant did not file a Distribution Election Form on or before December 31, 2005, with respect to such amount, together with interest the Participant was deemed to have made an election to receive distribution in accordance with Section 5.1(a). 
  4.7      Statement of Deferral Accounts.   The Committee shall submit to each Participant, within 120 days after the close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable, setting forth the Participant s Deferral Account(s). 
    
  4.8      2004 Bonuses. 
  (a)      Deferral under the 2005 DCP.   Any Bonus that was payable in 2005 to an employee of the Company for services performed during 2004 (a  2004 Bonus ) and that such individual elected to defer in accordance with the terms of the Prior Plan was deferred under the 2005 DCP instead of the Prior Plan. Any such 2004 Bonus was credited to the individual s DCP Deferral Account as set forth in Section 4.2 and is subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, including, without limitation, any distribution election made under Article V; provided, however, that if such individual did not file a Distribution Election Form under the 2005 DCP as provided in Section 5.1(b) at the time such 2004 Bonus was credited to his DCP Deferral Account, he could file a Distribution Election Form at any time prior to February 11, 2005, which then  
  
   12 

became applicable with respect to his 2004 Bonus and any other Compensation deferred and credited to the Participant s DCP Deferral Account under this Plan. 
  (b)      Opportunity to Revoke Deferral Election  . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any participant in the Prior Plan who elected to defer his 2004 Bonus could revoke his deferral election as provided in this Section 4.8(b). Such election had to be in writing on a form provided by the Committee and had to be filed with the Committee on or before January 21, 2005. Any participant in the Prior Plan who revoked his 2004 Bonus deferral election as provided herein received his 2004 Bonus in cash at or about the same time that 2004 Bonuses were paid to other employees of the Company. 
  4.9      Pre-Merger Payment Elections.   Any payment elections made or deemed to be made by a Participant under the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP and in effect immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006 shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless and until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The Committee shall establish and maintain separate subaccounts for each Deferral Account as may be necessary to account for amounts subject to different payout elections. 
    
  ARTICLE V      BENEFITS 
    
  5.1      Separation from Service for a Reason other than Death. 
    
  (a)  Form and Time of Benefit.   Except as otherwise provided in this Sections 5.1 and 5.4, upon a Participant s Separation from Service for a reason other than death (including Retirement), the Company shall pay to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year of the Participant s Separation from Service an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment (after reduction for any forfeitures as set forth in Section 4.6). Any Retirement Benefit paid in annual installments pursuant to Section 5.1(b) shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year, beginning with the year following the Participant s Retirement and shall be determined based on the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the last day of the month preceding payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Participant who is a Specified Employee is entitled to a distribution from the Plan upon or by virtue of such Participant s Separation from Service for a reason other than death, the lump sum payment or the first annual installment payment, as the case may be, shall be paid in the month next following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, if later than the time provided above. Any additional installment payments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year. 
    
  (b)  Retirement.   (i) On a Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that a Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, a Participant (A) may elect to have the Retirement Benefit, which may consist solely of the Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account, but which will not include any amounts attributable to an Early Payment Year Subaccount if Separation from Service occurs after beginning of the relevant Early Payment Year, paid to him in a lump sum or annual payments for any other  
  
   13 

number of years between two (2) and 20 years, and (B) may elect to have the amount of each annual installment determined under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. If a Participant fails to elect either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method, such Participant shall be deemed to have elected the Fractional Method. 
  (ii)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an election to receive distribution in a series of annual installments shall be treated as a single payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
  (iii)  Subject to Section 5.1(b)(iv), a Participant may change his election as to the form of Retirement distribution under this Plan subject to the following conditions: (A) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee; (B) the election must defer the lump sum payment or the initial amount of an installment payment for a period of at least five (5) years from the date that the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, was otherwise payable; and (C) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made. 
  (iv)  A Participant may only make two changes pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(iii). Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of Section 5.1(b)(iii). No further changes may be made following a Participant s Separation from Service. 
  (c)  Separation Prior to Retirement.   If a Participant s Separation from Service is for any reason other than Retirement or death, then the Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit in a lump sum as provided in Section 5.1(a). 
  (d)  Effect of Pre-Retirement Separation from Service on Spousal Survivor Benefits.   Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant whose Separation from Service occurs prior to Retirement and receives a Termination Benefit under this Section 5.1. 
    
  5.2      Beneficiary Benefits. 
  (a)    If Participant s Separation from Service is due to death, the Company will pay to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum a Beneficiary Benefit that is an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts (other than his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)). If such Participant also has an SEDCP Deferral Account, the Company will also pay to the Participant s Beneficiary annual payments over the greater of (i) 10 years or (ii) until the Participant would have attained age 65 equal to 25% of the amount deferred under the SEDCP (excluding any interest on such deferrals), which payments shall be in full satisfaction of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant s Beneficiary shall instead be paid the amount credited to the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which his death occurred plus interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, from the end of such month and credited annually on each anniversary of the end of such month payable in equal installments  
  
   14 

(using the Amortization method) over the period described in the preceding sentence, if the Committee determines that the present value of such benefit is greater than the present value of the benefit described in the preceding sentence. In comparing the present value of these two alternative benefits, the Committee shall use in each case a discount factor of 8%. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant s Separation from Service is due to death after attaining age 55, payment to his Beneficiary (other than payment of his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)) shall be made in the same form as payment of the Participant s Retirement Benefit would have been made to the Participant if he were living. 
  (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect, on a Beneficiary Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that the Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, that, if his Separation from Service is due to death prior to attaining age 55, payment to his Beneficiary (other than payment of his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)) shall be made in any form and calculated in any other manner described in Section 5.1(b) (which may be different than the form of payment elected by the Participant for his Retirement Benefit). A Participant may change his election as to the form of payment to his Beneficiary subject to the following conditions: (1) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee and (2) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made. Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of this Section 5.2(c). 
  (d)  If a Participant dies after Separation from Service but before commencement or completion of his benefits under the Plan, payment to his Beneficiary shall be made in the same amount, at the same time and in the same form as payment would have been made to the Participant if he were living under this Plan. If installment payments to the Participant have already commenced, then the remaining installments (if any) shall be paid to his Beneficiary in the same amounts and at the same times as such remaining installments would have been paid to the Participant if he were living. 
  (e)  The payment or payments to a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant under Section 5.2(a), (b) or (c) (including payments with respect to the SEDCP Deferral Account) shall be made or commence during the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year in which the Participant s death occurred, with any subsequent installments paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year, and the amount of such payment shall be equal to, or determined based on, the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment. 
  (f)  In the event that the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies prior to the completion of payments under this Plan to that Beneficiary, then the remaining payments shall be paid to that Beneficiary s estate in the same amounts and at the same times as such payments would have been paid to the Beneficiary if he were living. 
  
   15 

(g)  Any election as to the form and manner of payment to a Beneficiary in effect under the terms of the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006, shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless or until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The Committee shall establish and maintain separate subaccounts for each Deferral Account as may be necessary to account for amounts subject to different beneficiary payout elections. 
  5.3      Spousal Survivor Benefits with Respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts.   If a Participant who has an SEDCP Deferral Account dies after becoming eligible for Retirement or after commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit and a spouse to whom he had been married to for at least one (1) year prior to his death survives beyond completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance, the Company shall pay such spouse a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 10% of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance valued as of the earlier of the date of the Participant s Retirement or death. Such lump sum spousal survivor benefit shall be paid 120 days following the later of the completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance or the Participant s death. No benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.3 if the Participant s spouse does not survive beyond completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no spousal survivor benefit shall be payable to the spouse of any Participant who received benefits pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (Termination Benefit) or Section 5.6 (Immediate Payment on Change in Control). 
  5.4      Early Payment.   Payment of the amounts credited to any Early Payment Year Subaccount of a Participant shall be paid or commence to be paid within the first 90 days of the year elected as the Early Payment Year in accordance with the Participant s election under Section 4.1(b), with any subsequent annual payments paid in the first 90 days of each applicable year. The amount of each annual installment will be determined under the Fractional Method unless the Participant otherwise irrevocably elects the Amortization Method at the time of making the Early Payment Benefit election. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason prior to the Early Payment Year elected by the Participant, the election made by the Participant to receive the Early Payment Benefit shall terminate and the amount credited to the Participant s Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be paid, together with the other amounts credited to the Participant s Deferral Account, as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be. If the Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason after the start of the Early Payment Year but before the commencement or completion of the Early Payment Benefit, the benefit or remaining benefit attributable to the relevant Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be paid to the Participant (or his Beneficiary) in accordance with the Participant s Early Payment Benefit election without regard to the Participant s Separation from Service (i.e., once the Early Payment Year is reached, the Participant s subsequent Separation from Service for any reason shall not affect the payment of the relevant Early Payment Year Subaccount). 
  
   16 

5.5      Emergency Benefit.   In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, an Emergency Benefit that does not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant s assets to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship and the additional compensation available to the Participant upon the termination of the Participant s current deferral elections under the Plan, as described in the following paragraph of this Section 5.5. No amount may be paid to the Participant under this Section 5.5 from any unvested portion of the Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account. 
  Whenever a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.5, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the distribution. The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next enrollment period under the Plan and will be precluded from electing to make new deferrals under the Plan for a minimum period of one (1) year (or such lesser period as the Committee may permit) following receipt of the distribution. Such new election shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.1(a). 
  5.6      Effect of Change in Control.   In the event of a Change in Control, the Board may, in its sole discretion, within the 30 days preceding such Change in Control, irrevocably take action to terminate and liquidate the Plan, provided that the requirements of Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) (or any successor provision) are satisfied. 
  5.7      Small Benefit.   Notwithstanding any election by a Participant to receive payment of any account maintained for the Participant under the Plan in an installment payment form, if the value of such account is less than $50,000 at the time payment in such form is scheduled to commence under Section 5.1 or 5.2 (after reduction for any forfeiture pursuant to Section 4.6), the account shall be paid to the Participant in a single lump sum on the scheduled commencement date. This provision shall not apply to (i) any Early Payment Year Subaccount that is being paid pursuant to an Early Payment Benefit election or (ii) the Beneficiary benefit with respect to a Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account described in Section 5.2(a). 
    
  5.8      Tax Withholding and Reporting. 
  (a)    To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, the Company shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law. 
    
  (b)    The Company shall have the right at its option to (i) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant s Deferral Accounts or (ii) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company  
  
   17 

credits to a Participant s Deferral Accounts. In addition, as permitted by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi) (or any successor provision), payments may be made under the Plan to pay any Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code Sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) on the Participant s Deferral Accounts, and to pay any income tax imposed under Code Section 3401 (  i.e.,   wage withholding) or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable state or local law as a result of payment of the FICA amount, as well as to pay the additional income tax attributable to the pyramiding wages and taxes. The total payment may not exceed the aggregate FICA tax amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax amount. 
    
  5.9      Reemployment. 
  (a)  If, after a Participant s Separation from Service, such Participant is reemployed by the Company prior to the payment of his benefits in a cash lump sum payment or while he is receiving benefits in the form of annual installment payments, the payment of the lump sum amount or the future installments, as the case may be, shall be made as scheduled without regard to the Participant s reemployment. 
  (b)  A reemployed Participant may elect to again participate in this Plan and to defer additional Base Salary and/or Bonus as provided in Section 4.1, in which case a new Deferral Account shall be established for such Participant to which allocations relating to the period following the Participant s re-employment shall be credited. The Participant also shall be permitted to file a new Distribution Election Form, simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that the Participant files upon his reemployment, governing the payment of his new Retirement Benefit in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and payment to his Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.2(c) (provided that payment of any amounts previously forfeited pursuant to Section 4.6 and restored upon the Participant s reemployment shall be made in the form applicable at the time of his prior termination in accordance with the rules set forth herein). 
  5.10      Qualified Divorce Orders.   Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Committee under Section 9.3(b) hereof and the provisions of this Plan, benefits may be paid from the balance of a Participant s Deferral Account(s) in accordance with a Qualified Divorce Order. 
  
   18 

5.11      Special 2006 Transition Rule Elections. 
  (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, pursuant to the transition rules under Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance thereunder, each Participant who has not separated from service as of October 12, 2006 may make a new payment election (a  Special Transition Rule Election ) with respect to (i) the balance of his Deferral Accounts as of December 31, 2006 together with interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his  December 31 Balance ) and/or (ii) any deferred 2006 bonus (i.e., that portion of any bonus earned in 2006 and payable in 2007 that the Participant elected to defer under this Plan) plus interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his  2006 Deferred Bonus ). As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive his Retirement Benefit in any form described in Section 5.1 and calculated under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. In addition, the Participant may elect up to two Early Payment Years with installment payments (if any) calculated under the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(b) or Section 5.4 to the contrary, a Participant may elect any Early Payment Year other than 2006 regardless of the year in which the Compensation was deferred, except that (i) the earliest Early Payment Year that a Participant may elect with respect to his 2006 Deferred Bonus is 2008, and (ii) if a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year with respect to his December 31 Balance, payment will be made in July of 2007. A Participant may elect that all, any portion or no portion of his December 31 Balance and/or all, any portion or no portion of his 2006 Deferred Bonus be paid in an Early Payment Year, but (i) the Participant may not select more than two Early Payment Years under this Special Transition Rule Election and may not elect any additional Early Payment Years under Section 4.1(b) if such election would result in more than two scheduled Early Payment Years and (ii) the Participant may not make different elections with respect to the form or manner of calculation of his Retirement Benefit with respect to his December 31 Balance and his 2006 Deferred Bonus. 
  (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has separated from service due to Retirement as of October 12, 2006, he may make a new payment election with respect to his December 31 Balance. As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive a lump sum distribution of his entire Deferral Account balance in July of 2007 or to change the number of Retirement Benefit installment payments as permitted under Section 5.1, provided that the Participant may not extend the number of installments to more than twenty annual installments (including installment payments that have already been made). 
  (c) If a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year for his December 31 Balance, he may not elect to defer any Compensation earned in 2007 under this Plan. 
  (d) In addition, as part of the special election under this Section 5.12, a Participant may change the form and manner of calculation of the payment of benefits to his Beneficiary in the event that the Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement. 
  (e) A Participant must elect the same form and manner of calculating his Retirement Benefit under (a) or (b) of this Section 5.12 and the same form and manner of calculating his Beneficiary Benefit under (d) of this Section 5.12 as he elects for such benefits under the 2005 DCP and the DCP2. 
  (f) Any election under this Section 5.12 must be made by November 3, 2006, or such later date as permitted by the Committee, but in no event later than December 31, 2006. 
  
   19 

(g) A Participant s election under this Section 5.12 shall supersede any previous election made or deemed to be made under this Plan, the 2005 DCP, or the DCP2. If a Participant does not timely make an election under this Section 5.12, the elections he otherwise made or makes or was deemed to make shall apply and may be changed only in accordance with the other terms of this Plan and any Compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2007, shall be subject to the Participant s election under the 2005 DCP (or, the DCP2 if the Participant was a participant in the DCP2 but not the 2005 DCP) or as subsequently amended in accordance with the other terms of this Plan. However, any distribution election that had not become effective by October 12, 2006, shall be null and void. 
  5.12      Section 409A Compliance.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any amount that would have been paid in 2008 under the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to November 1, 2008 shall be paid by December 31, 2008. No amount shall be paid in 2008 under the provisions of this November 1, 2008 restatement that would not have been paid in 2008 under the prior provisions of the Plan. 
    
  5.13      Plan Provisions Control. 
  (a)  Payment Commencement Prior to November 1, 2008.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if installment payments to a Participant or Beneficiary have commenced prior to November 1, 2008 in accordance with the prior provisions of the Plan, the Participant s remaining account shall be paid over the remaining number of installments in accordance with the rules set forth herein (i.e., within the first 90 days of 2009 and each subsequent calendar year, except as otherwise provided herein). 
  (b)  Distribution Elections Made Prior to November 1, 2008.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has made a distribution election, including a beneficiary distribution election, prior to November 1, 2008, and such election remains in effect on and after that date, including without limitation under Section 4.9 or Section 5.2(g), distributions to such Participant (or his Beneficiary) shall commence and be made in accordance with the rules set forth herein, with such distribution election used only to determine the applicable form of payment (i.e., whether distribution shall be made in a lump sum or installments and, if installments, the number of such installments and the method used for calculating such installments). 
  ARTICLE VI      BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 
  Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as the Beneficiary to whom payments under this Plan shall be made in the event of the Participant s death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant s lifetime on a paper form prescribed by the Committee. Any Beneficiary designation made by a Participant under the DCP2 and/or the 2005 DCP shall continue to apply under this Plan until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Participant had selected different Beneficiaries under the DCP2 and the 2005 DCP, the following rules shall apply: 
  (A)    If the Participant does not make a new election under Section 5.12, the Beneficiary designation under the DCP2 shall apply to the subaccount for the DCP2 under this Plan and the Beneficiary  
  
   20 

designation under the 2005 DCP shall apply to the subaccount for the 2005 DCP under this Plan unless or until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee. 
  (B)    If the Participant does make a new election under Section 5.12, the Participant will be treated as having no Beneficiary designation on file until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation with the Committee. 
  The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed. 
  If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, any benefits remaining unpaid shall be paid in accordance with the Participant s Beneficiary designation under the Company s Retirement Plan, and if there is no such valid Beneficiary designation, to the Participant s then surviving spouse, or if none, to the Participant s estate, unless directed otherwise by the court that has jurisdiction over the assets belonging to the Participant s probate estate. 
    
  ARTICLE VII      CLAIMS PROCEDURE 
  7.1      Applications for Benefits.   All applications for benefits under the Plan shall be submitted to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Attention: Deferred Compensation Plan Committee, 10889 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90024.

  7.2      Claims Procedure. 
  (a)  Within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 90 days after receipt of a claim for benefits, the Committee or its delegate shall notify the claimant of any adverse benefit determination on the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. In no event may the extension period exceed 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period. If an extension is necessary, the Committee or its delegate shall provide the claimant with a written notice to this effect prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day period. The notice shall describe the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Committee or its delegate expects to render a determination on the claim. 
  (b)  In the case of an adverse benefit determination, the Committee or its delegate shall provide to the claimant written or electronic notification setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse benefit determination; (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the adverse benefit determination is based; (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why the material or information is necessary; and (iv) a description of the Plan s claim review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse final benefit determination on review and in accordance with Section 7.4. 
  
   21 

(c)  Within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of notification of the adverse benefit determination, the claimant or his duly authorized representative, upon written application to the Committee, may request that the Committee fully and fairly review the adverse benefit determination. On review of an adverse benefit determination, upon request and free of charge, the claimant shall have reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits. The claimant shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. The Committee s (or delegate s) review shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted regardless of whether the information was previously considered in the initial adverse benefit determination. 
  (d)  Within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 60 days after receipt of such request for review, the Committee or its delegate shall notify the claimant of any final benefit determination on the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. In no event may the extension period exceed 60 days from the end of the initial 60-day period. If an extension is necessary, the Committee or its delegate shall provide the claimant with a written notice to this effect prior to the expiration of the initial 60-day period. The notice shall describe the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Committee or its delegate expects to render a final determination on the request for review. In the case of an adverse final benefit determination, the Committee or its delegate shall provide to the claimant written or electronic notification setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse final benefit determination; (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the adverse final benefit determination is based; (iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits; and (iv) a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse final benefit determination on review and in accordance with Section 7.4. 
  7.3      Section 409A Compliance.   Any claim for benefits under this Article must be made by the claimant no later than the time prescribed by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(g) (or any successor provision). If a claimant s claim or appeal is approved, any resulting payment of benefits will be made no later than the time prescribed for payment of benefits by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(g) (or any successor provision). 
  7.4      Limitations on Actions.   No legal action may be commenced prior to the completion of the benefit claims procedure described herein. In addition, no legal action may be commenced after the later of (a) 180 days after receiving the written response of the Committee to an appeal, or (b) 365 days after an applicant s original application for benefits. 
  
   22 

ARTICLE VIII      AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN 
  8.1      Amendment.   The Board may amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, tax, accounting or other changes, which may result in termination of the Plan for future deferrals. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board may amend the Plan to (a) ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Code Section 409A for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution and (b) add provisions for changes to deferral elections and elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution. The Committee appointed pursuant to Article III, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if the Committee determines that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease Plan benefits or costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for any amendment required to preserve the deferral of taxation of amounts deferred under this Plan, no amendment shall (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted; (b) eliminate the spousal survivor benefit under Section 5.3; or (c) change the definition of the Declared Rate set forth in Article II for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted, produces a rate that is less than the lesser of: (i) Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted), or (ii) the highest yield on any unsecured debt or preferred stock of the Company that was outstanding on the last day of the month immediately preceding the date such amendment is adopted. Any amendment that would either (a) reduce the Declared Rate for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted, produces a rate that is less than Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted) or (b) change the terms of the amendment provisions of this Section 8.1 or the terms of the termination provisions of Section 8.2, shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date such amendment is adopted, unless the amendment is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or the amendment is required in order to preclude any amounts deferred under this Plan from being included in the income of Participants prior to a date of distribution as specified under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Change in Control, no amendment shall (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted; (b) change the definition of the Declared Rate set forth in Article II for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the Change in Control, produces a rate that is less than Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the Change in Control); (c) eliminate the spousal survivor benefits under Section 5.3; or (d) change the terms of the amendment provisions of this Section 8.1 or the terms of the termination provisions of Section 8.2. 
  
   23 

8.2      Termination. 
  (a)  Company s Right to Terminate.   The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, if in the Board s judgment, the continuance of the Plan would not be in the Company s best interest due to tax, accounting or other effects thereof, or potential payouts thereunder, or other reasons, provided that any termination of the Plan shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date the Board adopts a resolution to terminate the Plan, unless (i) the termination of the Plan is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or (ii) the Participants have become subject to tax on the amounts deferred under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Change in Control, the Plan may not be terminated prior to the date that is three years after the date the Change in Control occurs, or, if earlier, the date on which amounts deferred under the Plan have become taxable to Participants. In the event the Board adopts a resolution terminating the Plan, the Board or the Committee shall determine the date as of which deferral elections shall cease to have effect in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
  (b)  Payments Upon Termination.   Distributions to the Participants or their Beneficiaries shall be made on the dates on which the Participants or their Beneficiaries would receive benefits hereunder without regard to the termination of the Plan, except that payments may, in the discretion of the Board, be accelerated if: 
  (A)  The Plan is terminated and liquidated pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Plan; 
  (B)  Accelerated payment is otherwise permitted by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (or any successor provision) or other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, or 
  (C)  The Plan is terminated because Participants have become subject to tax on their deferrals due to the Plan s failure to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A. Payment to a Participant may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure. 
    
  ARTICLE IX      MISCELLANEOUS 
  9.1      Unsecured General Creditor.   The rights of a Participant, Beneficiary, or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company, nor shall any assets of the Company be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises. 
  9.2      Trust Fund.   The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company s creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company. No assets shall be transferred to a trust if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code Section 409A(b). 
  
   24 

9.3      Nonassignability. 
  (a)  Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized. The Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Committee constitutes a Qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders. In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order. 
  9.4      Release from Liability to Participant.   A Participant s right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of a Participant s Deferral Account(s) has been paid or set side for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order. The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts, and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order. 
  9.5      Employment Not Guaranteed.   Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to be retained in employment with the Company. Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.  
  9.6      Gender, Singular   Plural.   All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine or feminine as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular. 
  
   25 

9.7      Captions.   The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions. 
  9.8      Validity.   In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan. 
  9.9      Notice.   Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company. Such notice shall be deemed given as to the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
  9.10      Applicable Law.   The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Code Section 409A, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and in accordance with the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.
