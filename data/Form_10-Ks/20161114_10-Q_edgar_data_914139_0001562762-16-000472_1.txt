(UNAUDITED) 

1.    Description of Business 

ParkerVision   ( w  e   or   the  Company ) is   in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies.   We design, develop and market our proprietary radio frequency ( RF ) technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products.    In addition, we offer engineering consulting and design services, for a negotiated fee, to assist customers in developing prototypes and/or products incorporating wireless technologies  .    

We believe   certain patents protecting   our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan   include  s     enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts.       

2.  Liquidity and Going Concern 

Our   consolidated   financial statements were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  These   consolidated f  inancial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In   January and July 2016  , we sold unregistered common stock in   two   private placement transaction  s     for   net proceeds of   approximately   $  3.8   million (see Note 10).   In addition, in   2016  , we received an aggregate of   $13   million in funding from a litigation funding party,   Brickell Key Investments ( BKI ).  Of the funding received,   $2   million was for general working capital purposes and the remaining   $11   million   wa  s restricted for payment of legal fees and expenses in connection with our proceedings at the International Trade Commission ( ITC ) and related   international   patent actions (see Note 8).    Our fee arrangements with regard to the ITC and related proceedings provide for fee caps such that our legal fees and expenses to prosecute these actions are not expected to exceed the restricted funds received.        We received approximately   $3.3   million in   net   proceeds from a patent license and settlement agreement in August 2016  .  T  hese proceeds were used to repay a portion of the BKI funding. 		 

At   September   30  , 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of approximately   $  1.1   million and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $  2.7   million.  We used approximately   $  11.8   million of cash for operations   during the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016, of which approximately   $  8.  3   million was funded from restricted cash and cash equivalents   for our ITC and related proceedings  .  Our unrestricted capital resources at   September   30  , 2016   will   not be   sufficient to support our   working capital   requirements for   the next twelve months  . This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   		 

6   

Our ability to meet our operating costs for 2016   and beyond   is dependent upon our ability to (i) successfully negotiate licensing agreements and/or settlements   relating to   the use of our technologies by others and/or (ii) our ability to develop, market and sell existing and new products.    Funds received from   future patent license and litigation settlement agreements will first be designated for repayment of our secured contingent payment obligation  .    Thereafter, any remaining revenues from patent-related activities will be subject to prorated contingent payments to third-parties, including legal counsel.        We expect that revenue generated from patent enforcement actions, technology licenses and/or the sale of products in 2016   will   not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and our secured contingent repayment obligations.      		 

We expect to continue to invest in patent prosecution and enforcement, product development, and sales, marketing, and customer support for our technologies and products.   The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and/or products to offset expenses and contingent payment obligations.  In the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues, we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or contingent fee arrangements and/or reduce operating costs.  Failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings or contingent fee arrangements, and/or reduce operating costs will have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business objectives. 

3.  Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited   consolidated   financial statements for the period ended   September   30  , 2016   were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Operating results for the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016     are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 201  6   or future years.    Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period   amounts to conform to the current period presentation.        All prior period references in these   unaudited   consolidated   financial statements to number of shares, price per share and weighted average shares of common stock have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the one-for-ten reverse stock split that went into effect on March 30, 2016.        All normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair   statement   of the financial condition and results of   operations have been included. 		 

The year-end   consolidated   balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements   for the year ended December 31, 201  5  , but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    These interim   consolidated   financial statements should be read in conjunction with our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  .   

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ParkerVision, Inc. and its wholly-owned   German   subsidiary, ParkerVision GmbH (collectively,  ParkerVision ) after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.

4.  Accounting Policies 

There have been no changes in accounting policies from those stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   the year ended December 31, 2015,   except as follows: 

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand and money market investments that are restricted for specific use in payment of legal fees and expenses related to certain of our patent infringement actions.  The restricted money market investments have   weighted average   maturities of three months or less when purchased and are recorded at fair value.  We have determined that the fair value of our restricted money market investments fall within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (see Note 11).   

Secured Contingent Payment Obligation 

We have accounted for our secured contingent repayment obligation as long-term debt in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 470-10-25,  Sales of Future Revenues or Various other Measures of Income.  Our repayment obligations are contingent upon the receipt of proceeds from patent enforcement and/or patent monetization actions.   We have elected to measure our secured contingent payment obligation at its fair value in accordance with ASC 825,  Financial Instruments  based on the variable and contingent nature of the repayment provisions. We have determined that the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation falls within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy which involves significant estimates and assumptions including projected future patent-related proceeds and the risk-adjusted rate for discounting future cash flows (see Note 11).  Actual results could differ from the estimates made. Changes in fair value, including the component related to imputed interest,   are   included in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss under the heading    Change in fair value of contingent payment obligation   . 		 

Revenue Recognition 

We derive revenue from licensing of our intellectual property, settlements from patent infringement disputes, sales of integrated circuit products, and engineering services.  The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations.  In general, we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the amounts are fixed and determinable and the collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time of shipment to the customer or when the other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later.  Revenue from providing services is recognized when earned.  Unearned revenue consists of product inventory held by a distributor and retainer payments received on services contracts.   

The consideration received from patent license and settlement agreements is allocated to the various elements of the arrangement to the extent the revenue recognition differs between the elements of the arrangement.  Elements related to past and future royalties as well as elements related to settlement will be recorded   as   revenue in our consolidated statement of   comprehensive loss   when earned.  We recognize revenues upon execution of a patent license and settlement agreement by both parties provided that the amounts are fixed and determinable, there are no significant undelivered obligations and collectability is reasonably assured.  We do not recognize any revenue prior to the execution of an agreement as there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts related to the elements of the arrangement, or assess collectability.   In addition, we do not recognize as revenue any consideration in the agreement that is contingent upon the occurrence of future events until such time that those future events occur.

Accounting for Share-Based Compensation 

In April 2016, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,      Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09   simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations.  We have elected to account for forfeitures of share-based equity awards as they occur.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements except for the reclassification of the value of shares withheld for payment of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. 		 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In   August   2016, we early adopted FASB ASU 2016-15      Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.           This update provides guidance on the presentation and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows  . The adoption of ASU 2016-15 had no effect on our current or prior period consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, we early adopted, on a retrospective basis, FASB ASU 2015-17  Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) , issued in November 2015.   ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.  Given the existence of a full valuation allowance for all periods presented, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 had no effect on our current or prior period consolidated financial statements.   

In April 2016, we early adopted FASB ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)  issued in July 2015.  ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting for the valuation of all inventory not accounted for using the last-in, first-out method by prescribing inventory be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 had no impact on our consolidated financial   statements  . 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases,  to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.    Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for capital and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15    Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,     to provide guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  W  e    are   currently formalizing processes   and controls to assess risk, determine the level of analysis necessary and to perform our going concern assessment in accordance with ASU 2014-15. 		 

9   

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,      Revenue from Contracts with Customers.     ASU 2014-09 implements a common revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue.  This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.    ASU 2015-14,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,   issued in August 2015, defers adoption of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is not permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.     		 

5  .    Loss per Common Share 

Basic loss per common share is determined based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share as all common share equivalents are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.  

O  ptions and warrants to purchase     1,025,846     and   1  ,  308  ,  66  9     shares   of common stock were outstanding at   September   30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  In addition, unvested restricted stock units ( RSUs ), representing     325,000   and     75  ,  83  4     shares of common stock, were outstanding at   September   30, 2016   and 2015, respectively  .   These options, warrants and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per common share as their effect would have been anti-dilut  ive.       		 

6  .       Inventories 

Inventories consist of the following  :    

7  .  Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist of the following:  

10   

8.  Long-Term Debt 

Note Payable to a Related Party 

A  t    September   30  , 2016  , we had an   unsecured promissory note payable to a related party for unpaid legal fees   of   $825,000  .   Interest on the note is payable monthly on the outstanding principal balance at a rate of   8%   per annum.  The note matures on   December 31, 2017   and early prepayment of all or any portion of the principal balance is allowed without penalty.    As of   September   30  , 2016, the estimated fair value of our note payable is approximately   $  7  34  ,000   based on a risk-adjusted discount rate  . 		 

Failure to comply with the   payment   terms of this note constitutes an event of default which, if uncured, will result in the entire unpaid principal balance of the note and any unpaid, accrued interest to become immediately due and payable.   As of   September   30  , 2016, we are in compliance with   the payment term  s of the note.  

Secured Contingent Payment Obligation 

On February 25, 2016, we entered into a litigation funding arrangement with BKI, a special purpose fund under the management of Juridica Asset Management Limited.  Under the agreement, we received aggregate proceeds of   $11   million in exchange for BKI s right to reimbursement and compensation from gross proceeds resulting from patent enforcement and other patent monetization actions.  In connection with the agreement, we issued BKI a warrant to purchase up to   250,000   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $3.50   per share valued at its estimated fair market value of   $  1  55,625   using a   discounted   Black-Scholes model  . 		 

In May 2016, we received additional proceeds of   $2   million from BKI.  In connection with the additional proceeds, we exchanged   the   original w  arrant for a new warrant to purchase up to   350,000   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $2.00   per share.    We   estimated the incremental fair value of the   new warrant   of   $179,3  05   using a   discounted Black-Scholes model  .    The aggregate fair value of the   BKI   w  arrant   is     $334,930     and is   included in shareholders      (  deficit  ) equity   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at   September   30, 2016. 		 

Under the agreement  s  , $1  1   million of the   aggregate   proceeds are restricted for use in payment of our legal fees and expenses in connection with the legal proceedings filed   at the ITC   in December 2015   and legal proceedings filed in Germany in June 2016   (the  Funded Actions ).  These proceeds, net of funds used to pay allowable expenses or funds paid on retainer, are recorded as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our accompanying   consolidated   balance sheet   at   September   30  , 2016  .    		 

BKI is entitled to priority payment of   100%   of proceeds   received   from all patent-related actions until such time that BKI has been repaid in full.  After repayment of the funded amount, BKI is entitled to a portion of remaining proceeds up to a specified minimum return which is determined as a percentage of the funded amount and varies based on the timing of repayment.  In addition, BKI is entitled to a pro rata portion of proceeds solely from the Funded Actions to the extent   aggregate proceeds from the   Funded Action  s   exceed the specified minimum return. 		 

11   

We granted BKI a senior security interest in our assets until such time as the specified minimum return is paid, in which case, the security interest will be released except with respect to the patents and proceeds directly related to Funded Actions.  The security interest is enforceable by BKI in the event that we are in default under the agreement which would occur if (i) we fail, after notice, to pay proceeds to BKI, (ii) we become insolvent or insolvency proceedings are commenced (and not subsequently discharged) with respect to us, (iii) our creditors commence actions against us (which are not subsequently discharged) that affect our material assets, (iv) we, without BKI s consent, incur indebtedness other than immaterial ordinary course indebtedness, or (v) there is an uncured non-compliance of our obligations or misrepresentations under   the agreement.   As of   September   30  , 2016, we are in compliance with our obligations under this agreement. 		 

We have elected to measure our secured contingent payment obligatio  n at fair value   based on probability-weighted estimated cash outflows, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods  .    The secured contingent payment obligation is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss until the contingency is resolved.    As of   September   30  , 2016, the fair value of the obligation is estimated to be   $  1  2,357,697   (see Note 11). 		 

9.  Share-Based Compensation  

There has been no material change in the assumptions used to compute the fair value of our equity awards, nor in the method used to account for sha  re-based compensation from those stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5, except for the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as discussed in Note 4  .   

The following table presents share-based compensation expense included in our   consolidated   statements of   comprehensive loss   for the   three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively: 

On August 15, 2016, we granted an aggregate of   200,000   restricted stock units ( RSU ) with a total grant date fair value of   $1,226,000   to our non-employee directors.    One-half     of the RSUs   vested   upon grant   and the remaining half vest on August 15, 2017.  Also on August 15, 2016, we granted an aggregate of   30  0,000   RSUs with a total grant date fair value of   $1,  839  ,000   to   employees, including certain of our named executive officers  .    These   RSUs   vest in   four  , equal   quarter  ly     increments beginning on September 1, 2016  .     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   approximately   $1,860,000   in   unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximatel  y    one   year  . 		 

On August 12, 2016, our shareholders approved an amendment to our 2011 Long-Term   Incentive   Equity  Plan   to   increase the shares authorized for issuance under the plan from   1,200,000   to   1,950,000   shares.    As of September 30, 2016, we have an aggregate of   815,877   available for grant under approved equity plans.

10  .  Stock Authorization and Issuance 

On August 17, 2016, we amended our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from   15,000,000   to   20,000,000   shares.  This amendment was approved by our shareholders on August 12, 2016.    

On January 25, 2016, we sold   454,546   shares of our common stock at a price of   $2.20   per share to an accredited investor in a private placement transaction generating gross proceeds of approximately   $1,000,000  .  We   ha  ve     no registration obligations with respect to these shares.   

On February 25, 2016, we issued a warrant to BKI for the purchase of up to 250,000 shares of our common stock in conjunction with their financing arrangement with us (see Note 8).  The warrant had an exercise price of $3.50 per share, was exercisable for   five   years from the date of issuance, and had piggy-back registration rights of the underlying warrant shares.  On May 27, 2016, in connection with an additional financing arrangement with BKI (see Note 8), the warrant was exchanged for a new warrant for the purchase of up to 350,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.  The new warrant is exercisable for five years from the date of issuance and has piggy-back registration rights of the underlying warrant shares.  The shares underlying the warrants were registered on a registration statement that was declared effective on August 2, 2016 (File No. 333-212670).    		 

On March 29, 2016, we effected a   one-for-ten   reverse stock split of our common stock, and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ capital market on a post-split basis at the open of business on March 30, 2016. As a result of the reverse stock split, every ten shares of our common stock was combined into one share of our common stock.  No fractional shares of our common stock were issued in connection with the reverse stock split.  Any fractional shares created as a result of the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next largest whole number.  The par value and other terms of our common stock   were   not affected by the reverse stock split.  However, the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue was proportionately reduced from   150,000,000   shares to   15,000,000  . 		 

On April 12, 2016,   we issued   200,000   shares of unregistered common stock to   an   outside   consultant   in exchange for a   $310,000   prepaid retainer for consulting services.    We have no registration obligation with respect to these shares. 

In July 2016, we sold   1,090,909   shares of our common stock at a price of   $2.75   per share to an accredited investor in a private placement transaction generating   gross   proceeds of approximately   3,0  00,000  .  We filed a registration statement on July 25, 2016 to register the resale of the common stock and the registration statement was declared effective on August 2, 2016 (File No. 333-212670).   

In July 2016, we also exchanged warrants issued in 2015 to 1624 PV, LLC ( 1624 ) for a new warrant.  We exchanged   three   common stock   purchase warrants,   each entitling 1624 to acquire up to   188,406   shares of our common stock at exercise prices of   $15  ,    $25   and   $35  , respectively for a new warrant entitling 1624 to acquire up to   200,000   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $3.25   per share with an expiration date of   June 16, 2018  .  All other terms of the warrant remained unchanged. As a result of this warrant exchange, the number of shares of our common stock subject to warrants decreased by   365,218   shares   and we recognized incremental compensation cost of approximately   $103,000   which is included in share-based compensation expense  .    We   file  d   a post-effective amendment to the previously filed S-3 registration statement (File No. 333-202802) covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants.  This post-effective amendment was declared effective on August 3, 2016  . 		 

13   

On   September 1  , 2016,   we issued   45,000   shares of unregistered common stock to   an   outside   consultant     i  n exchange for a   $120,000   prepaid retainer for   executive consulting and advisory   services.    We have no registration obligation with respect to these shares. 		 

11  . Fa  ir Value Measurements 

ASC 820,  Fair Value Measures  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs: 

Level 1:  Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which we can access     

Level 2:  Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1     

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs     

We determine the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and restricted cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs).  We measure our secured contingent payment obligation at its estimated fair value using an income approach based on the estimated present value of projected future cash outflows (Level 3 inputs).  Increases or decreases in the unobservable Level 3 inputs would result in higher or lower fair value measurement.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had   no   transfers of assets or   liabilities   between the levels of the hierarchy. 		 

The following table  s   summarize the fair value of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30  , 2016   and December 31, 2015  : 

14   

Changes in the fair value of our Level 3 secured contingent payment obligation for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 were as follows  : 

1- Recorded net of $334,930 fair value assigned to the warrants issued in connection with the transaction (see Note 8). 

12  .  Commitments and Contingencies 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business.  These proceedings include patent enforcement actions initiated by us against others for the infringement of our technologies, as well as proceedings brought by others against us at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTAB ) in an attempt to invalidate certain of our patent claims.   These patent-related proceedings are more fully described below.     Although there is at least a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable outcome in any one or more of these matters, we believe that any such outcome is not expected to have a material im  pact on our financial position or   results of operation  s  . 		 

ParkerVision vs. Qualcomm, Inc. 

On July 20, 2011, we filed a patent infringement action in the United States District Court of the Middle District of Florida (the  Middle District of Florida ) against Qualcomm Incorporated ( Qualcomm ) seeking damages and injunctive relief for infringement of several of our patents related to radio-frequency receivers and the down-conversion of electromagnetic signals.  Qualcomm filed a counterclaim against us alleging invalidity and unenforceability of each of our patents.  In October 2013, a jury found that all of Qualcomm s accused products directly and indirectly infringed all   eleven   claims of the   four   patents asserted by us and awarded us   $172.7   million in damages.  The jury also found that Qualcomm did not prove its claims of invalidity for any of the eleven claims of the four patents in the case, and furthermore found that we did not prove our claims of willfulness, which would have allowed enhancement of the jury-awarded damages.  On June 20, 2014, a final district court ruling was issued in which the court overturned the jury s verdict of infringement thus nullifying the damages award.  We appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) and  Qualcomm filed a counter-appeal on the issues of validity and damages.  On July 31, 2015, the appellate court upheld the district court s determination of non-infringement and overturned the district court s decision on validity, ruling that   ten   of the eleven patent claims in the case were invalid.  On October 2, 2015, the CAFC denied our petition for a rehearing with respect to infringement of the one claim that was not invalidated by the CAFC.  On February 29, 2016, we filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the United States ( Supreme Court ) in this matter.  On March 28, 2016, the Supreme Court denied our petition requesting a review of the appellate court s decision.  We have no further appeals available to us in this action.

ParkerVision vs. Qualcomm, HTC, and Samsung 

On May 1, 2014, we filed a complaint in the Middle District of Florida against Qualcomm, Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., and HTC (HTC Corporation and HTC America, Inc) (the  Qualcomm Action ) seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief for infringement of   seven   of our patents related to RF up-conversion, systems for control of multi-mode, multi-band communications, baseband innovations including control and system calibration, and wireless protocol conversion. On August 21, 2014, we amended our complaint adding Samsung as a defendant.  We also added infringement claims of   four   additional patents to this case.  On November 17, 2014, certain of the defendants filed counterclaims of non-infringement and invalidity for all patents in the case.  A claim construction hearing was held on August 12, 2015 but no ruling on claim construction has been issued by the court.   In January 2016, the court granted the parties  joint motion to dismiss claims and counterclaims related to   six   patents in the case in order to narrow the scope of the litigation.  In February 2016, the court granted the parties  joint motion to stay these proceedings until resolution of the proceedings at the ITC as discussed below.  In July 2016, we entered into a confidential patent license and settlement agreement with Samsung and, as a result, the court granted our motion to remove Samsung from these proceedings.  		 

Qualcomm Inc. and Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. vs. ParkerVision 

On August 27, 2015, Qualcomm, Inc. and Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. filed   an   aggregate of   ten   petitions for   Inter partes   review ( IPR ) with the PTAB seeking to invalidate certain claims related to three of the eleven patents originally asserted in our Qualcomm Action.  We filed preliminary responses to these petitions in December 2015. In March 2016, the PTAB issued decisions denying institution of trial for   three   of the petitions, all of which relate to our U.S. patent 7,039,372 ( the  372 Patent ) and instituting trial for the remaining petitions, all of which relate to our U.S. patent 6,091,940 (the  940 Patent ) and U.S. patent 7,966,012 ( the  012 Patent ).   The  372 Patent and the  940 Patent are among the patents asserted in the Qualcomm Actio  n.  On May 2, 2016, we entered a motion disclaiming the challenged claims of the  012 Patent and, on May 5, 2016, the PTAB granted our motion and entered an adverse judgment against us with respect to those claims.   Our responses to the remaining petitions that were instituted for trial were   filed   in   May 2016 and replies from Qualcomm   were filed in September   2016.    Oral arguments with regard to the remaining claims in the  940 patent are scheduled for November 29, 2016.   		 

ParkerVision v. Apple, LG, Samsung and Qualcomm 

On December 15, 2015, we filed a complaint with the United States ITC against Apple, Inc., LG Electronics, Inc., LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc., and LG Electronics MobileComm U.S.A., Inc., (collectively,  LG ), Samsung and Qualcomm alleging that these companies have engaged in unfair trade practices by unlawfully importing into the U.S. and selling various products that infringe   certain   of our patents.  We also requested that the ITC bar the defendants from continuing to import and sell infringing products in the U.S.  In December 2015, we also filed a corresponding patent infringement complaint in the Middle District of Florida against these same defendants seeking undisclosed damages for the alleged infringement of the same patents.   In January 2016, the ITC instituted an investigation based on our complaint. In February 2016, the district court proceedings were stayed pending resolution of the proceedings at the ITC.  In July 2016, we entered into a confidential patent license and settlement agreement with Samsung and, as a result, Samsung has been removed from both the ITC and related district court action.   The ITC hearing with regard to the remaining defendants is scheduled for March 2017.     		 

16   

ParkerVision v. LG 

In June 2016, we filed a complaint in Munich Regional Court against LG Electronics Deutschland GmbH, a German subsidiary of LG Electronics, Inc. ( LG ) seeking damages and injunctive relief for the alleged infringement of one of our German patents. A hearing in this case was held on November 10, 2016.      On November 14, 2016, the court concluded that certain LG products using Qualcomm RF circuitry infringe our patent.  Subject to successful completion of the co-pending nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court in Munich, the regional court will enjoin the sale and importation of these LG products in Germany.  The nullity action is a validity only challenge and a ruling in the nullity proceeding is expected as early as the first half of 2017.  

ParkerVision v. Apple 

In October 2016, we filed a complaint in Munich Regional Court against Apple, Inc., Apple Distribution International, and Apple Retail Germany B.V.   Co. KG (collectively,  Apple ) seeking damages and injunctive relief for the alleged infringement of the same German patent as in the LG case.  A hearing has been scheduled for May 2017.

IT    EM 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our shareholders and to the public.  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our future plans, objectives, and expectations contained in this Item.  When used in this quarterly report and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the words or phrases  expects ,  will likely result ,  will continue ,  is anticipated ,  estimated  or similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking statements.   Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made.  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those presently anticipated or projected, including the risks and uncertainties identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fis  cal year ended December 31, 2015   (the  Annual Report ) and in this Item 2 of Part I of this quarterly report.  Examples of such risks and uncertainties include general economic and business conditions, competition, unexpected changes in technologies and technological advances, the timely development and commercial acceptance of new products and technologies, reliance on key business and sales relationships, reliance on our intellectual property, the outcome of our intellectual property litigation and the ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  We have no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.

Overview 

We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies.   We design, develop and market our proprietary radio frequency ( RF ) technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products.   We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan includes enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts. 

18   

We have a three-part growth strategy that includes   product and component sales and design services,   intellectual property licensing and/or product ventures,   and   intellectual property enforcement.  We have made significant investments in developing and protecting our technologies and products, the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues from   product sales and/or   licensing for realization.   

Recent Events 

German Patent Infringement Case Against LG  

On November 14, 2016, following a November 10, 2016 hearing, the Munich regional district court confirmed its September     preliminary opinion concluding that certain LG products using Qualcomm RF circuits infringe a ParkerVision wireless transmitter patent. Subject to successful completion of the co-pending nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court in Munich, the regional court will enjoin the sale and importation of LG products in Germany. The nullity action before the German Federal Patent Court is a validity only challenge.  A ruling in the nullity proceeding is expected as early as the first half of 2017. 

Patent License and Settlement Agreement with Samsung 

On July 15, 2016, we entered into a patent license and settlement agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its affiliates ( Samsung ).  Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Samsung a perpetual, worldwide license to our current patent portfolio, subject to certain exclusions.   We also agreed to terminate Samsung from the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) investigation and to dismiss our claims against Samsung in two district court cases.   Refer to  Legal Proceedings  in Note   12   to the   condensed consolidated   financial statements included in   this quarterly report   for a further discussion of these cases.    We recognized revenue from Samsung during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with this agreement  .        Additional amounts may be received in the future related to this agreement that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 		 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At   September   30, 2016, our capital resources consisted of approximately   $1.1 m  illion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and approximately   $2.7   million in restricted cash and cash equivalents.   The restricted cash and cash equivalents represents the unused portion of the re  stricted funds received from BKI  .    

We used cash for operations of approximately   $2.9 million and $11.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, of which $2.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively, was   funded from restricted cash and cash equivalents.   Our arrangements with   our attorneys for   the ITC and related proceedings provide for fee caps such that our   legal fees and expenses are not expected to   exceed the restricted funds received.    However, o  ur unrestricted capital resources at   September 30  , 2016  , are not   sufficient to support our   working capital   requirements for   the next twelve months   which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 		 

Our repayment obligation to BKI is recorded as a long-term liability in our accompanying   consolidated   balance sheets and is measured at its estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period.     We repaid $3.3 million of this obligation during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    As of   September   30, 2016, the fair value of the   remaining   obligation is estimated to b  e $12,3  57,697  .  In addition, we have an unsecured promissory note for $825,000 t  o a related party that matures on   December   31,   2017.   		 

19   

Our ability to meet our operating costs for 2016 is dependent upon our ability to (i) successfully negotiate licensing agreements and/or settlements for the use of our technologies by others and/or (ii) our ability to develop, market and sell existing and new products.    Funds received from future patent license and litigation settlement agreements will first be designated for repayment of our secured contingent payment obligation.    Thereafter, any remaining revenues from patent-related activities will be subject to prorated contingent payments to third-parties, including legal counsel.    In general, we   expect that revenue generated from patent enforcement actions, technology licenses and/or the sale of products   and the sale of services   in 2016   will   not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and our secured contingent repayment obligations.   		 

We expect to continue to invest in patent prosecution and enforcement, product development, and sales, marketing, and customer support for our technologies and products.   The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and/or products to offset expenses and contingent payment obligations.  In the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues, we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or contingent fee arrangements and/or reduce operating costs.  Failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings or contingent fee arrangements, and/or reduce operating costs will have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business objectives. 

Results of Operations for Each of the Three and   Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 

We use both generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and non-GAAP financial measures for assessing our consolidated results of operations.  The non-GAAP measures we use include Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share.  These non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on net loss and net loss per share of (i) changes in fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation and (ii) share-based compensation expense.  Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense item that is subject to significant fluctuation in value based on the volatility of the market price of our common stock, and the expense recognized on a GAAP basis is not necessarily indicative of the compensation realized by our executives, employees and non-employee directors.   The change in fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation is subject to significant estimates and assumptions regarding future events and, similar to interest on long-term debt obligations, is a reflection of our cost of financing rather than our operating activities.  Accordingly, we consider these non-GAAP measures to provide relevant supplemental information to assist investors in better understanding our operating results.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.   		 

Refer to  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  in this section for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Revenue and Gross Margin 

Our revenue increased approximately $3,995,000 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, our revenue increased approximately $4,059,000 when compared to the same period in 2015.   

Our gross margin increased approximately $3,699,000 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, our gross margin increased approximately $3,722,000 when compared to the same period in 2015.   Cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of patent amortization expense.   

20   

The increase in revenue and margin for both the three and nine month periods is the result of licensing and settlement revenue and related cost recognized in the third quarter of 2016.        

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, our revenue consisted primarily of product and service revenue.  Our cost of sales for product and services   include  d     the   cost of materials  ,    labor and overhead incurred under   our   engineering   services   contracts.   

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering and related management and support personnel costs; fees for outside engineering design services which we use from time to time to supplement our internal resources; depreciation expense related to our assets used in product development; prototype production and materials costs, which represent the fabrication and packaging costs for prototype integrated circuits, as well as the cost of supporting components for prototype board development; software licensing and support costs, which represent the annual licensing and support maintenance for engineering design and other software tools; and rent and other overhead costs for our engineering design facility.  Personnel costs include share-based compensation amounts which have been determined based on the grant date fair value of equity-based awards to our employees and then recorded to expense over the vesting period of the award.   		 

Our research and development expenses   in  creased approximately $  261,000  , or   32  %, during the three months ended   September   30, 2016 when compared to the sa  me period in 2015.  This is primarily the result of an increase in share-based compensation as a result of new awards granted to engineering executives and employees in August 2016.   

Our research and development expenses decreased approximately $  1,190,000  , or   32  %, during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.    This decrease is   primarily due to a reduction in personnel and related expenses   following   a June 2015 workforce reduction. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive, director, sales and marketing, and finance and administrative personnel costs, including share-based compensation,     and costs incurred for insurance, shareholder relations and outside legal and professional services, including litigation expenses.   

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $  1,248,000   or   54  %,   during the three months ended   September   30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.    This is the result of an increase in litigation fees and expenses of approximately $565,000 and an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately $981,000, partially offset by a $279,000 decrease in amortization expense  .      

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $  3,274,000   or   33  %,   during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  This is the result of an increase in litigation fees   and expenses   of approximately $  3,925,000 and an increase in   share-based compensation expense of approximately $  230,000, partially offset by a   decrease in personnel and related expenses of approximately $  519,000 and a decrease in amortization expense of approximately $270,000  . 		 

The increase in litigation related fees and expenses for three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 is   the result of increased patent-  related legal activities to support our ITC case and our German litigation   (see Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report)  .  These increased costs are   primarily   funded from our restricted cash and cash equivalents.  

21   

The increase in share-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the result of equity awards granted to directors and executives in August 2016, partially offset by   a decrease in expense attribution related to executive long-term equity incentive awards from prior years that became fully vested in mid-2015.  The decrease in personnel and related expenses is primarily the result of our June 2015 reduction in workforce.   

The decrease in amortization expense for the three and nine month periods is due to the inclusion of patent amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 in cost of sales. 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Payment Obligation    

We have elected to measure our secured contingent payment obligation at fair value which is based on significant unobservable inputs.  We estimated the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation using an income approach based on the estimated present value of projected future cash outflows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.  Increases or decreases in the significant unobservable inputs could result in significant increases or decreases in fair value.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation increased by approximately $726,000 and $3,033,000, respectively.  This increase is a result of changes in the estimated timing and amount of projected future cash outflows resulting from the funded actions.  

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share 

Adjusted net loss decreased by approximately $2.8 million, or 94%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease in adjusted net loss is a result of t  he increase in revenue,   somewhat offset by increases in litigation fees and expenses related primarily to our ITC action.   On a per share basis, our adjusted net loss per common share decreased by $0.29 per share, or 97%.   This decrease is a result of the decrease in our adjusted net loss and a 30% increase in our weighted average common shares outstanding.   

Adjusted net loss decreased by approximately $1.4 million, or 11%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease in adjusted net loss for the nine month period is a result of the increase in revenue and a decrease in personnel and related costs, largely offset by increases in litigation fees and expenses related primarily to our ITC action.   On a per share basis, our adjusted net loss per common share decreased by $0.34 per share, or 26%.   This decrease is a result of the decrease in our adjusted net loss and a 22% increase in our weighted average common shares outstanding.

The following table presents a   reconciliation of our net loss   per common share   to the non-GAAP measure of adjusted net loss   per common share   for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  : 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions, Arrangements and Other Relationships 

As of September   30, 2016, we had outstanding warrants to purchase   420,000   shares of our common stock.  The estimated grant date fair value of these warrants of $  826,006   is included in shareholders  equity in our   consolidated   balance sheets.    The outstanding warrants have an average exercise price of $2.21 per share and a weighted average remaining life of approximately 4 years. 

Contractual Obligations 

There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations as set forth in our Annual Report, except as follows: 

In February 2016, we converted $825,000 in current liabilities   payable   to a related party to an unsecured promissory note.   Interest on the note is payable monthly on the outstanding principal balance at a rate of 8% per annum and the note matures on December 31, 2017. 

Also  ,   in February 2016, as amended in May 2016, we entered into a litigation funding agreement with BKI whereby we received proceeds of $13 million in   exchange for BKI s right to reimbursement and compensation from gross proceeds resulting from patent enforcement and other patent monetization actions.  The amount and timing of our repayment obligation is dependent upon the amount and timing of proceeds received by us for patent-related activities.    We repaid approximately $3.3 million of this obligation during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The estimated fair market value of the remaining obligation as of September 30, 2016 is approximately $12.4 million  . 		 

23   

Critical Accounting Policies 

There have been no   changes in accounting policies from those stated in   our   Annual Report  , except as follows: 

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand and money market investments that are restricted for specific use in payment of legal fees and expenses related to   certain of   our patent infringement actions.  The restricted money market investments have   weighted average   maturities of three months or less when purchased and are recorded at fair value.   

Secured Contingent Payment Obligation 

We have accounted for our secured contingent repayment obligation as long-term debt in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 470-10-25,  Sales of Future Revenues or Various other Measures of Income.  Our repayment obligations are contingent upon the receipt of proceeds from patent enforcement and/or patent monetization actions.   We have elected to measure our secured contingent payment obligation at its fair value in accordance with ASC 825,  Financial Instruments  based on the variable and contingent nature of the repayment provisions. We have determined that the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligation falls within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy which involves significant estimates and assumptions including projected future patent-related proceeds and the risk-adjusted rate for discounting future cash flows.  Actual results could differ from the estimates made.  		 

Revenue Recognition 

We derive revenue from licensing of our intellectual property, settlements from patent infringement disputes, sales of integrated circuit products, and engineering services.  The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations.  In general, we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the amounts are fixed and determinable and the collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time of shipment to the customer or when the other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later.  Revenue from providing services is recognized when earned.  Unearned revenue consists of product inventory held by a distributor and retainer payments received on services contracts.   

The consideration received from patent license and settlement agreements is allocated to the various elements of the arrangement to the extent the revenue recognition differs between the elements of the arrangement.  Elements related to past and future royalties as well as elements related to settlement will be recorded as revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss when earned.  We recognize revenues upon execution of a patent license and settlement agreement by both parties provided that the amounts are fixed and determinable, there are no significant undelivered obligations and collectability is reasonably assured.  We do not recognize any revenue prior to the execution of an agreement as there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts related to the elements of the arrangement, or assess collectability.   In addition, we do not recognize as revenue any consideration in the agreement that is contingent upon the occurrence of future events until such time that those future events occur.    		 

Accounting for Share-Based Compensation 

In   April   2016,   we adopted   the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,      Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09   simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of  

24   

cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations.    We have elected to account for forfeitures of share-based equity awards as they occur  .    The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements except for the reclassification of the value of shares withheld for payment of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. 

IT    EM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

For the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes from the market risk information disclosed under Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report.    We are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position.  We have assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies which are remeasured at each reporting period.  Any gains or losses recognized for changes in currency exchange rates are included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.  We do not consider the market risk from changes in currency exchange rates to be material. 		 

ITE    M 4.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)   and 15d-15(e)   under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).   Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .   

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

SETTLEMENT AND PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT 

This Settlement and Patent License Agreement (   Agreement   ) is made as of July 1, 2016 (   Effective Date   ) between Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a Korean corporation having its principal place of business at 129 Samsung-ro (Maetan-dong), Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (as defined below) (collectively,    Samsung   ) and ParkerVision, Inc., a Florida corporation having its principal place of business at 7915 Baymeadows Way, Suite 400, Jacksonville, FL 32256, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively,    ParkerVision   ).

P  arkerVision   Reports Third Quarter 2016 Results 

Decision Reached in German case against LG 

Management to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. ET 

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., November 14, 2016       ParkerVision, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRKR)  , a developer and marketer of semiconductor technology solutions for wireless applications, today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Third Quarter 2016 Summary and Recent Developments 

Received ruling from Munich Regional Court in the patent infringement case against a German subsidiary of LG Electronics, Inc. ( LG ).  Confirming its September 2016 preliminary opinion, the court concluded that certain LG products using Qualcomm RF circuits infringe a ParkerVision wireless transmitter patent.  Subject to successful completion of the co-pending nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court in Munich, the regional court will enjoin the sale and importation of the infringing LG products in Germany.  The nullity action before the German Federal Patent Court is a validity only challenge and a preliminary ruling in this proceeding is expected as early as the first half of 2017.     

Filed a complaint in Munich Regional Court against Apple, Inc. and related entities in October 2016 alleging infringement of the same German patent in the LG case.  The hearing is scheduled for May 2017.     

Entered into a patent license and settle  ment agreement with Samsung in   the third quarter of 2016.     

Hearing at International Trade Commission rescheduled for March 2017 in pending case against LG, Apple and Qualcomm with final settlement conferences scheduled for February 2017.     

Development of next generation chip and a Wi-Fi product line expected to result in product revenue growth in 2017.     

Jeffrey Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented,  We are extremely pleased this quarter to show the initial results from our international licensing and enforcement program.  We believe this is the beginning of a successful program that will unlock significant value from our intellectual property portfolio.  The addition of the international enforcement prong to our program is proving to be a necessary and worthwhile endeavor, and we are pleased with the speed and efficiency of the German court system. Shortly after our hearing in Germany, the court found, as expected, that LG infringes our patent.  Upon successful resolution of the related nullity action, we anticipate the court will also provide the injunctive relief that we ve requested.          		 

Mr. Parker continued,  We have a dedicated team that continues to develop new intellectual property and products while maintaining a tight control on operating costs.  Our investment in developing an expertise in the wireless space enables us to soon introduce products that we believe will be attractive to a wide consumer audience in both price and features, and we look forward to unveiling these products in the near-term  .          		 

Third Quarter and Nine Months 2016 Financial Results 

Revenue of $4  .0   million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, was primarily driven by patent license and settlement   revenue  .     

Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2016, which excluded the effects of share-based compensation expense and changes in fair value of the contingent repayment obligation, was $0.2 million, reflecting a $2.75 million, or 94% improvement over the adjusted net loss of $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2015.  Non-GAAP net loss per common share was $0.01 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.30 for the same quarter in 2015.      

Operating expenses for the third quarter 2016 reflected a $0.6 million increase in litigation fees and expenses over the third quarter of 2015 as a result of costs related to the ITC and German patent infringement actions.  Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected a $3.9 million increase in litigation fees and expenses.  The Company s litigation fees and expenses incurred in 2016 have been paid from the $11 million in restricted funds received from Brickell Key Investments ( BKI ).       

Cash used in operations was approximately $11.8 million in the first nine months of 2016, of which $8.3 million was funded from restricted cash and cash equivalents for payment of legal fees and expenses.  This compares to $10.0 million of cash used in operations for the first nine months of 2015.        

Cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2016 included $13 million in financing received from BKI, of which $11 million was restricted for legal fees and expenses.  The Company repaid $3.3 million of this contingent payment obligation in the third quarter of 2016.       

At September 30, 2016, the Company has $2.7 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents representing the unused portion of the restricted funds received from BKI.  Unrestricted cash,   cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaled approximately $1.1 million at September 30, 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures that Supplement GAAP Measures 

We use both generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and non-GAAP financial measures for assessing our operating performance.  The non-GAAP measures we use include Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share.  These non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on net loss and net loss per share of (i) changes in fair value of our contingent payment obligation and (ii) share-based compensation expense.  We consider these non-GAAP measures to provide relevant supplemental information to assist investors in better understanding our operating results.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.   

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 follows:
