NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Founded in the United States
( US ) in 2001, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. ( Sino-Global  or the  Company ) is a non-asset
based global shipping and freight logistic integrated solution provider. The Company provides tailored solutions and value added
services to its customers to drive effectiveness and control in related links throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic
chain. The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S., China (including Hong Kong),
Australia and Canada. Currently, a significant portion of the Company s business is generated from the clients located in
the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ), and its operations are currently primarily conducted in the PRC. 

The Company s subsidiary
in China, Trans Pacific Shipping Limited ( Trans Pacific Beijing ), a wholly owned foreign enterprise, invested in
one 90%-owned subsidiary, Trans Pacific Logistics Shanghai Limited ( Trans Pacific Shanghai ). Trans Pacific Beijing
and Trans Pacific Shanghai are referred to collectively as  Trans Pacific . 

The Company s shipping
agency business was operated by its subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong). The Company s ship management services were
operated by its subsidiary in Hong Kong. The Company s shipping and chartering services were operated by its subsidiary in the
US and subsidiaries in Hong Kong. The Company s inland transportation management services are operated by its subsidiaries
in China and US. The Company s freight logistic services are operated by its subsidiaries in the US. 

In January 2016, the Company
formed a subsidiary, Sino-Global Shipping LA Inc. ( Sino LA ), for the purpose of expanding its business to provide
freight logistic services to importers who ship goods into the U.S. The Company expects to generate increased revenue from this
new service platform in the near future. 

In the fiscal year of 2016,
affected by the worsening market conditions in the shipping industry, the Company s shipping agency business segment suffered
a significant decrease due to a reduced number of ships served. Therefore, the Company has temporarily suspended its shipping agency
services business. Also, suffered by this market condition changes, the Company has temporarily suspended its ship management services.
In addition, in December 2015, the Company also temporarily suspended its shipping and chartering services business primarily as
a result of the termination of its previously contemplated vessel acquisition. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s current
service offerings consist of inland transportation management services and freight logistic services. 

In August 2016,
the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) authorized management to move forward with the development
of a mobile application that will provide a full-service logistics platform between the US and China for short-haul trucking
in the US. The decision follows an extensive review by the Company's management team and Board in identifying Sino-Global's
key competitive advantages as an expert in global logistics between the US and China, and then leveraging that experience to
both address the needs of its customer base and provide solutions to current issues affecting logistics and supply chain.
The Company completed a market analysis and feasibility study related to building a mobile based logistics application
for short-haul trucking in US ports to better manage the over 25 million containers, or TEU moving between China and the US
each year. 

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

(a) Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary to give a fair presentation have been included.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of a full year. The information in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with information included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with
the SEC on September 19, 2016. 

(b) Basis of Consolidation  

The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. ( Sino-China ) is considered
a variable interest entity ( VIE ), and the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company through Trans Pacific Beijing
entered into agreements with Sino-China, pursuant to which the Company receives 90% of Sino-China s net income. The Company
does not receive any payment from Sino-China unless Sino-China recognizes net income during its fiscal year. These agreements do
not entitle the Company to any consideration if Sino-China incurs a net loss during its fiscal year. If Sino-China incurs a net
loss during its fiscal year, the Company is not required to absorb such net loss. 

As a VIE, Sino-China s
revenues are included in the Company s total revenues, and its loss from operations is consolidated with that of the Company.
Because of the contractual arrangements, the Company had a pecuniary interest in Sino-China that requires consolidation of the
financial statements of the Company and Sino-China. 

The Company has consolidated
Sino-China s operating results because the entities are under common control in accordance with ASC 805-10,  Business
Combinations . The agency relationship between the Company and Sino-China and its branches is governed by a series of contractual
arrangements pursuant to which the Company has substantial control over Sino-China. Management makes ongoing reassessments of whether
the Company is the primary beneficiary of Sino-China. As mentioned elsewhere in this report, due to the worsening market conditions
in the shipping industry, Sino-China s shipping agency business suffered a significant decrease due to a reduced number of
ships served. Therefore, the Company has temporarily suspended this business. 

The carrying amount and
classification of Sino-China's assets and liabilities included in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets were as follows: 

(c) Use of Estimates and Assumptions  

The preparation of the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are adjusted
to reflect actual experience when necessary. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, fair value of stock based compensation, cost of revenues, allowance
for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and the useful lives of property and equipment. 

Since the use of estimates
is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(d) Revenue Recognition Policy   

Revenues from shipping agency services are recognized upon completion of services, which coincides with the date of departure of the relevant vessel from port. Advance payments and deposits received from customers prior to the provision of services and recognition of the related revenues are presented as advances from customers.   

Revenues from shipping and chartering services are recognized upon performance of services as stipulated in the underlying contracts.   

Revenues from inland transportation management services are recognized when commodities are being released from the customers  warehouse.   

Revenues from ship management services are recognized when the related contractual services are rendered.   

Revenues from freight logistic services are recognized when the related contractual services are rendered.   

(e) Translation of Foreign Currency  

The accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, including Sino-China and each of its branches are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the  functional currency ). The Company s functional currency is the US dollar
( USD ) while its subsidiaries in China, including Sino-China report its financial position and results of operations
in Renminbi ( RMB ). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into USD using fixed exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. Generally
foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognized in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations. The Company translates foreign currency financial statements of Sino-China, Sino-Global
Shipping Australia, Sino-Global Shipping Hong Kong, Sino-Global Shipping Canada, Trans Pacific Beijing and Trans Pacific Shanghai
in accordance with ASC 830-10,  Foreign Currency Matters . Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange
rates quoted by the People s Bank of China at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates in effect during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) and
accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity of the Company and also included in non-controlling interest. 

The exchange rates as of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash on hand, and other highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have maturities
of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions mainly
in the PRC, Australia, Hong Kong and the United States. As of September 30 and June 30, 2016, cash balances of $2,855,598 and
$1,333,713, respectively, were maintained at financial institutions in the PRC, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or other programs. 

(g) Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are
presented at net realizable value. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews
the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability
of individual receivable balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many
factors, including the age of the balances, customers  historical payment history, their current credit-worthiness and current
economic trends. Receivables are considered past due after 365 days. Accounts Receivable is written off against the allowance after
exhaustive efforts at collection. 

(h) Earnings (loss)
per Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to holders of common shares by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares. Common share equivalents are
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effects would be anti-dilutive. 

The effect of 66,000 stock
options and 139,032 warrants for all periods presented was not included in the calculation of diluted EPS because they would be
anti-dilutive. 

The effect of 150,000
stock options was not included in the calculation of diluted EPS because such options were anti-dilutive. 

(i) Stock-based Compensation  

Valuations are based upon
highly subjective assumptions about the future, including stock price volatility and exercise patterns. The fair value of share-based
payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility
of the Company s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations. The expected
term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for
periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. 

(j) Risks and Uncertainties  

The Company s business,
financial position and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as
well as by the general state of the PRC economy. The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations
and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated
with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may
be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental
policies or interpretations with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances
abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. Moreover, the Company s ability to grow its business and maintain
its profitability could be negatively affected by the nature and extent of services provided to its major customers, Tianjin Zhi
Yuan Investment Group Co., Ltd. (the  Zhiyuan Investment Group ) and Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. ( Tengda
Northwest ). 

(k) Reclassifications  

Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the results of
operations and cash flows. 

(l) Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  to address diversity in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on
the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon
Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest
Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement
of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life
Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions;
and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for public business
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities,
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied
using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively
for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

In October 2016, the FASB
has issued ASU No. 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The amendments
require an entity to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer
occurs and remove the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The amendments are effective
for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
within those annual reporting periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its financial statements and related
disclosures. 

In October 2016, the FASB
has issued ASU No. 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control ,
to provide guidance on the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by amending how a reporting
entity, that is a single decision maker of a VIE, treats indirect interests in that entity held through related parties that are
under common control. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its financial statements
and related disclosures. 

Note 3. ADVANCES TO SUPPLIERS  

The Company s advances
to suppliers are as follows: 

(a) On June 10, 2016, the
Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) with Singapore Metals   Minerals Pte Ltd. (the  Buyer )
and Galasi Jernsih Sdn BHD (the  Seller ), whereby the Buyer will be the bauxite purchaser for the 3,000,000 MT/year,
subject to the results of the tests satisfying the Buyer s requirements. Both the Buyer and the Seller agree that the Company
shall be appointed as general agent to handle logistics and transportation including ocean shipping and inland transportation for
both sides, and all door to door transportation services for the shipping of the bauxite to be sold by the Seller and to be purchased
by the Buyer as referenced in this MOU. On the same day, the Company signed a supplementary agreement with the Buyer, which states
the Company should assist the Buyer in handling transportation service from the source mine to dock to help the Buyer to fulfill
the delivery favorably and close the deal smoothly. The Company agrees to make advance payments for freight charges on behalf of
the Buyer. As of September 30, 2016, the ending balance of this prepayment was $3,610,846. The Company expects the related advance
payments will be recognized as cost of sales during the next 12 months. 

Note 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  

The Company s net
accounts receivable are as follows: 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, recovery of doubtful accounts receivable was $109,693, because the Company fully collected the balance from
Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, recovery of doubtful accounts receivable was
$14,415. 

Note 5. OTHER RECEIVABLES  

Other receivables represent
mainly prepaid employee insurance and welfare benefits, which will be subsequently deducted from the employee payroll, guarantee
deposits on behalf of ship owners as well as office lease deposits with the landlords. 

Note 6. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT
ASSETS  

The Company s prepaid
expenses and other current assets are as follows: 

(1): The Company entered
into management consulting and advisory services agreements with two consultants on June 6, 2014, pursuant to which the consultants
should assist the Company in, among other things, financial and tax due diligence, business evaluation and integration, and development
of pro forma financial statements. In return for their services, as approved by the Company s Board of Directors, a total
of 600,000 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to these two consultants. Their service agreements are for the
period from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. 

In addition, on May 5, 2015,
the Company entered into management consulting and advisory services agreements with three consultants, pursuant to which the consultants
should assist the Company in, among other things, review of time charter agreements; crew management advisory; development of permanent
and preventive maintenance standards related to dry dockings and ship repairs; development of regular technical and marine vessel
inspections and quality control procedures; and development and implementation of alternative remedial actions to address any technical
problems that may arise. In return for their services, as approved by the Company s Board of Directors, a total of 500,000
shares of the Company s common stock were to be issued to these three consultants. Their service agreements are for a period
of 18 months, effective May 2015. The value of their consulting services was determined using the fair value of the Company s
common stock of $1.50 per share when the shares were issued to the consultants.

Legal proceedings   

During the quarter ended
December 31, 2015, a former Vice President of the Company, Mr. Alexander   Chen, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department
of Labor-Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) against the Company and three current or former executives.
Mr. Chen is seeking $350,000 plus attorney s fees for the alleged retaliation and a purported breach of his employment agreement.
The Company has responded to the complaint filed with OSHA, providing argument and information supporting the Company s position
that no violation of law in connection with Chen s employment. As of the date of this report, the Company offered to settle
the complaint by $90,000 and has accrued $90,000 as the Company s liability, which was expensed directly in the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Contingency   

The Labor Contract Law
of the PRC requires employers to insure the liability of the severance payments if employees are terminated and have been working
for the employers for at least two years prior to January 1, 2008. The employers will be liable for one month for severance pay
for each year of the service provided by the employees. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company has estimated its
severance payments of approximately $61,000 and $62,500, respectively, which has not been reflected in its consolidated financial
statements, because management cannot predict what the actual payment, if any, will be in the future. 

Note 12. INCOME TAXES  

The income tax expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

The Company s deferred
tax assets are comprised of the following: 

The Company s operations
in the U.S. have incurred a cumulative net operating loss of approximately $7,966,000 and $8,629,000, respectively, as of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, which may reduce future taxable income. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the amount
of utilization of Federal Net Operating Losses ( NOL ) is $400,144 and the tax benefit derived from such NOL is $136,000,
in the corresponding period for the three months ended September 30, 2015 the utilization of NOL is nil and no tax benefit derived
from NOL. This carry-forward will expire if not utilized by 2036. 

The Company periodically
evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets
by a valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing
the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation
of future income, the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Part of the Company s
traditional business, such as shipping agency services and shipping   chartering services, is temporarily suspended. In addition,
the Company s new business of mobile application is still in developing stage. Management concluded that the profitability
of the Company s U.S. entities is difficult to be predicted, and accordingly a 100% valuation allowance has been provided
against the deferred tax assets balance as of September 30, 2016 based on management s estimate. The net decrease in the
valuation allowance for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $174,000 and the net increase in the valuation allowance
for the same period of 2015 was $171,000, respectively. 

The Company s taxes
payable consists of the following:

Note 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

In June 2013, the Company
signed a five-year global logistic service agreement with TianJin Zhi Yuan Investment Group Co., Ltd. (the  Zhiyuan Investment
Group ) and TEWOO Chemical   Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd. (together with Zhiyuan Investment Group,  Zhiyuan ).
Zhiyuan Investment Group is owned by Mr. Zhang, the largest shareholder of the Company. In September 2013, the Company executed
an inland transportation management service contract with the Zhiyuan Investment Group whereby it would provide certain advisory
services and help control its potential commodities loss during the transportation process. As a result of the inland transportation
management services provided to Zhiyuan, the Company generated revenue of $857,635 (44% of the Company s total revenue) and
$753,597 (28% of the Company s total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount
due from Zhiyuan Investment Group at June 30, 2016 was $1,622,519. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
continued to provide inland transportation management services to Zhiyuan and also collected approximately $1.4 million from Zhiyuan
to reduce the outstanding accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2016, the amount due from Zhiyuan was $1,117,695. Management
expects the receivable will be substantially collected in the second half of fiscal year 2017. 

Item 2.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following discussion and analysis
of our company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  

Overview  

Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. ( Sino ),
a Virginia corporation, was founded in 2001. Sino is a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistic integrated solution
provider. Sino provides tailored solutions and value added services to its customers to drive effectiveness and control in related
aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. Our current service offerings consist of inland transportation
management services and freight logistic services. We temporarily suspended our shipping agency and ship management services primarily
due to market condition changes. We also temporarily suspended our shipping and chartering services primarily as a result of the
termination of the vessel acquisition in December 2015. 

Company Structure  

The Company conducts its business primarily
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong), Australia, Canada, and U.S. (New York and Los Angeles). 

Currently, the Company s inland transportation
management services are operated by its subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong) and the US. The freight logistic services
are operated by the Company s subsidiaries in New York and Los Angeles. 

Fiscal Year 2017 Trends  

China s economy is declining
due to the growing foreign debt, declining factory activities and devaluation in foreign exchange reserves, which has
prolonged negative impact on the shipping industry. Although we expect China s economy will have a soft landing, the
difficult macroeconomic conditions in fiscal year 2016 will likely continue into fiscal year 2017. On the other hand, recent
US economic data paints a picture of an economy in strong recovery mode and  consumer
spending is likely to receive a positive bounce from low energy prices . The economy outlook has led us to believe we
must continue to diversify our service platform; reduce our dependency on businesses generated from China; and promote
US-based complementary shipping logistics services to create a new driver to stimulate the development for our business.
Furthermore, in the age of  Internet Plus , we believe information and communication technologies can be adopted
to traditional industries to meet the current challenges of supply and demand. We will continue to foster strong
relationships with our strategic partners and draw upon our technical ability and in-depth industry knowledge to develop
innovative value-added logistic solutions for our customers in the fiscal year of 2017. 

4   

In July 2016, the Company signed a
Strategic Cooperation Agreement (the  Agreement ) with COSCO Logistics (Americas) Inc. ( COSCO
Logistics ), which belongs to China's largest integrated shipping company, China COSCO Holdings Company Ltd. Pursuant to
the Agreement, both parties will mutually provide logistics services between China and the US and develop shipping customers
as an end-to-end global logistics service. The Company expects to work with COSCO Logistics to provide inland transportation
services in the US for shipments to and from China. According to the Agreement, the two companies will also assess locations
in the US to potentially establish warehouse and/or distribution facilities in the coming months and share pricing information for
short-haul trucking services across selected regions of the country. 

In August 2016, the Company
announced the development of an internet-based application that will provide a full-service logistics platform between the US
and China to short-haul trucking companies in the US. The decision follows an extensive review by the Company's management
team and the Board in identifying Sino s key competitive advantages as an expert in global logistics between the US and
China, and then leveraging that experience to both address the needs of its customer base and provide solutions to current
issues affecting logistics and supply chain. After speaking with few potential and existing customers, our
internet-based application expect to be launch by the end of 2016, and the management team believes this will move the
Company to a new stage. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues  . Total revenues decreased by $754,816
or 28.0% from $2,699,218 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,944,402 for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease
was mainly due to the declined revenues generated from our shipping agency services segment due to the decreased number of ships
served. In addition, due to termination of the vessel acquisition, revenue from our shipping and chartering services segment decreased
to nil. 

The following table presents summary information by segment
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Revenues  

(1) Revenues from Shipping Agency and Ship Management
Services   

l      Shipping Agency Services      

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our
revenue generated from the shipping agency segment was nil and $1,059,385, respectively. The Company has mentioned on its annual
report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the management team decided to temporarily suspend the shipping agency services
as the shipping industry is during downturn. The decline in revenues was mainly due to the decrease in the total number of ships
the Company served from 10 ships for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 0 ship for the three months ended September 30,
2016. The decrease in the number of ships served for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was largely due to the general economy
slow-down, the rising labor costs in China and intense competition in the industry, with established and new competitors offering
rates that in many cases are lower than we can offer. On the other hand, the rising labor costs and increased overhead costs also
reduced our profitability in this business line. However, we will provide the shipping agency services once the shipping industry
turns positive. 

5   

l      Ship Management Services      

We did not generate any revenue from the ship management service
segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In connection with our acquisition of Longhe Ship Management (Hong
Kong) Co. Limited in 2014, we launched ship management services in 2014 but considering the market conditions, risk control and
the future development of ship management services, and our costs and profitability of this business segment, the management decided
to temporarily suspend the ship management business from the beginning of fiscal year 2016. 

(2) Revenues from Shipping and Chartering Services   

In connection with the termination of the acquisition of Rong
Yao International Shipping Limited ( Rong Yao ) on December 7, 2015, the Company realigned its developing strategy
and temporarily suspended the shipping and chartering services. As a result, we reported nil and $446,218 revenue from this segment
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      

(3) Revenues from Inland Transportation Management Services   

In September 2013, the Company executed an inland transportation
management service contract with Zhiyuan Investment Group whereby the Company provides certain solutions to help it control potential
commodities loss during the transportation process. The Company started to provide inland transportation management services to
a third-party customer, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. ( Tengda Northwest ), following the quarter ended September
2014. As a result, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the inland transportation management services generated
revenues of $1,485,735 and $1,193,615, respectively, and gross profit of $1,381,734 and $1,005,062, respectively. The increase
of revenue from this segment is due to the increase in commodities transported by Zhiyuan Investment Group and Tengda Northwest. 

(4) Revenues from Freight Logistic Services   

Since the Company formed new subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping
LA Inc. in January 2016, we started to provide freight logistic services, which include cargo forwarding and truck transportation
services. During this quarter, the portion of revenue generated by freight logistic service has largely increased, hence the Company
discloses the related revenue as a separate business segment. The Company has signed an agreement with LJC Trading New York Ltd.,
and Zhiyuan (Hongkong) Chromium Group Co., to provide freight logistic services. The management expects this business segment will
bring a positive outcome for the Company. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the revenue generated from freight logistic
services was $458,667, and the related gross profit was $256,329. 

Operating Costs and Expenses  

Total Operating Costs and Expenses  . Total operating
costs and expenses decreased by $954,579 or 43.7% from $2,186,141 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,231,562 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues and general and
administrative expenses, partially offset by the increase in selling expenses, as discussed below. 

The following tables set forth the components of the Company s
costs and expenses for the periods indicated. 

6   

Costs of Revenues   

The cost of revenue was $306,339 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $934,337 or 75.3% as compared to $1,240,676 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The overall cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues decreased from 46.0% for the three months ended September
30, 2015 to 15.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in the overall cost of revenue in percentage term
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly because the majority of our revenue during the three months ended September
30, 2016 came from more profitable inland transportation business lines and freight logistic service with higher gross profit margin
rather than from less profitable shipping agency service segment. As the revenue from shipping agency services has been decreased
to nil, the inland transportation management service and freight logistic service were considered as our essential revenue sources. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries and benefits, office rent, office expenses, regulatory filing and listing fees, amortization of stock-based compensation
expenses, legal, accounting and other professional service fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had $859,914
of general and administrative expenses as compared to $930,842 for the three months ended September 30,  2015, a decrease of
$70,928 or 7.6%. The decline was mainly due to effective cost control procedures in effect and also a recovery of allowance for
doubtful accounts, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expenses. As a percentage of revenue, our general and
administrative expenses increased from 34.5% to 44.2% of the revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
This increase was largely due to our reduced revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
of 2015. 

Selling Expenses   

The selling expenses consist primarily of business development
costs and commissions for our operating staff to the ports at which we provide services. For the three months ended September 30,
2016, we had $65,309 of selling expenses as compared to $14,623 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $50,686
or 346.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our selling expenses increased from 0.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to
3.4% for the corresponding quarter in 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made more efforts on business
development to explore new business opportunities while maintaining our current customer relationship. As mentioned above,
the Company formed a new subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping LA Inc. in January 2016 and started to provide freight logistic services,
which led to increased selling expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016. On the other hand, the rising labor costs
also increased our overall selling expense as compared to the same period of 2015. 

Operating Income .  The Company had an operating
income of $712,840 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating income of $513,077 for the comparable
period ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due mainly to increased revenue generated from the inland transportation management
services and freight logistic services with strong margin contribution, and the declined general and administrative expenses as
discussed above. 

Financial Expense, Net .  The Company s
net financial expense was $3,434 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net financial expense of $117,207 for
the same period of 2015. We have operations in the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and China. Our financial expense for each reporting
period mainly reflected the effect of depreciation/appreciation of foreign currencies in terms of USD. 

Taxation .  The income tax expense was $71,621
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to income tax expense of $240,822 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense was due mainly to decreased taxable income of Trans Pacific. 

Net Income .  As a result of the foregoing,
the Company had net income of $637,785 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $155,048 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. After deduction of non-controlling interest, net income attributable to Sino-Global was
$645,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $184,158 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. With comprehensive income (loss) from foreign currency translation, comprehensive income attributable to the Company
was $620,606 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to comprehensive income of $92,944 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows and Working Capital   

As of September 30, 2016, we had $2,896,265 in cash and cash
equivalents. We had approximately 1.1% of our cash in banks located in New York, Los Angeles, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong and
had approximately 98.9% of cash in banks located in China. 

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for
the periods indicated: 

The following table sets forth a summary of our working capital: 

We finance our ongoing operating activities primarily by using
funds from our operations. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements to evaluate the use of available
funding sources. In assessing its liquidity, management monitors and analyzes the Company s cash on-hand, its ability
to generate sufficient revenue source in the future and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company plans to
fund continuing operations through identifying new prospective joint venture and strategic alliance opportunities for new revenue
sources, and reducing costs to improve profitability and replenish working capital. Considering our existing working capital position
and our ability to access other funding sources, management believes that the foregoing measures collectively will provide sufficient
liquidity for the Company to meet its future liquidity and capital obligations. 

Operating Activities   

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,524,374 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included our operating income of $0.64 million due to increased revenue generated
from inland transportation management services and freight logistic services with strong margin contribution, and the declined
general and administrative expenses. In addition, the accounts receivable decreased by $1.66 million because we strengthened our
cash collection efforts and received payment of $1.8 million from Tengda Northwest, our major third-party customer of inland transportation
management services, and due from related parties decreased by $0.5 million because we collected $1.4 million from our related
party customer, Zhiyuan. However, the advances to suppliers increased by $1.42 million because we prepaid freight fees of RMB 20.18
million (USD$3.0 million) based on our Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore Metals   Minerals Pte Ltd. and Galasi Jernsih
Sdn BHD (See Note 3). The Company s cash inflows from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016
reflected the above mentioned factors. 

Net cash used in operating activities was $263,883 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, which included our net income of $0.16 million and an increase in tax payable of $321,313, offset
by a decrease in accounts payable of $352,263 and an increase in due from related parties of $485,876. Our cash outflows from the
operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflected the above factors.

Investing Activities   

Net cash used in investing activities was nil for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $927 for the same period of 2015, respectively.
$927 was spent on the property and equipment purchase during the three months ended September 30, 2015 while there were no investing
activities during the same period this year. 

Financing Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities was nil for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 while it was $632,264 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to the net proceeds from
our issuance of 500,000 shares of restricted shares to Mr. Weixiong Yang in a private sale transaction on July 10, 2015. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We prepare the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
in accordance with US GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions on the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal period, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each
fiscal period. We continually evaluate these judgments and estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment
of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable. 

There have been no other material changes
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in our significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the Company s
annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

The selection of critical accounting policies,
the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes
in conditions and assumptions are factors that should be considered when reviewing our financial statements. We believe the following
accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition   

Revenues from shipping agency services are recognized upon completion of services, which coincides with the date of departure of the relevant vessel from port. Advance payments and deposits received from customers prior to the provision of services and recognition of the related revenues are presented as advances from customers.   

Revenues from shipping and chartering services are recognized upon performance of services as stipulated in the underlying contracts.   

Revenues from inland transportation management services are recognized when commodities are being released from the customers  warehouse.   

Revenues from ship management services are recognized when the related contractual services are rendered.   

Revenues from freight logistic services are recognized when the related contractual services are rendered.   

Basis of Consolidation   

The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the parent and its subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated
in consolidation. Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. ( Sino-China ) is considered to be a Variable Interest Entity (VIE)
and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Because of the contractual arrangements, the Company had a pecuniary interest in Sino-China
that requires consolidation of our and Sino-China s financial statements. The accounts of Sino-China are consolidated in
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC )
810-10,  Consolidation . As a VIE, Sino-China s revenues are included in our total revenues, its net loss from
operations is consolidated with our net income (loss) before non-controlling interest. Our non-controlling interest in its net
loss is then subtracted in calculating the net income attributable to the Company. The Company temporarily suspended its business
with Sino-China in June 2014, therefore, there is no net income generated by Sino-China in the present. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions   

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are adjusted to reflect actual experience when necessary.
Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include
revenue recognition, fair value of stock based compensation, cost of revenues, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred income
taxes, and the useful lives of property and equipment. 

Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial
reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

9   

Accounts Receivable   

Accounts receivable are recognized at net realizable value.
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required
payments in the relevant time period. Management reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and record general and specific
allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual
receivable balances, we consider many factors, including the age of the balance, the customer s historical payment history,
its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Receivables are considered past due after 365 days. Accounts are written
off against the allowance only after exhaustive collection efforts. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements  

We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments
to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to
our shares and classified as shareholders  equity or that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as
credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services
with us.  

Item 3.   
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    

This Item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company maintains controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing evaluation, Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) were effective and adequately designed to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information was accumulated and
communicated to the management, including Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allowed
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.  

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
