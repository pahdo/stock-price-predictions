   1.  Nature of Operations   
     
  Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in February 1990. Except where otherwise noted, the words  we,   us,   our  and similar terms, as well as  Company,  refer to Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. We are a developer, owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in markets throughout the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries own or operate fourteen casino gaming facilities in the United States located in Black Hawk, Colorado; Pompano Beach, Florida; Bettendorf, Marquette and Waterloo, Iowa; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Lula and Vicksburg, Mississippi; Boonville, Cape Girardeau, Caruthersville and Kansas City, Missouri; and Nemacolin, Pennsylvania.  
     
   Proposed Transaction with Eldorado Resorts, Inc.   
     
  On September 19, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Eldorado Resorts, Inc. ( Eldorado  or  ERI ) will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. ( Isle ) for $23.00 in cash or 1.638 shares of Eldorado common stock, at the election of each Isle shareholder, reflecting total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Eldorado and Isle shareholders will hold approximately 62% and 38%, respectively, of the combined company s outstanding shares. As a result of the merger, Isle will cease to be a publicly traded company.  
     
  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Eldorado and Isle. The transaction is subject to approval of the stockholders of Eldorado and Isle, the approval of applicable gaming authorities and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be consummated in the second calendar quarter of 2017.  
     
  Other than transaction expenses associated with the merger of $3,413 for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, the terms of the agreement did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
   2.  Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. In management s opinion, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results presented. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 24, 2016 as filed with the SEC and all of our other filings, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC after such date and through the date of this report, which are available on the SEC s website at  www.sec.gov  or our website at  www.islecorp.com .  
     
  Our fiscal year ends typically on the last Sunday in April. Periodically, this system necessitates a 53-week year.  Fiscal 2017 and 2016 are both 52-week years, which commenced on April 25, 2016 and April 27, 2015, respectively.  
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. We view each  
     
 6   

property as an operating segment and all such operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment.  
     
   3.  New Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  As part of the ongoing convergence of GAAP and the International Accounting Standards Board s current standards on revenue recognition, the Financial Account Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which provides companies with a single model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. To further clarify certain aspects of the revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedient  and ASU No. 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  in May 2016, ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  in April 2016 and ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  in March 2016. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date , deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted only for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Update No. 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest.  This update requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The standard was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard requires application of the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 for all periods presented. This reclassification reduced our total assets and total liabilities as previously reported in our consolidated balance sheet for April 24, 2016 by $10.9 million. This reclassification had no effect on our retained earnings or net income previously reported.  
     
  In August 2015, the FASB issued Update No. 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which further clarifies the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. This update allows for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to be presented as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2015, for interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and elected to present debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility as an asset with subsequent amortization.  
     
   4.  Discontinued Operations   
     
  On August 22, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our casino and hotel property in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for $134,500, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment, to an affiliate of Laguna Development Corporation, a Pueblo of Laguna-owned business based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The transaction is expected to be completed in late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018, subject to Louisiana Gaming Board approval and other customary closing conditions. We received a $20,000 deposit related to this transaction, which is reflected in restricted cash within current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 23, 2016.  
     
  On October 13, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our casino in Marquette, Iowa, for $40,000, subject to a customary working capital adjustment, to an affiliate of Casino Queen, based in Swansea, Illinois. As a result, we recorded a non-cash pretax valuation charge of $834 to reduce the carrying value of Marquette s net assets held for sale to the expected net realizable value upon completion of the sale transaction. The transaction is  
     
 7   

expected to be completed in early fiscal 2018, subject to the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Illinois Gaming Control Board and other customary closing conditions. We received a $2,000 deposit related to this transaction, which is reflected in restricted cash within current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 23, 2016.  
     
  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Lake Charles and Marquette met the requirements for presentation as assets held for sale and discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the operations of Lake Charles and Marquette have been classified as discontinued operations and as assets held for sale for all periods presented.  
     
  On October 19, 2015, we closed our casino property in Natchez, Mississippi, and completed the previously announced sale of the hotel and certain related non-gaming assets to Casino Holding Investment Partners, LLC for net cash proceeds of $11,448.  As a result, we recorded a net gain of $2,000 in discontinued operations for the  six months ended October 25, 2015. The net gain consisted of a gain on the sale of the hotel and related non-gaming assets of $6,424, offset by a non-cash pretax charge of $4,424 related to the write-off of the Natchez gaming vessel and certain other assets. The operations of our Natchez property have been classified as discontinued for all periods presented. 
     
  The Company incurred $2,121 and $3,179 for capital expenditures at our Lake Charles and Marquette properties during the six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015, respectively, and incurred $307 for capital expenditures at our Natchez property during the six months ended October 25, 2015.  
     
  The results of our discontinued operations are summarized as follows:  

8   

The assets and liabilities held for sale were as follows:  

5.  Long-Term Debt   
     
  Long-term debt consists of the following:  

Senior Secured  Credit Facility   Our Senior Secured Credit Facility as amended and restated ( Credit Facility ) consists of a $300,000 revolving line of credit. The Credit Facility is secured on a first priority basis by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by substantially all of our significant subsidiaries. 
     
  Our net revolving line of credit availability at October 23, 2016, as limited by our outstanding borrowings, was approximately $249,400, after consideration of approximately $8,300 in outstanding letters of credit. We have an annual commitment fee related to the unused portion of the Credit Facility of up to 0.55%, which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The weighted average effective interest rates of the Credit Facility for the six months ended October 23, 2016 was 2.84%.  
     
 9   

The Credit Facility includes a number of affirmative and negative covenants. Additionally, we must comply with certain financial covenants including maintenance of a total leverage ratio, senior secured leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also restricts our ability to make certain investments or distributions. We were in compliance with the covenants as of October 23, 2016.  
     
  On November 14, 2016, we amended the Credit Facility to modify the maximum amount of proceeds allowable for asset sales to exclude the sale of our Lake Charles property.  
     
   5.875% Senior Notes   In March 2013, we issued $350,000 of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 5.875% Senior Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay term loans under our Credit Facility. On April 14, 2015, we issued an additional $150,000 of 5.875% Senior Notes at a price of 102.0%, which have the same terms and are treated as the same class as the outstanding 5.875% Senior Notes (the  April 2015 issuance ). After deducting the underwriting fees, the net proceeds of $151,500 from the April 2015 issuance were used to purchase a portion of our previously outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes validly tendered pursuant to a cash tender offer for any and all of our outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes (the  Tender Offer ). As a result of these issuances, we capitalized deferred financing costs of $217 in the six months ended October 25, 2015. 
     
  The 5.875% Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank junior to all of our senior secured indebtedness and senior to our senior subordinated indebtedness. The 5.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option as of March 15, 2016, with call premiums as defined in the indenture governing the 5.875% Senior Notes.  
     
   8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes     In August 2012, we issued $350,000 of 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 ( 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes ).  The 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank junior to all of our senior indebtedness. The 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes became redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option on June 15, 2016, with call premiums as defined in the indenture governing the 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes. 
     
  The 5.875% Senior Notes and 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by substantially all of our significant subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries as described in Note 11. All of the guarantor subsidiaries are wholly owned by us.  
     
  The indentures governing the 5.875% Senior Notes and 8.875% Senior Subordinated Notes limit, among other things, our ability and our restricted subsidiaries  ability to borrow money, make restricted payments, use assets as security in other transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, or repurchase stock. The indentures also limit our ability to issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries, sell assets in excess of specified amounts or merge with or into other companies.  
     
   Extinguishment of 7.75% Senior Notes   In March 2011, we issued $300,000 of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 at a price of 99.264% ( 7.75% Senior Notes ).  On April 13, 2015, we accepted for purchase $237,832 of the outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes validly tendered pursuant to a tender offer and we funded the payments utilizing the net proceeds from the 5.875% Senior Notes April 2015 issuance, additional borrowings under our Credit Facility and cash on hand. On April 14, 2015, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption of the remaining $62,168 of outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes at a redemption price of 103.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest at the redemption date in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 7.75% Senior Notes.  On May 14, 2015, we completed the redemption for approximately $65,000, utilizing additional borrowings under our Credit Facility and cash on hand. As a result of the completed redemption, we incurred expenses related to the write-off of the remaining deferred financing costs and the discount, redemption fees and other related costs of $2,966, recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended October 25, 2015. 
     
   6.  Earnings Per Share   
     
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share:  
     
 10   

Our basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock options with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of our common stock during the periods representing 356,195 and 65,460 shares, which were anti-dilutive, were excluded from the calculation of common shares for diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015, respectively.  
     
   7.  Stock Based Compensation   
     
  Under our 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, we have issued restricted stock units, performance stock units, restricted stock and stock options.  
     
   Restricted Stock Units   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we granted 145,516 restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to employees with a weighted average fair market value of $15.16 per unit on the date of grant. The RSUs are awarded to employees under annual long-term incentive grants which will vest and be converted to stock ratably over three years commencing on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.  Our aggregate estimate of forfeitures for restricted stock units is 10.7%. As of October 23, 2016, our unrecognized compensation cost for these RSUs was $1,756. 
     
  During fiscal 2013, we granted RSUs containing market performance conditions which determined the number of RSUs awarded. The market condition period ended April 26, 2015 and a gross award of 1,532,417 shares was achieved. Per the terms of the award agreement, the awards were issued net of shares necessary to pay minimum withholding taxes with 50% of the RSUs vesting on April 26, 2015 and the remainder vesting on April 26, 2016.  The fair value of these RSUs was initially determined utilizing a lattice pricing model which considered a range  
     
 11   

of assumptions including volatility and risk-free interest rates. On April 26, 2016, 467,073 shares, net of shares to pay minimum withholding taxes, were issued for the vested second RSU tranche.  
     
   Performance Stock Units   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we granted performance stock units ( PSUs ) to employees with a company performance condition that will determine the number of shares to ultimately vest, if any, up to 216,699 shares.  Any shares earned will vest at the end of three years from the date of grant.  The probability of meeting the performance condition will be assessed on a regular basis and compensation cost will be adjusted accordingly. Our aggregate estimate of forfeitures for performance stock units for employees is 17.7%. As of October 23, 2016, our unrecognized compensation cost for these PSUs is $2,781, based on current probability assumptions. 
     
   Restricted Stock   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we issued 32,239 shares of restricted stock to directors with a grant-date fair value of $21.60. Restricted stock awarded under annual long-term incentive grants to employees primarily vests one-third on each anniversary of the grant date and grants to directors vest one-half on the grant date and one-half on the first anniversary of the grant date. Our aggregate estimate of forfeitures for restricted stock for employees and directors is 10.0% and 0%, respectively. As of October 23, 2016, our unrecognized compensation cost for unvested restricted stock was $795 with a remaining weighted average vesting period of 1.0 years. 
     
   Stock Options   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we issued 310,735 non-qualified stock options, which have a maximum term of seven years and are exercisable in yearly installments of 20% commencing one year after the grant date. The options have a per share grant date fair value of $5.968 utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the range of assumptions disclosed in the following table: 

Weighted average volatility is calculated using the historical volatility of our stock price over a range of dates equal to the expected term of the grant s options. The weighted average expected term is calculated using historical data that is representative of the option for which the fair value is to be determined. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The weighted average risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the approximate period of time equivalent to the grant s expected term.  As of October 23, 2016, our aggregate forfeiture rate is 14.5% and our unrecognized compensation cost for unvested options was $1,999.  
     
   8.  Fair Value   
     
   Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   The following table sets forth the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by input level, in the consolidated balance sheets at October 23, 2016 and April 24, 2016: 
     
 12   

Marketable securities   The estimated fair values of our marketable securities are determined on an individual asset basis based upon quoted prices of identical assets available in active markets (Level 1), quoted prices of identical assets in inactive markets, or quoted prices for similar assets in active and inactive markets (Level 2), and represent the amounts we would expect to receive if we sold these marketable securities. 
     
   Restricted cash and investments   The estimated fair values of our restricted cash and investments are based upon quoted prices available in active markets (Level 1), or quoted prices for similar assets in active and inactive markets (Level 2), and represent the amounts we would expect to receive if we sold our restricted cash and investments. 
     
   Other Financial Instruments -   The estimated carrying amounts and fair values of our other financial instruments are as follows: 

The fair value of our long-term debt or other long-term obligations is estimated based on the quoted market price of the underlying debt issue (Level 1) or, when a quoted market price is not available, the discounted cash flow of future payments utilizing current rates available to us for debt of similar remaining maturities (Level 3). Debt obligations with a short remaining maturity have a carrying amount that approximates fair value.  
     
   9.  Income Taxes   
     
  Our effective tax rate ( ETR ) from continuing operations for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016 was (384.75%) and (117.2%), as compared to an ETR of 13.25% and 13.37% for the three and six months ended October 25, 2015.  Our ETR is based on statutory rates applied to our pretax book income, adjusted for permanent differences and other items, including partial release of valuation allowances due to current year pretax book income and changes in status of certain indefinite lived intangible assets.  
     
  As of October 23, 2016, we had a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets other than those related to the state deferred tax assets at our Florida casino.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards. Due to the Company s history of losses, valuation allowances have been established except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of taxable temporary differences, other than the indefinite lived intangibles.  
     
 13   

The assets and liabilities of Lake Charles and Marquette were classified as held for sale as of October 23, 2016 (see Note 4).  The deferred tax liability associated with the goodwill and intangible assets of these two entities, previously treated as indefinite lived, now have a finite life.  The expected reversal of this deferred tax liability associated with this goodwill and intangible assets have resulted in the release of $19,552 of valuation allowances previously recognized in prior years.  We expect that the estimated tax gain on these probable transactions, combined with the current year estimated income, are expected to offset our remaining federal net operating losses and credits and result in the release of the remaining related valuation allowance.  
     
   10.  Supplemental Disclosures   
     
   Cash Flow     For the six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015, we made net cash interest payments of $31,712 and $33,208, respectively. Additionally, we made net income tax payments of $125 and $130 during the six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015, respectively. 
     
  The change in accrued purchases of property and equipment in accounts payable was a decrease of $6,069 and an increase of $4,739, for the six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015, respectively.  
     
  During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we capitalized interest of $247, primarily related to our land-based casino construction at our Bettendorf property, which was completed on June 24, 2016. During the six months ended October 25, 2015, we capitalized interest of $212, primarily related to hotel renovations and land-based casino construction at our Bettendorf property.

12.  Commitments and Contingencies   
     
  We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental protection, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally, and are subject to cleanup requirements at certain of our facilities as a result thereof. We have not made, and do not anticipate making material expenditures, nor do we anticipate incurring delays with respect to environmental remediation or protection. However, in part because our present and future development sites have, in some cases, been used as manufacturing facilities or other facilities that generate materials that are required to be remediated under environmental laws and regulations, there can be no guarantee that additional pre-existing conditions will not be discovered and we will not experience material liabilities or delays.  
     
  We are subject to various contingencies and litigation matters and have a number of unresolved claims. Although the ultimate liability of these contingencies, this litigation and these claims cannot be determined at this time, we believe they will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   Executive Overview   
     
  We are a developer, owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related dining, lodging and entertainment facilities in regional markets in the United States. We have sought and established geographic diversity to limit the risks caused by weather, regional economic difficulties, gaming tax rates and regulations of local gaming authorities. We currently operate casinos in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Pennsylvania.  
     
  Our operating results for the periods presented have been affected, both positively and negatively, by current economic conditions and several other factors discussed in detail below. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of these factors and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 24, 2016 and by giving consideration to the following:  
     
   Items Impacting Income from Continuing Operations   
     
   Pending Merger   On September 19, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Eldorado Resorts, Inc. ( Eldorado,  or  ERI ) will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. ( Isle ) for $23.00 in cash or 1.638 shares of Eldorado common stock, at the election of each Isle shareholder, reflecting total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Eldorado and Isle shareholders will hold approximately 62% and 38%, respectively, of the combined company s outstanding shares. As a result of the merger, Isle will cease to be a publicly traded company. 
     
  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Eldorado and Isle. The transaction is subject to approval of the stockholders of Eldorado and Isle, the approval of applicable gaming  
     
 22   

authorities and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be consummated in the second calendar quarter of 2017.  
     
  Other than transaction expenses associated with the merger of $3.4 million for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, the terms of the agreement did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Debt Refinancing   In May 2015, we redeemed the remaining $62.0 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes and incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.0 million in the six months ended October 25, 2015. 
     
   Hurricane Matthew   On October 6, 2016, our property in Pompano Beach, Florida was closed for 24 hours due to Hurricane Matthew. 
     
   Income Tax Benefit   During the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, we released a valuation allowance of $19.6 million as a result of the change in status of the indefinite lived intangible assets associated with our Lake Charles and Marquette properties. 
     
   Discontinued Operations    On August 22, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our casino and hotel property in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for $134.5 million, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment, to an affiliate of Laguna Development Corporation, a Pueblo of Laguna-owned business based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The transaction is expected to be completed in late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018, subject to Louisiana Gaming Board approval and other customary closing conditions. 
     
  On October 23, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our casino in Marquette, Iowa, for $40.0 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment, to an affiliate of Casino Queen, based in Swansea, Illinois. The transaction is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2018, subject to the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Illinois Gaming Control Board and other customary closing conditions.  
     
  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Lake Charles and Marquette met the requirements for presentation as assets held for sale and discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the operations of Lake Charles and Marquette have been classified as discontinued operations and as assets held for sale for all period presented.  
     
  On October 19, 2015, we closed our casino property in Natchez, Mississippi and completed the previously announced sale of the hotel and certain related non-gaming assets to Casino Holding Investment Partners, LLC for net cash proceeds of $11.4 million.  As a result of our decision to separately sell the Natchez gaming vessel and certain other assets, we determined that the carrying value of the assets were greater than their net realizable value and recorded a non-cash pretax charge of $4.4 million during the six months ended October 25, 2015. Subsequently, we recorded a net gain of $2.0 million in discontinued operations during fiscal 2016. The net gain consisted of a gain on the sale of the hotel and related non-gaming assets of $6.4 million, offset by the non-cash pretax charge of $4.4 million. The operations of our Natchez property have been classified as discontinued for all periods presented.  
     
    Results of Operations    
     
  Revenues and operating expenses for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015 are as follows:  
     
 23   

Casino       Casino revenues decreased $0.8 million, or 0.4%, for the three months ended October 23, 2016, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. 
     
  Casino revenues decreased $0.6 million, or 0.1%, for the six months ended October 2 3, 2016, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. 
     
 24   

Casino operating expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 3.3%, and $1.3 million, or 2.1%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in casino operating expenses reflects our continuing efforts to manage our casino operating expenses.  
     
   Gaming Taxes       State and local gaming taxes decreased $0.3 million, or 0.6%, and $0.6 million, or 0.5%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, which is a result of changes in our overall gaming revenues and changes in the mix of gaming revenues derived from states with different gaming tax rates. 
     
   Rooms       Rooms revenue increased $0.3 million, or 4.9%, and $0.4 million, or 3.4%, during the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
     
   Food, beverage, pari-mutuel and other     Food, beverage, pari-mutuel and other revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 3.5%, and $1.3 million, or 2.5%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from the closures of our buffets in Kansas City and Black Hawk for renovations.  The Kansas City buffet closed during the first quarter and the Black Hawk buffet closed in early September. Both buffets are expected to reopen in December of this year. 
     
   Food, beverage, pari-mutuel and other expense     Food, beverage, pari-mutuel and other expense decreased $0.9 million, or 8.9%, and $1.8 million, or 8.8%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, due in part to the closure of the Kansas City and Black Hawk buffets and initiatives to reduce cost of sales. 
     
   Promotional Allowances       Promotional allowances increased $0.5 million, or 1.1%, and $2.9 million, or 3.4%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, reflecting changes in our marketing programs. 
     
   Marketing and Administrative        Marketing and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 2.3%, for the three months ended October 23, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Excluding a $1.0 million gain on the sale of the Bettendorf vessel and the $0.3 million write-off of costs related to the potential development of a new administration building at Pompano, which we determined we would not move forward with during the quarter, marketing and administrative expenses decreased $0.4 million, or 0.8%, reflecting changes in our marketing programs as well as savings from cost reduction initiatives. 
     
   M arketing and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 million, or 1.8%, for the six months ended October 23, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Excluding a $1.0 million gain on the sale of the Bettendorf vessel and the $0.3 million write-off of costs related to the potential development of a new administration building at Pompano, which we determined we would not move forward with during the quarter, marketing and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 1.0%, reflecting changes in our marketing programs as well as savings from cost reduction initiatives.  
     
   Corporate and Development    Our corporate and development expenses increased $1.3 million during the three months ended October 23, 2016, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, largely a result of less favorable results year over year from our captive insurance company as well as higher legal fees related to ongoing litigation during the quarter. 
     
  During the six months ended October 23, 2016, our corporate and development expenses were $15.5 million compared to $14.6 million for the six months ended October 25, 2015.  
     
   Depreciation and Amortization       Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016 decreased $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the quarter. 
     
 25   

Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes   
     
  Interest expense, interest income, loss on early extinguishment of debt and income tax (provision) benefit for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016 and October 25, 2015 are as follows:  

Interest Expense       Interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 1.2%, and $1.0 million, or 3.1%, for the three and six months ended October 23, 2016, as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in our overall debt balance and the benefit of refinancing our 7.75% Senior Notes in May 2015.  We capitalized interest expense of $0.2 million during the six months ended October 23, 2016, primarily related to our land-based casino construction at our Bettendorf property. We capitalized interest expense of $0.2 million during the six months ended October 25, 2015, primarily related to hotel renovations and land-based casino construction at our Bettendorf property. 
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities -   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we generated $63.0 million in cash flows from operating activities compared to generating $61.4 million during the six months ended October 25, 2015. The year-over-year increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily the result of the increase in operating income. 
     
   Cash Flows used in Investing Activities -   During the six months ended October 23, 2016, we used $46.6 million for investing activities compared to using $22.0 million during the six months ended October 25, 2015. Significant investing activities for the six months ended October 23, 2016 included capital expenditures of $47.6 million, of which $27.9 million related to construction of our land based casino in Bettendorf. Significant investing activities for the six months ended October 25, 2015 included capital expenditures of $33.2 million offset by proceeds received from sales of assets held for sale of $11.4 million. 
     
   Cash Flows used in Financing Activities     During the six months ended October 23, 2016, our net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily utilized to repay $25.2 million in borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
     
 26   

Significant transactions during the  six months ended October 25, 2015 are as follow: 
     
                        On May 14, 2015, we redeemed the remaining $62.2 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes at a price of 103.875%, including accrued and unpaid interest. 
     
                        Net borrowings under our Credit Facility increased $28.1 million. 
     
                        On May 4, 2015, we paid $9.4 million related to our obligation for certain bonds issued by the City of Bettendorf, Iowa. 
     
                        We received $0.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
     
   Availability of Cash and Additional Capital   - At October 23, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $53.9 million and marketable securities of $19.0 million. As of October 23, 2016, we had $42.3 million in outstanding revolving credit borrowings under our Credit Facility and our net line of credit availability was approximately $249.4 million, as limited by our outstanding borrowings and undrawn letters of credit. 
     
   Capital Expenditures and Development Activities    On June 24, 2016, we opened our new land-based casino at our property in Bettendorf. As of October 23, 2016, we have spent $51.6 million on the project, of which $27.9 million was during the six months ended October 23, 2016. We will continue to fund capital projects with cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
     
  Historically, as part of our business development activities, we have entered into agreements which have resulted in the acquisition or development of businesses or assets. These business development efforts and related agreements typically require the expenditure of cash, which may be significant. The amount and timing of our cash expenditures relating to development activities may vary based upon our evaluation of current and future development opportunities, our financial condition and the condition of the financing markets. Our development activities are subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to: obtaining permits, licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies, legislative changes and, in certain circumstances, negotiating acceptable leases.  
     
  Historically, we have made significant investments in property and equipment and expect that our operations will continue to demand ongoing investments to keep our properties competitive. The timing, completion and amount of additional capital projects will be subject to improvement of economic and local market conditions, cash flows from our operations and borrowing availability under our Credit Facility.  
     
  Typically, we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures through operating cash flow and debt financing. While we believe that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for our planned and necessary expenditures or that the level of our capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets.  
     
  We are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms if our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient or if we fail to stay in compliance with the covenants of our Credit Facility. We will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations.  
     
   Critical Accounting Estimates   
     
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management identifies critical accounting estimates as:  
     
 27   

those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made; 
     
                        those estimates where, had we chosen different estimates or assumptions, the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations; and 
     
                        those estimates that, if they were to change from period to period, likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. 
     
  For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no newly identified significant accounting estimates in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, nor were there any material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates set forth in our 2016 Annual Report.  
     
   ITEM 3.                              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
     
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, including interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our Credit Facility.  
     
 28   

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of October 23, 2016.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 23, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act of 1934 and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
   CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   
     
  There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 23, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   ITEM 1.                              LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
     
  A reference is made to the information contained in Footnote 11 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein, which is incorporated herein by reference.  
     
   ITEM 1A.                     RISK FACTORS  
     
  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 24, 2016, except for the following additional risk factors related to our acquisition by Eldorado Resorts, Inc., ( ERI ).  
     
    The merger agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities during the pendency of the merger.    
     
  The merger agreement pursuant to which ERI will acquire Isle subjects us to restrictions on our business activities and obligates us to generally operate our businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects during the pendency of the merger. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the merger and are outside of our ordinary course of business, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  
     
    We would also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees if the merger is not completed.    
     
  The market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the merger will be completed. Consequently, the completion of, the failure to complete, or any delay in the completion of the merger could result in significant changes in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees that will be required to be paid whether or not the merger is consummated. Further, we may be required to pay a termination fee depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination.  
     
    Whether or not the merger is completed, the pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in our businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial results.    
     
  These disruptions could include the following:  
     
 29   

Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company or consider other employment alternatives, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract their respective key managers and other employees; 
     
                        Our current and prospective customers may anticipate changes in how they are served or the benefits offered by the our loyalty reward programs and may, as a result, choose to discontinue their patronage of casinos; and 
     
                        Our management s attention may be diverted from the operation of the businesses toward the completion of the merger. 
     
    Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the merger and may significantly reduce the benefits anticipated to be realized from the merger or could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or our future business and financial results.    
     
  Completion of the merger is subject to various closing conditions, including (a) our stockholders adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger at the Isle Special Meeting, (b) ERI s stockholders approving the issuance of shares at the ERI Special Meeting, (c) the approval or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (d) obtaining certain gaming approvals to the standards set forth in the merger agreement and (e) each of our and ERI s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will be treated as a  reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If such conditions are not satisfied, the merger will not be consummated unless such conditions are validly waived. Such conditions may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger. Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Even if all such consents and approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed by June 19, 2017, assuming that neither we nor ERI elect to extend this deadline as contemplated by the merger agreement, either ERI or we may terminate the merger agreement.  
     
  On October 21, 2016, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act was terminated early by the FTC.  
     
    If the merger is not completed, the price of our common stock and our future business and operations could be harmed.    
     
  If the merger is not completed, we may be subject to material risks, including:  
     
                        failure to complete the merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community; 
     
                        certain costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; 
     
                        the diversion of management attention from day-to-day business and the unavoidable disruption to our employees and relationships with clients as a result of efforts and uncertainties relating to the merger may detract from our ability to grow revenue and minimize costs, which, in turn, may lead to a loss of market position that we could be unable to regain if the merger does not occur; 
     
                        under the merger agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the merger, which may affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; 
     
                        if our Board of Directors seeks another merger or business combination, you cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than ERI  has agreed to pay; and 
     
 30   

the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a higher price than it otherwise would have based on the assumption that the merger will be completed. 
     
   ITEM 2.                              UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
     
  We have purchased our common stock under stock repurchase programs. These programs allow for the repurchase of up to 6,000,000 shares.  To date, we have purchased 4,895,792 shares of our common stock under these programs.  These programs have no approved dollar amount, nor expiration dates.  No purchases have been made under the program since September 2007.
