   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 September 30, 2016   

1. THE
COMPANY  

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by MBC Funding II Corp. ( the Company ), a New York
corporation, formed in December 2015 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation ( MBC ),
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with
instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results to be attained in the entire fiscal year.  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.  

The
Company, organized specifically for the purpose of the public offering of the Notes (see Note 3), recognizes revenues in accordance
with ASC 605, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. ASC
605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue
recognition policies. In general, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery
of the product has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability
is reasonably assured.  

Interest
income from commercial loans is recognized, as earned, over the loan period. Costs incurred in connection with the senior secured
note (See Note 4) issued by the Company are being amortized over ten years, using the straight-line method.  

The
Company was formed in December 2015 by MBC specifically for the purpose of the IPO (See Note 3). Prior to the consummation of
the IPO on April 25, 2016, the Company did not have any material operations. As of April 2016, the Company collects payments of
interest and principal on the mortgages it holds and uses those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of
the Notes (the  Noteholders ) and certain operating expenses (See Note 4).  

2. RECENT
TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The ASU intends to provide users of financial statements with more useful
information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. For public business entities,
the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
For all other entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The adoption of this guidance
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification
in the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. For private companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption
of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments . The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held
at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts. For
public companies who file with SEC, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. For public business entities that are not SEC filers, the ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For privately held companies, ASU 2016-13
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2021. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force.  The ASU is to amend ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance
on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the
standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effected, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a
material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

3. 
PUBLIC OFFERING  

On
April 25, 2016, the Company completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering ( IPO ) of 6% senior secured
notes due April 22, 2026 (the  Notes ). MBC has guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Notes and has
secured that guaranty with a pledge of all the outstanding common shares of the Company it owns. The gross proceeds to the Company
from this offering were $6,000,000, and the net proceeds were approximately $5,200,000, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company utilized the proceeds to purchase a pool of mortgage loans from MBC,
which MBC in turn used to pay down its Webster Credit Line.  

4. SENIOR
SECURED NOTES  

The
Notes are 6% senior secured notes, due April 22, 2026, and have a principal amount of $1,000 each. On April 25, 2016, the Company
issued Notes in the IPO in the aggregate principal amount of $6,000,000 under the Indenture, dated April 25, 2016, among the Company,
as Issuer, MBC, as Guarantor, and Worldwide Stock Transfer LLC ( Worldwide ), as Indenture Trustee (the  Indenture ).
The Notes are listed on the NYSE MKT and trade under the symbol  LOAN/26 . Interest accrues on the Notes commencing
on May 16, 2016. The accrued interest is payable monthly in cash, in arrears, on the 15 th  day of each calendar month
commencing June 2016.  

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by the Company, together with
the Company s cash on hand, must always equal at least 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at
all times. To the extent the aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans owned by the Company plus the Company s cash
on hand is less than 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Notes, the Company is required to repay, on a
monthly basis, the principal amount of the Notes equal to the amount necessary such that, after giving effect to such repayment,
the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans owned by the Company plus, the Company s cash on hand at such time
is equal to or greater than 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. For this purpose, each mortgage loan is deemed
to have a value equal to its outstanding principal balance, unless the borrower is in default of its obligations.  

The
Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time after April 22, 2019 upon at least 30 days prior written notice
to the Noteholders. The redemption price will be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the accrued
but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption, without penalty or premium; provided that (i) if
the Notes are redeemed on or after April 22, 2019 but prior to April 22, 2020, the redemption price will be 103% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii) if the Notes are redeemed on or after April 22, 2020 but prior to April 22, 2021, the redemption
price will be 101.5% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus, in either case, the accrued but unpaid interest on the
Notes redeemed up to, but not including, the date of redemption.  

Each
Noteholder has the right to cause the Company to redeem his, her, or its Notes on April 22, 2021. The redemption price will be
equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the accrued but unpaid interest up to, but not including,
the date of redemption, without penalty or premium. In order to exercise this right, the Noteholder must notify the Company, in
writing, no earlier than November 22, 2020 and no later than January 22, 2021. All Notes that are subject to a properly and timely
notice will be redeemed on April 22, 2021. Any Noteholder who fails to make a proper and timely election will be deemed to have
waived his, her or its right to have his, her or its Notes redeemed prior to the maturity date.  

The
Company is obligated to offer to redeem the Notes if there occurs a  change of control  with respect to the Company
or MBC or if the Company or MBC sell any assets unless, in the case of an asset sale, the proceeds are reinvested in the business
of the seller. The redemption price in connection with a  change of control  will be 101% of the principal amount
of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption
price in connection with an asset sale will be the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid
interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption.  

5. COMMERCIAL
LOANS  

The
Company purchased from MBC a pool of mortgage loans, originated and funded by MBC, each of which is secured by first priority
liens on real property, free and clear of all liens and other security interests (see Notes 3 and 4). To the extent any of the
mortgages are satisfied in full, such mortgages will be replaced with one or more mortgages with similar aggregate principal amount.
At September 30, 2016, the pool of mortgage loans is comprised of 18 loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of
$7,240,000.  

6. DUE
TO PARENT COMPANY  

The
Company utilized the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase a pool of mortgage loans from MBC. Under the Indenture, the aggregate
principal amount of the mortgage loans owned by the Company plus the Company s cash on hand always must be equal to at least
120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes until the Notes are paid in full. The long-term portion of the amount due
to parent company represents the additional 20% of the required security.  

The
short-term portion principally represents the costs paid by MBC on behalf of the Company in connection with the senior secured
notes issuance. The Company collects payments of interest and principal on the mortgages the Company holds and uses those funds
to make the required interest payments to the Noteholders and certain operating expenses. Any excess cash will be distributed
to MBC or held by the Company, in either case, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Item
2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis contains
forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of
certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements .

We
are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation ( MBC ), formed in December
2015, specifically for the purpose of the public offering of the Notes (described below). On April 25, 2016, we sold $6,000,000
aggregate principal amount of our 6% Senior Secured Notes, due April 22, 2026 (the  Notes ), in our initial public
offering ( IPO ). The Notes are secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets, including, primarily, mortgage
notes, mortgages and other transaction documents entered into in connection with first mortgage loans originated and funded by
MBC, which we acquired from MBC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans
owned by us plus our cash on hand always must be equal to at least 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes until
the Notes are paid in full. In addition, MBC has guaranteed our obligations under the Notes and has secured that guaranty with
a pledge of all of our outstanding common shares.  

The
Notes are listed on the NYSE MKT and trade under the symbol  LOAN/26 .  

To
the extent any of the mortgages acquired from MBC are satisfied in full, such mortgages will be replaced with one or more mortgages
with similar aggregate principal amount. At September 30, 2016, the mortgages acquired from MBC are comprised of 18 loans with
an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $7,240,000.  

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO on April 25, 2016, we did not have any material operations. As of April 2016, we collect payments
of interest and principal on the mortgages we hold and use those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of
the Notes and certain operating expenses. Any excess cash will be distributed to MBC or held by us, in either case, to be used
for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016   

Revenue  

Total
revenues of approximately $232,000 represent interest income on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. (See
Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs of approximately $109,000 are attributable to the issuance of the Notes. (See Notes 3 and
4 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

General
and administrative expenses  

General
and administrative expenses of approximately $5,000 are comprised of fees paid to the Indenture trustee and NYSE MKT LLC, bank
fees as well as public relation expenses. (See Note 4 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016   

Revenue  

Total
revenues of approximately $396,000 represent interest income on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. (See
Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs  

Interest
and amortization of debt service costs of approximately $169,000 are attributable to the issuance of the Notes. (See Notes 3 and
4 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

General
and administrative expenses  

General
and administrative expenses of approximately $8,000 are comprised of fees paid to the Indenture trustee and NYSE MKT LLC, bank
fees as well as public relation expenses. (See Note 4 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $45,000 and working capital of approximately $4,767,000.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $216,000 primarily
results from our interest income, offset by the interest expense. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $171,000 primarily reflects the repayment of amounts due to MBC in connection with loans
purchased from MBC (See Note 5 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

On
April 25, 2016, in the IPO we raised gross proceeds of $6.0 million, and net proceeds of approximately $5.2 million, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We utilized the net proceeds to purchase a pool of mortgage
loans from MBC, which MBC in turn used to pay down its Webster Credit Line. (See Note 4 to the financial statements included elsewhere
in this report).  

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by the Company, together with
the Company s cash on hand, must always equal at least 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at
all times. (See Note 4 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report).  

We
anticipate that our current cash balances together with our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations
for the next 12 months.

                                         and Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation
Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that, as of the
Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s (the  SEC ) rules and forms and (ii)
are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)      Changes
                                         in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
