  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
  (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 

1.     Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Maiden Holdings, Ltd. ("Maiden Holdings") and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Maiden") and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP" or "U.S. GAAP") for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
    
  These interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative, if annualized, of those to be expected for the full year. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including these notes, should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Certain reclassifications have been made for   2015   to conform to the   2016   presentation and have no impact on net income and total equity previously reported. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   with the exception of the following: 
    
  Transition related to Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the new guidance under ASU 2015-03 which requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset in the balance sheet. The amortization of such costs is reported as an interest expense. The Company applied this new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The adoption of this new guidance reduced the December 31, 2015 audited consolidated total assets and total liabilities by   $10,067  , respectively, representing the amount of unamortized issuance costs related to our Senior Notes which was previously presented as part of other assets. There was no impact on the net income, related per-share amounts or the retained earnings for the periods affected by the adoption of this guidance.  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts 
    
  In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2015-09 which is aimed at providing users of financial statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity s initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, methodologies and judgments in estimating claims, and the timing, frequency and severity of claims. The new disclosures are required for short-duration insurance contracts issued by insurers. For public business entities, this guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied retrospectively by providing comparative disclosures for each period presented. As this guidance is disclosure-related only, the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s statements of operations and financial position. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 that will change how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. The new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current U.S. GAAP. It does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicability exception. This includes investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify today as available for sale ("AFS") in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

  (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
    
  Accounting for Leases 
    
  In February 2016  ,   the FASB issued final Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842 guidance that requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statement in a manner similar to today's accounting. The guidance also eliminates today's real-estate-specific provisions for all entities. All entities classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. The U.S. GAAP standard is effective for public business entities and certain not-for-profit entities and employee benefit plans for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 guidance that outlines changes for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, such as accounting for forfeitures, which applies to the Company. Under the new guidance, the entities can elect to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, in any annual or interim period for which financial statements haven't been issued or made available for issuance, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  Accounting for Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    
    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's "incurred loss" approach with an "expected loss" model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model. It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 guidance to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance amends ASC 230 Statement of Cash Flows, a principles based requiring judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flow as operating, investing or financing activities which created diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments were classified. The new guidance clarifies that if a receipt or payment has aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, the classification will depend on the predominant source or use. While the new guidance attempts to clarify how the predominance principle should be applied, judgment will still be required. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Entities will have to apply the guidance retrospectively, but if it is impracticable to do so for an issue, the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  Intra-Entity Assets Other Than Inventory 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 guidance that will require entities to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory as expense or benefit, in the period in which the transfer occurs as opposed to being deferred the income tax effects until the intercompany asset has been sold to an outside party, according to the current guidance in effect. The new guidance will require companies to defer the income tax effects only of intercompany transfers of inventory. The companies will be required to apply a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. In addition, companies will record deferred tax balances with an offset to opening retained earnings for amounts they haven't recognized under the new guidance. If a valuation allowance is necessary on the date of the adoption, that allowance will be recorded with an offset to opening retained earnings. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

3. Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company currently has   two   reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance. Our Diversified Reinsurance segment consists of a portfolio of predominantly property and casualty reinsurance business focusing on regional and specialty property and casualty insurance companies primarily located in the U.S. and Europe. Our AmTrust Reinsurance segment includes all business ceded to Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. ("Maiden Bermuda") by subsidiaries of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ("AmTrust"), primarily the AmTrust Quota Share and the European Hospital Liability Quota Share. Please refer to "Note 7. Related Party Transactions" for additional information. In addition to our reportable segments, the results of operations of the former NGHC Quota Share segment and the remnants of the U.S. excess and surplus ("E S") business have been included in the "Other" category. 
    
  The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment profit separately from the results of our investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments on an actual basis except salaries and benefits where management s judgment is applied. The Company does not allocate general corporate expenses to the segments. In determining total assets by reportable segment, the Company identifies those assets that are attributable to a particular segment such as reinsurance balances receivable, reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses, deferred commission and other acquisition expenses, loans, goodwill and intangible assets, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments and prepaid reinsurance premiums. All remaining assets are allocated to Corporate.

4. Investments 
    
  (a) Fixed Maturities and Other Investments 
    
  The original or amortized cost, estimated fair value and gross unrealized gains and losses of investment in fixed maturities and other investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

During the second quarter of 2016, we designated additional fixed maturities with a total fair value of   $155,538   as HTM reflecting our intent to hold these securities to maturity. The net unrealized holding gain of   $15,770   at the designation date was reported in the carrying value of the HTM securities and is amortized through Other Comprehensive Income over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method in a manner consistent with the amortization of any premium or discount.  
    
  The contractual maturities of our fixed maturities are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

4. Investments (continued) 

The following tables summarize fixed maturities and other investments in an unrealized loss position and the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   132   securities in an unrealized loss position with a fair value of   $645,228   and unrealized losses of   $36,488  . Of these securities, there are   94   securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater with a fair value of   $437,528   and unrealized losses of   $34,820  .

4. Investments (continued) 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were approximately   270   securities in an unrealized loss position with a fair value of   $1,891,480   and unrealized losses of   $125,312  . Of these securities, there are   93   securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater with a fair value of   $592,418   and unrealized losses of   $78,282  . 
    
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairments ("OTTI") 
    
  The Company performs quarterly reviews of its investment portfolio in order to determine whether declines in fair value below the amortized cost basis were considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. At   September 30, 2016  , we have determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturities were primarily due to widening of credit spreads since their date of purchase. Because we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to do so until a recovery of fair value to amortized cost, we currently believe it is probable that we will collect all amounts due according to their respective contractual terms. Therefore, we do not consider these fixed maturities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . For the three and nine months ended ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   no   OTTI. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there was a credit impairment in respect of one corporate bond which resulted in the recognition of OTTI of   $1,060   for both periods. 
    
  The following summarizes the credit ratings of our fixed maturities:

(d) Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments 
    
  We are required to maintain assets to serve as collateral for our reinsurance liabilities under various reinsurance agreements. We also utilize trust accounts to collateralize business with our reinsurance counterparties. The assets in trust as collateral are primarily cash and highly rated fixed maturity securities. The fair value of our restricted assets was as follows: 

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  (a) Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
    
  FASB ASC Topic 820,   "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"   ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:  

Level 1     Valuations based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include: exchange-traded equity securities and U.S. treasury bonds;  

Level 2     Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g. interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include: U.S. government-sponsored agency securities; non-U.S. government and supranational obligations; commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"); collateralized loan obligations ("CLO"); corporate and municipal bonds; and

  (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 

Level 3     Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about assumptions that market participants would use. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include: insurance and reinsurance derivative contracts; and hedge and credit funds with partial transparency. 
       
  The availability of observable inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. We use prices and inputs that are current at the measurement date. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified between levels. 
    
  For investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in the Level 1 hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party nationally recognized pricing service provider ("the Pricing Service"). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes the Pricing Service to determine an estimate of fair value. The fair value estimates are included in the Level 2 hierarchy. The Company will challenge any prices for its investments which are considered not to be representation of fair value. If quoted market prices and an estimate from the Pricing Service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on dealer quotations for recent activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued or through consensus pricing of a pricing service. The Company determines whether the fair value estimate is in the Level 2 or Level 3 hierarchy depending on the level of observable inputs available when estimating the fair value. The Company bases its estimates of fair values for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an orderly transaction. 
    
  ASC 825,    Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments"  , requires all entities to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.  
    
  The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to determine the fair value of financial instruments held at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  U.S. government and U.S. agencies     Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association. The fair values of U.S. treasury bonds are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are included in the Level 1 fair value hierarchy. We believe the market for U.S. treasury bonds is an actively traded market given the high level of daily trading volume. The fair values of U.S. agency bonds are determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. agency bonds are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Non-U.S. government and supranational bonds     These securities are generally priced by independent pricing services. The Pricing Service may use current market trades for securities with similar quality, maturity and coupon. If no such trades are available, the Pricing Service typically uses analytical models which may incorporate spreads, interest rate data and market/sector news. As the significant inputs used to price non-U.S. government and supranational bonds are observable market inputs, the fair values of non-U.S. government and supranational bonds are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Asset-backed securities     These securities comprise CMBS and CLO originated by a variety of financial institutions that on acquisition are rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher. These securities are priced by independent pricing services and brokers. The pricing provider applies dealer quotes and other available trade information, prepayment speeds, yield curves and credit spreads to the valuation. As the significant inputs used to price the CMBS and CLO are observable market inputs, the fair value of the CMBS and CLO is included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Corporate bonds     Bonds issued by corporations that on acquisition are rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher. These securities are generally priced by independent pricing services. The spreads are sourced from broker/dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, we obtain non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. As the significant inputs used to price corporate bonds are observable market inputs, the fair values of corporate bonds are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Municipal bonds     Bonds issued by U.S. state and municipality entities or agencies. The fair values of municipal bonds are generally priced by independent pricing services. The pricing services typically use spreads obtained from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used to price the municipal bonds are observable market inputs, municipal bonds are classified within Level 2.

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 
    
  Other investments     Includes both quoted and unquoted investments. The fair value of our quoted equity investment is obtained from the Pricing Service and is classified within Level 1. Unquoted other investments comprise investments in limited partnerships and an investment in preference shares of a start-up insurance producer. The fair values of the limited partnerships are determined by the fund manager based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals, and as such, the fair values are included in the Level 3 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investment in preference shares of a start-up insurance producer was determined using recent private market transactions and as such, the fair value is included in the Level 3 fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Reinsurance balances receivable     The carrying values reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their fair value due to short term nature of the assets.  
    
  Loan to related party     The carrying value reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for this financial instrument approximates its fair value.  
    
  Senior notes         The amount reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for these financial instruments represents the carrying value of the notes. The fair values are based on indicative market pricing obtained from a third-party service provider and as such, are included in the Level 2 hierarchy. 
    
  (b) Fair Value Hierarchy 
    
  The Company s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in ASC 820. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s significant market assumptions. We classified our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the following valuation hierarchy:

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 

The Company utilized a Pricing Service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately   99.9%   of its fixed maturities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Pricing Service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted market prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. treasury bonds generally do not trade on a daily basis, the Pricing Service prepares estimates of fair value measurements using relevant market data, benchmark curves, sector groupings and matrix pricing and these have been classified as Level 2. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   0.1%   of the fixed maturities are valued using the market approach. At each date, a total of   two   securities, or approximately   $5,451   and   $4,943  , respectively, of Level 2 fixed maturities, were priced using a quotation from a broker and/or custodian as opposed to the Pricing Service due to lack of information available. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have not adjusted any pricing provided to us based on the review performed by our investment managers. There have not been any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periods represented by these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  (c) Level 3 Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company has determined that its investments in Level 3 securities are not material to its financial position or results of operations. The following table presents changes in Level 3 for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

  On August 3, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the following quarterly dividend: 

Legal Proceedings  
    
  From time to time, the Company is subject to routine legal proceedings, including arbitrations, arising in the ordinary course of business. These legal proceedings generally relate to claims asserted by or against the Company in the ordinary course of insurance or reinsurance operations. Based on the Company's opinion, the eventual outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  In April 2009, the Company learned that Bentzion S. Turin, the former Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of Maiden Holdings and Maiden Bermuda, sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Labor claiming that his employment with the Company was terminated in retaliation for corporate whistle blowing in violation of the whistle blower protection provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Mr. Turin alleged concerns regarding corporate governance with respect to negotiation of the terms of the Trust Preferred Securities Offering and seeks reinstatement as Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of Maiden Holdings and Maiden Bermuda, back pay and legal fees incurred. On December 31, 2009, the U.S. Secretary of Labor found no reasonable cause for Mr. Turin s claim and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. Mr. Turin objected to the Secretary's  
  findings and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge in the U.S. Department of Labor. The Company moved to dismiss Mr. Turin's complaint, and its motion was granted by the Administrative Law Judge on June 30, 2011.  
    
  On July 13, 2011, Mr. Turin filed a petition for review of the Administrative Law Judge's decision with the Administrative Review Board in the U.S. Department of Labor. The Company filed its brief in opposition to the petition for review on October 19, 2011. On March 29, 2013, the Administrative Review Board reversed the dismissal of the complaint on procedural grounds, and remanded the case to the administrative law judge. The administrative hearing began in September 2014, and we expect it to conclude in 2017. The Company believes that it had ample reason for terminating such employment for good and sufficient legal cause, and the Company believes that the claim is without merit and is vigorously defending this claim.

  On   November 1, 2016  , the Company's Board of Directors authorized the following quarterly dividends:

  Overview 
    
  We are a Bermuda-based holding company formed in June 2007 primarily focused on serving the needs of regional and specialty insurers in the U.S. and Europe by providing innovative reinsurance and capital solutions designed to support their capital needs. We specialize in reinsurance solutions that optimize financing by providing coverage within the more predictable and actuarially credible lower layers of coverage and/or reinsuring risks that are believed to be lower hazard, more predictable and generally not susceptible to significant claims from natural catastrophes. Our tailored solutions include a variety of value added services focused on helping our clients grow and prosper. 
    
  We have operations in Bermuda and the United States which provide reinsurance through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. ("Maiden Bermuda") and Maiden Reinsurance North America, Inc. ("Maiden US"). Maiden Life F rs krings AB ("Maiden LF") is a life insurer organized in Sweden and writes credit life insurance on a primary basis in support of Maiden Global Holdings, Ltd.'s ("Maiden Global") business development efforts.  
    
  Our business consists of two reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance.  
    
  The market conditions in which we operate have historically been cyclical, experiencing periods of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage. The global reinsurance market continues to experience significant competition in most lines of business. Abundant new capital investment from sources not considered traditional investors in the reinsurance industry, primarily in the property catastrophe segment of the reinsurance market, continues to impact overall industry competitive conditions. Developments that could lead to a change in those competitive conditions have either not occurred or have been slow to emerge and the present outlook is for a continuation of the current levels of competition being experienced. 
    
  While the business we write as part of our business model remains somewhat more insulated from these competitive conditions, we continue to experience residual pricing pressures as a result of these broader industry conditions. As market conditions evolve, we continue to maintain our adherence to disciplined underwriting by declining business when pricing, terms and conditions do not meet our underwriting and pricing standards. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of market conditions should the pricing environment become more favorable. 
    
  Since our founding in 2007, we have entered into a series of significant strategic and capital transactions that have transformed the scope and scale of our business while maintaining our low volatility, non-catastrophe risk profile. These transactions have supported the growth in our gross premiums written to in excess of $2.6 billion in 2015 while significantly enhancing our total capital resources. Total capital resources are approximately   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Most recently, on September 15, 2016, the Company's $165.0 million mandatory convertible preference shares - Series B were automatically converted into 12,069,090 of the Company's common shares at a conversion rate of 3.6573 per preference share. 
    
  On June 14, 2016, Maiden Holdings issued $110.0 million 6.625% Senior Notes and used the cash proceeds to fully redeem all of Maiden Holdings North America, Ltd.'s ("Maiden NA") 8.25% 2011 Senior Notes due 2041 on June 15, 2016, thus lowering our cost of capital.

  Three and nine months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015   Financial Highlights 

33 

(1) 
    Operating earnings, operating earnings per common share and annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See "  Key Financial Measures  " for additional information and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measure (net income).  
       
           (2) 
    Please refer to "  Note 8. Earnings per Common Share  " of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. 
       
           (3) 
    Underwriting income is calculated as net premiums earned plus other insurance revenue less net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses directly related to underwriting activities. 
       
           (4) 
    Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio, commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. 
       
           (5) 
    Total investments and cash and cash equivalents includes both restricted and unrestricted.  
       
           (6) 
    Total capital resources is the sum of the Company's principal amount of debt and Maiden shareholders' equity. See "  Key Financial Measures  " for additional information. 
       
           (7) 
    Book value per common share is calculated using common shareholders  equity (shareholders' equity excluding the aggregate liquidation value of our preference shares) divided by the number of common shares outstanding. 
       
           (8) 
    Diluted book value per common share is calculated by dividing common shareholders' equity, adjusted for assumed proceeds from the exercise of dilutive options, by the number of outstanding common shares plus dilutive options and restricted share units (assuming exercise of all dilutive stock based awards). The Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B are excluded at   December 31, 2015  , as they are anti-dilutive. 
       
  Key Financial Measures  
    
  In addition to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, management uses certain key financial measures, some of which are non-GAAP measures, to evaluate its financial performance and the overall growth in value generated for the Company s common shareholders. Management believes that these measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, better explain the Company s results in a manner that allows for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company s business. The non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These key financial measures are:  
    
  Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings per Common Share:   Management believes that the use of operating earnings and diluted operating earnings per share enables investors and other users of the Company s financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that these measures follow industry practice and, therefore, allow the users of financial information to compare the Company s performance with its industry peer group, and that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow the Company, and the insurance industry as a whole, generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.  

34 

Operating earnings are a performance measure used by management to focus on the underlying fundamentals of the Company's operations by excluding, on a recurring basis: (1) net realized gains or losses on investment; (2) foreign exchange and other gains or losses; (3) amortization of intangible assets and non-cash deferred tax expenses; and (4) loss and related activity from our run-off operations comprised of our former segment NGHC Quota Share and our divested U.S. E S business. We exclude net realized gains or losses on investment and foreign exchange and other gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market opportunities and other factors. We do not believe amortization of intangible assets and loss and related activity from our run-off operations are representative of our ongoing business. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our operations. 
    
  We also excluded certain non-recurring expenditures that are material to understanding our results of operations. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we exclude the accelerated amortization of senior note issuance cost.   For the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we also excluded net impairment losses on investment recognized in earnings.  
    
  Operating earnings and diluted operating earnings per common share can be reconciled to the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure as follows: 

Operating Return on Average Common Equity ("Operating ROACE"):   Management uses Operating ROACE as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return attributable to Maiden common shareholders. It is calculated using operating earnings attributable to common shareholders (as calculated above) divided by average Maiden common shareholders' equity. Management has set a long-term target of Operating ROACE at 15%, on average, which management believes provides an attractive return to our common shareholders for the risk they are assuming from investing in our business. 
    
  Operating ROACE   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was computed as follows: 

35 

(1) Average common shareholders' equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is adjusted for the period the Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B are outstanding (prior to mandatory conversion date of September 15, 2016).  
    
  Book Value per Common Share and Diluted Book Value per Common Share  : Management uses growth in both of these metrics as a prime measure of the value we are generating for our common shareholders, as management believes that growth in each metric ultimately results in growth in the Company s common share price. These metrics are impacted by the Company s net income and external factors, such as interest rates, which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio. At   September 30, 2016  , the book value per common share and diluted book value per common share both increased by   22.3%   compared to   December 31, 2015   (see "  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments"   on page 45 for further information). Book value per common share and diluted book value per common share at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was computed as follows:  

(1)     The Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares - Series B are excluded at December 31, 2015, as they are anti-dilutive. 
    
  Ratio of Debt to Total Capital Resources:   Management uses this measure to monitor the financial leverage of the Company. This measure is calculated using the total principal amount of debt divided by the the sum of total capital resources. The ratio of Debt to Total Capital Resources at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was computed as follows:

Results of Operations  
    
  Selected unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income data: 

(1) Calculated by dividing net loss and LAE by net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. 
      (2) Calculated by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. 
      (3) Calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. 
      (4) Calculated by adding together the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. 
      (5) Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio and expense ratio. 

Net Income 
    
  Net income   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $40.7 million   and   $117.5 million   compared to   $28.5 million   and   $93.5 million   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. 
    
   The increase in net income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was due to higher underwriting income and, to a lesser extent, investment income offset partially by lower foreign exchange gains. Underwriting income was favorably impacted by an increase in net premiums earned in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment and lower unfavorable development on our run-off business reported in our Other category. 
    
  The increase in net income   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily driven by an increase in net investment income and, to a lesser extent, improvements in underwriting income. Other factors  
  
   37 

positively impacting net income included slight increases of $2.3 million in foreign exchange gains and $2.2 million in realized gains on investment. 
    
  The following is a summary of the results of our operations   for the three and nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  : 
    
  Net Premiums Written  
    
  Net premiums written increased by   $91.5 million  , or   15.3%  , and   $108.1 million   or   5.3%  ,   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase in net premiums written for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in 2015 included growth in both the AmTrust Reinsurance and Diversified Reinsurance segments. 
    
  The following tables compare net premiums written by our reportable segments, reconciled to the total consolidated net premiums written: 

The increases in net premiums written in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   are due to organic growth as well as acquisitions made by AmTrust, partially offset by the impact of the 2015 partial commutation. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the initial cession of certain of these acquisitions resulted in a growth rate compared to the same period in 2015 that may not be representative of quarterly growth rates on a prospective basis. Please refer to the analysis of our AmTrust Reinsurance segment on page 42 for further details.  
    
  Net premiums written in our Diversified Reinsurance segment increased by   $15.4 million   or   9.4%   and   $23.8 million   or   4.0%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase was mainly due to growth in the Diversified Reinsurance segment's U.S. casualty and accident and health premiums and the European treaty contracts written by Maiden Bermuda in 2016. Please refer to the analysis of our Diversified Reinsurance segment on page 40 for further details. 
    
  Net Premiums Earned  
    
  Net premiums earned increased by   $39.8 million   or   6.0%   and   $106.6 million   or   5.8%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase in net premiums earned was primarily the result of strong growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment offset by the decrease in our Diversified Reinsurance segment earned premiums. 
    
  The following tables compare net premiums earned by our reportable segments, reconciled to the total consolidated net premiums earned: 

38 

The increase in net premiums earned in the AmTrust Reinsurance segment   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , reflects the impact of AmTrust's strong growth in 2015 from a combination of acquisition activity and ongoing organic growth. Please refer to the analysis of our AmTrust Reinsurance segment on page 42 for further discussion.  
    
   Net premiums earned in our Diversified Reinsurance segment decreased by   $18.0 million   or   9.4%   and   $32.6 million   or   5.7%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Earned premiums decreased due to the impact of lower 2015 net premiums written for the segment. Please refer to the analysis of our Diversified Reinsurance segment on page 40 for further discussion.  
    
  Other Insurance Revenue  
    
  All of our Other Insurance Revenue is produced by our Diversified Reinsurance segment. Please refer to page 42 for further discussion.  
    
  Net Investment Income and Net Realized Gains on Investment  
    
  Net Investment Income -   Net investment income increased by   $2.9 million   or   8.6%   and   $11.1 million   or   11.5%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , average investable assets grew by   14.0%   and   15.0%   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The Company's average book yield for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was marginally lower compared to the same period in 2015. The growth in net investment income, particularly when compared with the growth in invested assets, continues to be impacted by the low current interest rate environment along with elevated levels of cash maintained by the Company in response to recent volatility within that interest rate environment.  
    
  The following table details the Company's average investable assets and average book yield: 

(1)   The average of the sum of the cost or amortized cost of the Company's investments, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), loan to related party and due to broker at the beginning and end of each quarter during the last three months and twelve months, respectively. 
   (2)   Annualized       ratio of net investment income over average investable assets. 
    
  Net Realized Gains on Investment -   Net realized gains on investment were   $1.9 million   and   $4.5 million     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.2 million   and   $2.3 million   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. 

Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses  
    
  Net loss and LAE increased by   $22.6 million   or   5.1%   and   $60.9 million   or   4.9%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. This increase reflects the continued growth of the business combined with net adverse development experienced in the Diversified Reinsurance segment. 
    
  The net loss and LAE ratios were generally stable at   66.6%   and   66.2%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   67.2%   and   66.7%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The impact on the net loss and LAE ratios should be considered in conjunction with the commission and other acquisition expense ratio as changes to either ratio arise primarily due to changes in the mix of business and the impact of the change in the commission and other acquisition expense rates on quota share contracts with loss sensitive features.  
  
   39 

Commission and Other Acquisition Expenses  
    
  Commission and other acquisition expenses increased by   $9.1 million   or   4.6%   and   $35.9 million   or   6.5%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The commission and other acquisition expense ratio decreased to   29.5%   and increased to   30.0%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   29.9%   and   29.7%   for the same periods in 2015, respectively. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the ratio discussed in the   Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses   section above.    
    
  General and Administrative Expenses  
    
  General and administrative expenses include expenses which are segregated for analytical purposes as a component of underwriting income and comprise: 

Total general and administrative expenses increased by   $0.5 million   or   3.0%  , and   $0.7 million   or   1.6%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Interest and Amortization Expenses  
    
  The interest and amortization expenses related to our Senior Notes were $6.9 million and $21.3 million   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $7.3 million and $21.8 million for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The weighted average effective interest rate for the Company's debt was   7.8%   and   8.1%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   8.3%   for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . Refer to "  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Long Term Debt  " included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of the Company s Senior Notes.  
    
  On June 15, 2016, Maiden NA fully redeemed all of its 2011 Senior Notes using the proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes issuance. The 2011 Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of $107.5 million plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed up to, but not including, the redemption date. As a result, the Company accelerated the amortization of the remaining debt issuance cost of $2.3 million. 
    
  Income Tax Expense  
    
  The Company recorded an income tax expense of   $0.2 million   and   $1.2 million     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.3 million   and   $1.6 million   for the same periods in 2015, respectively. These amounts relate to income tax on the earnings of our international subsidiaries and state taxes incurred by our U.S. subsidiaries. The effective rate of income tax was 0.5% and 1.0%   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to 1.3% and 1.7% for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Dividends on Preference Shares  
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , dividends paid to preference shareholders increased by $2.9 million  or 48.3% and $9.4 million or 51.9% compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively. The increase is attributable to the issuance of 6,600,000 7.125% Preference Shares - Series C on November 25, 2015. 

Underwriting Results by Reportable Segment 
    
  Diversified Reinsurance Segment  
    
  The underwriting results and associated underwriting ratios for the Diversified Reinsurance segment were as follows:  
  
   40 

The combined ratio   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased to   102.2%   and remained flat at   102.8%   compared to   103.6%   and   102.8%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Reserve development in commercial auto continued to unfavorably impact the Diversified Reinsurance segment resulting in underwriting losses both   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Premiums -   Gross premiums written increased by   $12.5 million   or   7.1%   and   $36.1 million   or   5.7%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase was primarily due to growth in U.S. casualty and accident and health premiums and the European treaty contracts written by Maiden Bermuda in 2016.  
    
  Net premiums written increased by   $15.4 million   or   9.4%   and   $23.8 million   or   4.0%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively, due to the same circumstances as described above related to this segment's gross premiums written. The following tables illustrate net premiums written by line of business in this segment:  

41 

Net premiums earned decreased by   $18.0 million   or   9.4%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   and decreased by   $32.6 million   or   5.7%     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The following table shows net premiums earned by line of business:  

Within the Diversified Reinsurance segment, the business written by both Maiden US and our non-U.S. operations experienced a decrease in net premiums earned for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to the decline in written premium in   2015  . Net premiums earned were also reduced further due to the impact of higher ceded premiums related to the retrocessional quota share agreement entered in 2015. These decreases, however, were slightly reduced by earned premiums from the European treaty contracts written by Maiden Bermuda in 2016. 
    
  Other Insurance Revenue -   Other insurance revenue increased by   $0.1 million  , or   7.7%   and decreased by   $0.7 million   or   7.6%  ,   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The net decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly caused by weaker auto sales in Europe. 
    
  Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense -   Net loss and LAE decreased by   $10.1 million   or   7.1%     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and decreased by   $22.2 million   or   5.3%     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Net loss and LAE ratios were   74.6%   and   72.4%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   72.9%   and   72.0%   in the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The impact on the net loss and LAE ratios should be considered in conjunction with the commission and other acquisition expense ratio as changes to these ratios are significantly impacted by changes in the mix of business and the impact of loss sensitive features. The loss and LAE ratios in 2016 continue to be impacted by adverse development in U.S. commercial auto. 
    
  Commission and Other Acquisition Expenses -   Commission and other acquisition expenses decreased by   $11.8 million  , or   22.9%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and decreased by   $12.4 million   or   8.2%     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The commission and other acquisition expense ratios were   22.5%   and   25.6%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   26.5%   and   26.3%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Please refer to the reasons for the changes in the ratio discussed in the   Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses   section above. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses -   General and administrative expenses increased by   $0.8 million  , or   10.0%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and increased by   $0.7 million   or   2.9%  ,   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The general and administrative expense ratios were   5.1%   and   4.8%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   4.2%   and   4.5%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  
    
  AmTrust Reinsurance Segment  
    
  The AmTrust Reinsurance segment reported continuing profitable growth   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. However, the segment experienced a modest increase in the combined ratio to 95.9% from 95.4% during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and to 95.4% from 95.1% during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively. These increases were largely due to changes in the mix of business and higher commercial auto loss ratios. 
  
   42 

The following table details the underwriting results and associated ratios for the AmTrust Reinsurance segment: 

Premiums -   Gross premiums written increased by   $65.9 million  , or   14.5%   and   $86.3 million   or   5.7%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment is due to additional 2016 premium relating to acquisitions made by AmTrust ceded for the first time and ongoing organic growth and also reflects the removal of certain classes of business which we commuted with AmTrust in the fourth quarter of 2015. These items significantly impacted the comparisons between the respective periods reported herein for 2016 and 2015.  
    
  The following tables details net premiums written by line of business in this segment: 

Net premiums earned increased by   $57.8 million   or   12.4%   and   $139.2 million   or   10.9%  ,   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase is primarily due to AmTrust's prior year written premium growth. 

The following tables detail net premiums earned by line of business:  

43 

Net Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense -   Net loss and LAE increased by   $36.5 million   or   12.3%   and   $87.7 million   or   10.8%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Net loss and LAE ratios were   63.9%   and   63.5%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   63.9%   and   63.6%   in the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The loss ratio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   has improved primarily due to continued change in the segment's mix of business.  
    
  Commission and Other Acquisition Expenses -   Commission and other acquisition expenses increased by   $20.8 million   or   14.3%   and   $48.4 million   or   12.1%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The commission and other acquisition expense ratios were   31.9%   and   31.7%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   31.4%   and   31.3%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The increase in the ratio during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively, reflects the higher proportion of net premiums earned from the Reinsurance Agreement, which has a higher commission rate than the European Hospital Liability Quota Share.  
    
  General and Administrative Expenses -   General and administrative expenses increased by   $0.1 million   or   15.7%   and $0.1 million or 4.9%   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. The general and administrative expense ratios remained flat at   0.1%   and 0.2%   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Liquidity  
    
  Maiden Holdings is a holding company and transacts no business of its own. We therefore rely on cash flows in the form of dividends, advances and loans and other permitted distributions from our subsidiary companies to make dividend payments on our common and preference shares.  
    
  The jurisdictions in which our operating subsidiaries are licensed to write business impose regulations requiring companies to maintain or meet statutory solvency and liquidity requirements. Some jurisdictions also place restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and other distributions.  
    
   The regulatory and liquidity requirements of the Company's operating segments are discussed in "  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   section included under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016. 
    
  Our sources of funds primarily consist of premiums received (net of commissions), investment income, net proceeds from capital raising activities, which may include the issuance of debt, common and preference shares, and proceeds from sales and redemption of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay loss and LAE, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and dividends, with the remainder in excess of our operating requirements, made available to our investment managers for investment in accordance with our investment policy. The following table summarizes the cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities: 
  
   44 

Cash Flows - Operating Activities 
    
  Cash flows from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $326.2 million   compared to   $526.0 million   for the same period in   2015  , a   38.0%   decrease. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities arises primarily due to the settlement of the $107.0 million commutation with AmTrust during the first quarter of 2016. Operating cash flows in 2015 were also favorably impacted by AmTrust's integration of Tower Group which now has been completed. The increase in reserve for loss and LAE during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was lower by $17.5 million while the increase in unearned premiums during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was lower by $15.0 million compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Cash Flows - Investing Activities 
    
  Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and payments for investments acquired. Net cash used in investing activities was   $291.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $470.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . Purchases of fixed maturity investments exceeded the proceeds from the sales, maturities and calls by   $187.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In addition there was an increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents of   $103.7 million   and a net outflow in other items of $0.1 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cash Flows - Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flows used in financing activities were   $59.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $44.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in net cash outflow for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the increase in the dividends paid to both common and preference shareholders of   $2.4 million   and   $9.5 million  , respectively, representing the increase in the dividend per common share from $0.13 to $0.14 and the dividend on the Preference shares - Series C of   $9.5 million   following issuance on November 25, 2015. Furthermore, on June 15, 2016, Maiden NA fully redeemed all of its 2011 Senior Notes using the net proceeds from the 6.625% 2016 Senior Notes issuance of $106.5 million on June 14, 2016. The 2011 Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of   $107.5 million  . Also, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the proceeds from the issuance of common shares were lower by   $2.4 million   compared to the same period last year. 
    
  Restrictions, Collateral and Specific Requirements  
    
   The Company's restrictions, collateral and specific requirements are discussed in "  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  " section included under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments used as collateral were   $4.4 billion   and   $3.7 billion  , respectively. This collateral represents   89.1%   and   82.6%   of the fair value of our total fixed maturity investments and cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash and and cash equivalents) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in assets provided as collateral for the AmTrust Reinsurance segment reflecting continued growth. 
    
  Investments  
    
  The investment of our funds is designed to ensure safety of principal while generating current income. Accordingly, our funds are invested in liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and are designated as either available-for-sale ("AFS") or held-to-maturity ("HTM").  
    
  The value of the Company's fixed maturity investments increased by $392.4 million or 9.5% at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  . The net increase is a combination of: 1) purchases of $786.6 million, comprising of primarily investment grade corporate bonds; and 2) net unrealized gains and amortization of $146.2 million; offset by 3) maturities and calls totaling $540.4 million. 
    
   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the yield on the 10-year U.S. treasury bond decreased by 67 basis points to 1.60%. The 10-year U.S. treasury is the key risk-free determinant in the fair value of many of the securities in our AFS portfolio. The decrease in interest rates for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   reflects slower than expected global economic growth, various conflicting economic indicators, combined with equity market volatility and increased global geopolitical uncertainties. 
  
   45 

The increase in unrealized gain in our AFS fixed maturity portfolio was $142.2 million, primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and the recovery of market values of corporate bonds. This gain also includes unrealized foreign exchange gains of $8.1 million arising on our non-U.S. dollar denominated investment portfolio, primarily on our euro-denominated investments, following the strengthening of the euro at   September 30, 2016  , relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase was substantially offset by increases in our non-U.S. dollar net liabilities which are reflected in the movement of cumulative translation adjustment, which is also a component of AOCI, in our shareholders' equity. See "  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Resources"   on page 51 for further information. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we consider the levels of cash and cash equivalents we are holding to be above our targeted ranges. However, this is consistent with our practice during prior periods when interest rates and fixed income markets have experienced elevated levels of volatility. We continue to assess current market conditions and are seeking opportunities, within our defined risk appetite to deploy available cash. 
    
  In order to limit our exposure to unexpected interest rate increases which would reduce the value of our fixed income securities and reduce our shareholders' equity, we attempt to maintain the duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio combined with our cash and cash equivalents, both restricted and unrestricted, within a reasonable range of the duration of our loss reserves. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these respective durations in years were as follows: 

The decrease of 0.6 years in the weighted average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio arises predominantly due to decrease in the duration of our U.S. agency bonds   mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") portfolio reflecting the impact of the volatility in interest rates on paydowns combined with the purchase of corporate bonds during the period with a lower duration than the fixed maturity investment portfolio at   December 31, 2015   and a more elevated cash level compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The differential in duration between these assets and liabilities may fluctuate over time and in the case of fixed maturities, is affected by factors such as market conditions, changes in asset mix and prepayment speeds in the case of both our Agency MBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"). 
    
   The average yield and average duration of our fixed maturities, by asset class, and our cash and cash equivalents (restricted and unrestricted) are as follows: 

46 

*Average yield is calculated by dividing annualized investment income for each sub-component of AFS securities and cash and cash equivalents (including amortization of premium or discount) by amortized cost. 
    
  The following summarizes the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio holdings by contractual maturity: 

Substantially all of the Company s U.S. agency bond holdings are mortgage-backed. Additional details on the MBS component of our U.S. agency bonds portfolio are as follows:  
  
   47 

The following summarizes changes in fair value associated with our U.S. agency bonds - mortgage-backed portfolio:       

Our total Agency MBS portfolio represents   35.6%   of our fixed maturity investments at   September 30, 2016  . Given the relative size of this portfolio to our total investments, if faster prepayment patterns were to occur over an extended period of time, this could potentially limit the growth in our investment income in certain circumstances, or even potentially reducing the total amount of investment income we earn. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   96.4%   and   97.5%  , respectively, of our fixed maturity investments consisted of investment grade securities. We define a security as being below investment grade if it has an Standard   Poor's ("S P") credit rating of BB+, or equivalent, or less. See "  Part I, Item I - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) Note 4. Investments  " for additional information on the credit rating of our fixed income portfolio. 
    
  The security holdings by sector and financial strength rating by S P of our corporate bond holdings (AFS and HTM) are as follows:      
  
   48 

*Based on Standard   Poor s ("S P"), or equivalent, ratings 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company decreased its exposure to securities rated BBB (including those with a + or - modifier) from 23.3% as at December 31, 2015 to   19.8%   of the total fair value of investments and cash and cash equivalents.  
    
  The Company s 10 largest corporate holdings, 64.5% of which are in the Financial Institutions sector, are as follows:  
  
   49 

*Based on S P, or equivalent, ratings 
  (1) Securities with the notation FLT are floating rate securities. 
    
  We own the following securities not denominated in U.S. dollars: 

These non-U.S. dollar fixed maturities were invested in the following currencies: 

The net increase in non-U.S. denominated fixed maturities is primarily due to the investment of net premiums received and the increase in unrealized gains related to euro denominated investments. We do not have any government and government related obligations of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   100.0%   of the Company's non-U.S. government and supranational issuers were rated A+ or higher by S P, respectively.  
    
  For our non-U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, the following summarizes the composition of the fair value of our fixed maturity investments at the dates indicated by ratings:  
  
   50 

*Based on S P, or equivalent, ratings 
    
  The Company does not employ any credit default protection against any of the fixed maturities held in non-U.S. denominated currencies. 
    
  Other Changes in Financial Position  
    
  The following summarizes other changes in our financial position: 

The reinsurance balances receivable, net increased by   $157.7 million  , or   41.8%  , primarily due to the continued growth of our AmTrust Reinsurance segment during the first nine months of 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 which was lowered by the commutation agreement with AmTrust of $107.0 million. The reserve for net loss and LAE increased following the continued growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment and, to a lesser extent, adverse loss development experienced in our Diversified Reinsurance segment and our divested U.S. E S business. The unearned premiums also increased following the continued growth in our AmTrust Reinsurance segment combined with the impact of greater number of renewals in the first quarter relative to renewals in the fourth quarter.

  Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed in support of our business operations. Our total capital resources were   $1,917.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a net increase of   $210.0 million  , or   12.3%  , from   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The movement in total capital resources is as follows: 

The major factors contributing to the net increase in capital resources were as follows: 
    
  Maiden shareholders' equity 
    
  Maiden shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016   increased by   $207.5 million  , or   15.4%  , compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to: 

51 

increase in AOCI of $147.6 million. This increase arose due to: 1) increase of $155.6 million which arose from the net increase in our U.S. dollar denominated investment portfolio of $130.6 million relating to market price movements and the increase in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investment portfolio of $25.0 million. The increase in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investment portfolio was $8.1 million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro, relative to U.S. dollar at   September 30, 2016   compared to December 31, 2015, and $16.9 million as a result of market price movements during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . See "  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments  " on page 45 for further information; offset by 2) decrease in the cumulative translation adjustment of   $8.0 million   due to the effect of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the original currencies on our non-U.S. dollar net liabilities (excluding non- U.S. dollar denominated AFS fixed maturities);  

net income attributable to Maiden shareholders of $117.7 million. See "  Results of Operations   -   Net Income  " on page 37 for a discussion of the Company s net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ;  

increase in additional paid in capital of $2.6 million resulting from share-based transactions; and  

increase in common shares and additional paid in capital of $165.6 million as result of the conversion of the Company's Preference Shares - Series B into common shares on September 15, 2016 and exercise of options. 
       
  These increases were offset by the following: 

dividends declared of $60.5 million on the Company s common and preference shares during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ;  

increase in shares repurchased for treasury of $0.5 million which represents withholdings from employees surrendered in respect of tax obligations on the vesting of restricted shares and performance based shares; and  

decrease in Preference Shares - Series B of $165.0 million as result of the conversion into common shares on September 15, 2016. 
       
  On July 24, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of the Company's common shares from time to time at market prices. No share repurchases have taken place to date under this plan. 
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  On June 14, 2016, Maiden Holdings issued $110.0 million 6.625% 2016 Senior Notes for cash to be used for the repayment of outstanding, higher coupon indebtedness. Refer to "  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Long-Term Debt  " for further information regarding the new issuance. 
    
  Following the issuance of 2016 Senior Notes, on June 15, 2016, Maiden NA fully redeemed all of its 8.25% 2011 Senior Notes due 2041. The Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. As a result, the Company accelerated the amortization of the remaining debt issuance cost of $2.3 million.  
    
  Except as discussed above, there were no further changes in the Company s Senior Notes at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   and the Company did not enter into any short-term borrowing arrangements during the   nine months ended     ended   September 30, 2016  . Refer to "  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Long Term Debt  " included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of the Company s Senior Notes.  
    
  We have, and expect to continue, to fund a portion of our capital requirements through issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common or preference shares. For flexibility, we have a current universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common shares, preference shares and warrants to purchase such securities. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. 
    
  Financial Strength Ratings  
    
   Our principal operating subsidiaries are rated "BBB+" (Good) with a stable outlook by Standard   Poor's ("S P"), which is the eighth highest of twenty-two rating levels. On September 1, 2016, A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") upgraded our principal operating subsidiaries' financial strength rating to A (Excellent) with a stable outlook, which rating is the third highest of sixteen rating levels, from A- (Excellent) with a positive outlook, as previously disclosed in the "  Financial Strength Ratings  " of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Aggregate Contractual Obligations  
    
  In the normal course of its business, the Company is a party to a variety of contractual obligations as summarized in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . These contractual obligations are considered by the Company when assessing its liquidity requirements and the Company is confident in its ability to meet all of its obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , there are no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations as disclosed in the Company s table of contractual obligations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Currency and Foreign Exchange  
    
  We conduct business in a variety of foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, the principal exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Swedish krona and the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar may materially impact our results and financial position. Our principal exposure to foreign currency risk is our obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies. In addition, in order to minimize this risk we maintain and expect to continue to maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may employ various strategies (including hedging) to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. To the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective, our results of operations or equity may be reduced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. At   September 30, 2016  , no such hedges or hedging strategies were in force or had been entered into.  
    
  Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and divisions whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at the prevailing exchange rates at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The net effect of the translation adjustments is included in AOCI, net of applicable deferred income tax. Monetary assets and liabilities, such as premiums receivable and the reserve for losses and LAE, denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in net income. Accounts that are classified as non-monetary, such as deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserves, are not revalued. In the case of foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities which are classified as AFS, the change in exchange rates between the local currency in which the investments are denominated and the Company s functional currency at each balance sheet date is included in unrealized appreciation or decline in value of securities, a component of AOCI, net of applicable deferred income tax. 
    
  We recorded net foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net foreign exchange gains of $6.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, in particular versus the euro and British pound.  
    
  Effects of Inflation 
    
  The effects of inflation are considered implicitly in pricing and estimating reserves for loss and LAE. The effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future. To the extent inflation is greater than anticipated in the pricing of our business and to the extent unanticipated inflation causes these costs, particularly medical treatments and litigation costs, to increase above reserves established for these claims, the Company will be required to increase the reserve for loss and LAE with a corresponding reduction in its earnings and shareholders' equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. The actual effects of inflation on the results of operations of the Company cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

See "  Part I, Item 1 - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies  " for a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  
    
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
    
  Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses on our investments due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the market in which the related underlying assets are invested. We believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk: changes in interest rates; changes in credit quality of issuers of investment securities and reinsurers; and foreign currency risk.  
    
  Interest Rate Risk  
    
  Interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in AFS fixed maturity securities. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities. At   September 30, 2016  , we had AFS fixed maturity securities with a fair value of   $3.7 billion   that are subject to interest rate risk.  
    
  The following table summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our AFS fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016   to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, and the associated impact on our shareholders  equity. Temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held as AFS do impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders  equity as a component of other comprehensive income. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  :  

The interest rate sensitivity on the   $168.0 million   loan to related party, which carries an interest rate of one month LIBOR plus 90 basis points, is that increases of 100 and 200 basis points in LIBOR would increase our earnings and cash flows by $1.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, on an annual basis, but would not affect the carrying value of the loan.  
    
  Counterparty Credit Risk  
    
  The concentrations of the Company s counterparty credit risk exposures at   September 30, 2016   have not changed materially compared to   December 31, 2015  . The Company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity securities. The Company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in our security purchases. The Company believes this high quality concentration reduces its exposure to credit risk on fixed income securities to an acceptable level. The following table summarizes the Company's fixed maturity investments by major rating category: 

* Based on S P, or equivalent, ratings 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk on its investments, excluding securities issued by the U.S. government which are rated AA+ by S P (see "  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments"   on  
  
   53 

page 45), with the single largest corporate issuer and the top 10 corporate issuers accounting for only   0.9%   and   5.2%   of the Company s total fixed income securities fair value, respectively.  
    
  The Company is exposed to credit risk for business written through brokers if any of the Company s brokers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to payments to the Company. In addition, in some jurisdictions, if the broker fails to make payments to the insured under the Company s policy, the Company might remain liable to the insured for the deficiency. The Company s exposure to such credit risk is somewhat mitigated in certain jurisdictions by contractual terms. See "  Business and Risk Factors"   in Item 1 and 1A of Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2016, respectively, for detailed information on three brokers that accounted for approximately   36.9%   of the Company s gross premiums written in the Diversified Reinsurance segment for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The Company is also exposed to credit risk on reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses. We are also subject to the credit risk that AII and/or AmTrust will fail to perform their obligations to pay interest on and repay principal of amounts loaned to AmTrust. Reinsurance balances receivable from the Company s clients at   September 30, 2016   were   $535.0 million  , including balances both currently due and accrued. The Company believes that credit risk related to these balances is mitigated by several factors, including but not limited to, credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances. In addition, as the vast majority of its reinsurance agreements give the Company the contractual right to offset reinsurance balances receivable from clients, and the loan to related party in the case of AmTrust, against losses payable to them, the Company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible. There was no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance balances receivable at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company requires its reinsurers to have adequate financial strength. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible. The balance of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses was   $97.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $71.2 million   at the end of   December 31, 2015  . Of these reinsurance recoverables, at   September 30, 2016  ,   $17.0 million   or   17.5%  , compared to   $35.0 million   or   49.2%  , at   December 31, 2015   relates to reinsurance claims from Superstorm Sandy. 
    
  The following table summarizes the credit ratings by A.M. Best of the Company's exposure to reinsurance counterparties: 

At   September 30, 2016  , 98.4% (  December 31, 2015   - 69.4%) of reinsurance recoverables were collateralized. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  The Company is generally able to match foreign currency denominated assets against its net reinsurance liabilities both by currency and duration to protect the Company against foreign exchange and interest rate risks. However, a natural offset does not exist for all currencies. For the   nine months ended   and as at   September 30, 2016  ,   $140.9 million   or   6.6%  , of our net premiums written and   $280.9 million   or   10.2%  , of our reserve for loss and LAE were transacted in euro, respectively.  
    
  Refer to the "  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"   section included under Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a general overview on the uncertain economic issues relating to the euro that may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations in its participating countries. 
    
  We may employ various strategies to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. To the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective, our results of operations or equity may be reduced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. At   September 30, 2016  , no hedging instruments have been entered into. 
    
  Our principal foreign currency exposure is to the euro and British pound, however, assuming all other variables remain constant and disregarding any tax effects, a strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar exchange rate of 10% or 20% relative to the non-U.S. currencies held by the Company would result in a decrease (increase) in the Company's net assets of   $7.8 million   and   $15.6 million  , respectively. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated  
  
   54 

to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide an absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.  
    
  During the most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   55 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those identified in Item 1A. of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  , that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity and that could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period. The risks described in our   2015   Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.  
    
  There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   and Quarterly Report 10-Q for the period ended June 30,   2016  .
