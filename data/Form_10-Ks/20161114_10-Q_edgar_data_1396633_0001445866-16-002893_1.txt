(UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Summer Energy Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Summer Energy, LLC ("Summer LLC"), Summer EM Marketing, LLC ("Marketing LLC") and Summer Energy of Ohio, LLC ("Summer Ohio") (collectively referred to as the "Company," "we," "us," or "our").  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 30, 2016.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

NOTE 3  -  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Revenue Recognition 

Our electricity revenue is recognized by our Company upon delivery of electricity to a customer's meter.  This method of revenue recognition is commonly referred to as the flow method.  The flow method of revenue relies upon Electric Reliability Council of Texas ("ERCOT") settlement statements to determine the estimated revenue for a given month. Supply delivered to customers for the month, measured on a daily basis, provides the basis for revenues.  Electricity revenue consists of proceeds from energy sales, including, pass through charges from the Transmission and Distribution Providers ("TDSPs") billed to the customer at cost.

6 

NOTE 3  -  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED) 

Unbilled Revenue and Accounts Receivable 

Electric services not billed by month-end are accrued based upon estimated deliveries to customers as tracked and recorded by ERCOT multiplied by our average billing rate per kilowatt hour ("kWh") in effect at the time.  At the end of each calendar month, revenue is accrued to unbilled receivables based on the estimated amount of power delivered to customers using the flow technique.  Unbilled revenue also includes accruals for estimated TDSP charges and monthly service charges applicable to the estimated electricity usage for the period.  All charges that were physically billed to customers in the calendar month are recorded from the unbilled account to the customer receivable account.  Unbilled accounts as of September 30, 2016, were estimated at $13,003,866.

Accounts receivable are customer obligations billed at the customer's monthly meter read date for that period's electricity usage and due within 16 days of the date of the invoice.  Balances past due are subject to a late fee that is assessed on that billing.

The Company determines the allowance based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical write-off experience and existing economic conditions. Receivables past due over 90 days are considered delinquent and reviewed individually for collectability.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company adjusted the allowance to equal all billed accounts receivables over 90 days plus a percentage for unbilled account receivables based upon the historical collection experience.  The change in the estimate to the allowance had an impact to increase net income $261,000 for the quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (77% and by 16%, respectively).  Management has determined that the allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 at $1,324,715.

Cost Recognition 

Direct energy costs are recorded when the electricity is delivered to the customer's meter.

Cost of Goods Sold ("COGS") include electric power purchased and pass through charges from the TDSP's in the areas serviced by the Company.  TDSP charges are costs for metering services and maintenance of the electric grid.  TDSP charges are established by regulation of the PUCT.

The energy portion of our COGS is comprised of two components:  bilateral wholesale costs and balancing/ancillary costs.  These two cost components are incurred and recognized differently as follows:

Bilateral wholesale costs are incurred through contractual arrangements with wholesale power suppliers for firm delivery of power at a fixed volume and fixed price.  We are invoiced for these wholesale volumes at the end of each calendar month for the volumes purchased for delivery during the month, with payment due 20 days after the end of the month.

Balancing/ancillary costs are based on the customer load and are determined by ERCOT through a multiple step settlement process.  Balancing costs/revenues are related to the differential between supply that we provided through our bilateral wholesale supply and the supply required to serve our customer load.  The Company endeavors to minimize the amount of balancing/ancillary costs through our load forecasting and forward purchasing programs.

NOTE 4  SERIES B PREFERRED SHARES

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Section 27A of the Securities Act, and is subject to the safe harbors created by those sections.  Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.  Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements.

Due to possible uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, or to make predictions about future performance based solely on historical financial performance.  We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report.

Readers should carefully review the risk factors described below under the heading "Risk Factors"  and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  Our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those filings, pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge at www.summerenergy.com, when such reports are available via the EDGAR system maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

Recent Developments

The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Summer Energy Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Summer Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Summer LLC"), Summer EM Marketing, LLC ("Marketing LLC") and Summer Energy of Ohio, LLC ("Summer Ohio") (collectively referred to as the "Company," "we," "our," or "us").

On March 27, 2012, Summer LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Summer Energy Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Castwell Precast Corporation) through a reverse acquisition transaction, which resulted in the former members of Summer LLC owning approximately 92.3% of the Summer Energy Holdings, Inc. outstanding common stock.  Our sole operations are conducted through Summer LLC.

Marketing LLC was formed in the state of Texas on November 6, 2012 to provide marketing services to Summer LLC.

Plan of Operation

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Summer LLC, is a licensed Retail Electricity Provider (REP) in the State of Texas.  In general, Texas regulatory structure permits REPs, such as Summer LLC, to procure and sell electricity at unregulated prices.  REPs pay the local transmission and distribution utilities a regulated tariff rate for delivering electricity to their customers.  As a REP, we sell electricity and provide the related billing, customer service, collections and remittance services to residential and commercial customers.  We offer retail electricity to commercial and residential customers in designated target markets within the State of Texas.  In the commercial market, the primary target is small to medium-sized customers (less than one megawatt of peak usage), but we will also selectively pursue larger commercial customers through management's existing, historical relationships.  Residential customers are a secondary target market.  We anticipate that a majority of our customers will be located in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas; although, we anticipate a growing number will be located in a variety of other metropolitan and rural areas within Texas.

We began delivering electricity to customers in mid-February 2012.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Three Months ended September 30, 2015

Revenue     For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we generated $28,060,468 in electricity revenue primarily from commercial customers, and from various long and short-term residential customers.  The majority of our revenue comes from the flow of electricity to customers which includes revenues from contract cancellation fees, disconnection fees and late fees of $1,021,738.  Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $25,551,126 from electricity revenue which includes $2,148,215 from disconnection and late fees.

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit     For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, cost of goods sold and gross profit totaled $24,010,610 and $4,049,858, respectively.  Cost of goods sold and gross profit recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $20,446,346 and $5,104,780, respectively.

Operating expenses       Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 totaled $3,574,276 consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses of $2,067,999, stock compensation of $2,407, bank service fees of $183,338, professional fees of $47,434, outside commissions of $1,027,574 and $245,524 of billing fees.  Billing fees are primarily costs paid to third party Electronic Data Inter-Chain (EDI) provider to handle transactions between us, ERCOT and the TDSPs in order to produce customer bills.

Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 totaled $3,106,175, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses of $1,858,717, stock compensation of $61,431, bank service fees of $152,953, professional fees of $38,136, outside commissions of $748,337 and $246,601 of billing fees.

14 

The three months ended September 2016 compared to the three months ended September 2015 reflect a lower profit margin which is a result of compressed unit margin caused by the competitive pressures in the marketplace and the customer base for the Company has shifted towards a greater number of commercial accounts than residential accounts which yield lower unit margins.  In addition, weather significantly impacts our residential and small commercial customers and heating and cooling degree days can be used to evaluate the effect of weather on energy usage.  During the three months ended September 2016, revenues were negatively impacted by milder weather during August 2016 when compared to the three months ended September 2015.

Management plans to continue to execute on its sales and marketing program to solicit individual commercial as well as residential customers.   Management also plans to continue to acquire portfolios of commercial and residential customers when offered at reasonable prices.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015

Management plans to continue to execute on its sales and marketing program to solicit individual commercial as well as residential customers.   Management also plans to continue to acquire portfolios of commercial and residential customers when offered at reasonable prices.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our cash totaled $3,293,505 and $382,490, respectively.  Our principal cash requirements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, were for operating expenses and cost of goods sold (including power purchases, employee cost, and customer acquisition), collateral for TDSPs and capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the primary source of cash was from electricity revenues, $4,228,450 of capital raised pursuant to private placements of common stock and $2,500,000 in financing.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the primary source of cash was from electricity revenues. $130,000 of capital raised pursuant to private placements of common stock and warrants and $3,100,000 in financing.

General     The Company's increase in net cash flow during the first nine months of 2016 is attributable to $1,035,158 cash provided by operating activities, $1,497,339, cash used in investing activities which includes $70,214 for the purchase of property and equipment and $3,373,196 provided by financing activity.  In 2015, the Company's net cash decrease resulted from cash used by operations of $2,080,849, net cash used in investing activities of $269,859 which includes $91,344 for the purchase of property and equipment and $2,345,551 provided by financing activity.

The Company has no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in products, technologies, or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  If we are able to obtain additional financing, such financing may result in restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or substantial dilution for stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Cash Outflows for Capital Assets, Customer Acquisition and Deposits

We expect to expend funds for   capital assets, customer acquisition and deposits in connection with the expansion of our business during the remainder of the current fiscal year.  The anticipated source of funds will be cash on hand and the capital raised through the year ended December 31, 2016.

Future Financing Needs

The Company did not commence operations and the generation of revenue until the middle of the three month period ended March 31, 2012.  Our cash position may not be significant enough to support daily operations.  Management believes that we have adequate liquidity to support operations during the short-term, but this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks.

While we believe in the viability of our plan of operations and strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to obtain additional funds, there can be no assurances that our plan of operations or ability to raise capital will be successful.  The ability to grow is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan, generate revenues, and obtain additional financing, as needed.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our existing wholesale power purchase agreement provides that we will provide additional credit support to cover mark-to-market risk in connection with the purchase of long term power.  A mark-to-market credit risk occurs when the price of previously purchased long term power is greater than the current market price for power purchased for the same term.  While we believe that the current environment of historically low power prices limits our exposure to risk, a collateral call, should it occur, could limit our working capital and, if we fail to meet the collateral call, could cause liquidation of power positions.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the period of time covered by this Quarterly Report has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

The Risk Factors set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Any of the risks described in the 2015 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made.  These are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On September 9, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an investor for such investor to purchase from the Company 21,818 shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $24,000.

The Company intends to use the proceeds from this investment for general corporate and working capital purposes.

The common stock was offered to the investors in reliance upon an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  

Our reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act was based in part upon written representations made by each investor that: (a) the investor is acquiring the securities for his, her or its own account for investment and not for the account of any other person and not with a view to or for distribution, assignment or resale in connection with any distribution within the meaning of the Securities Act, (b) the investor agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer the securities unless they are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an exemption from such registration is available, (c) the investor has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that he, she or it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Company, (d) the investor had access to all of our documents, records, and books pertaining to the investment and was provided the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers regarding the terms and conditions of the offering or issuance and to obtain any additional information which we possessed or were able to acquire without unreasonable effort and expense, and (e) the investor has no need for liquidity in its investment and could afford the complete loss of such investment.  In our reliance upon Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, management made the determination, based upon written representations, that such investor was an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D. In addition, there was no general solicitation or advertising for securities issued in reliance upon Regulation D.

Our reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 was based in part upon the following factors: (a) the issuance of the securities was in connection with isolated private transactions which did not involve any public offering; (b) there were a limited number of offerees; (c) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the securities by us; (d) the securities were not broken down into smaller denominations; and (e) the negotiations for the sale of the securities took place directly between the offeree and the Company.
