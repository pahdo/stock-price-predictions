     Table of Contents           RENOVACARE, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        Note 1. Organization, Nature and Continuance of Operations      RenovaCare, Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiary (the "Company"), focuses on the acquisition, research, development and, if warranted, commercialization of autologous (using a patient's own cells) cellular therapies that can be used for medical and aesthetic applications.      On July 12, 2013, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences Corp. ("RenovaCare Sciences"), completed the acquisition of its flagship technologies (collectively, the "CellMist  System") along with the associated United States patent applications and two foreign patents, the first of which expires on August 22, 2027 and the second of which expires on April 26, 2031. The Cell Mist  System is comprised of (a) a treatment methodology for cell isolation for the regeneration of human skin cells (the "CellMist  Solution") and (b) a solution sprayer device (the "SkinGun ") for delivering the cells to the treatment area. The solution sprayer device also is a medical-grade liquid spraying device for general use in wound care and irrigation. Based on these technologies the Company has recently filed two additional patent applications, one with the United States Patent and Trademark Office titled "Modular Device for Cell Spraying" and one with the European Patent Office titled "Disposable Apparatus and Device with Unsterile Reusable Apparatus for Sterile Application of a Liquid."     The Company has recently incurred net operating losses and operating cash flow deficits. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's accumulated deficit is $10,584,575. The Company does not currently generate revenues and will continue to incur losses from operations and operating cash flow deficits in the future. Management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalent balances and other external sources of capital will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through January 2017. The future of the Company after January 2017 will depend on its ability to successfully raise capital from external sources to fund operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate funds, or if such funds are not available to it on acceptable terms, the Company's ability to continue its business as planned will be significantly impaired and it may cause the Company to curtail operations.       Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies       Basis of Presentation and Principles of Accounting      The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to Part 210 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures included are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.     In management's opinion, the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the Company's prior audited consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated information about subsequent events that became available to us through the date the financial statements were issued. This information relates to events, transactions or changes in circumstances that would require us to adjust the amounts reported in the financial statements or to disclose information about those events, transactions or changes in circumstances. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements, including the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, which may be found under the Company's profile on EDGAR.                 7       
     Table of Contents           Principles of Consolidation      These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. RenovaCare Sciences was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 12, 2013.      Applicable Accounting Guidance      Any reference in these notes to applicable accounting guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative non-governmental US GAAP as found in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification.     In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-19, Stock Compensation, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this ASU.      In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which supersedes ASC Topic 840, Leases, and creates a new topic, ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will currently have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 to further clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will currently have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.     The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of the Company s previous fiscal year may be applicable, the Company has not identified any standards that the Company believes merit further discussion other than as discussed above. The Company believes that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on the financial statements.      Accounting Estimates      The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results, as determined by future events, may differ from these estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents may at times exceed federally insured limits.                 8       
     Table of Contents          Fair Value Measurement      The Company measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The Company utilizes a three-tier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:     Level 1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access. The Company has no assets or liabilities valued with Level 1 inputs.     Level 2. Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The Company has no assets or liabilities valued with Level 2 inputs.     Level 3. Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company has no assets or liabilities valued with Level 3 inputs.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, contract and contribution, note payable and interest payable approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments and their liquidity. It is not practical to determine the fair value of the Company s note payable due to the complex terms. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.      Research and Development Costs      The Company intends to outsource its research and development efforts and expense related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials. The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired will be capitalized as it relates to particular research and development projects that may have alternative future uses.      Intangible Assets      The Company s intangible asset consists primarily of the CellMist TM  System technology that the Company acquired during 2013 and is recorded at cost. At the time of acquisition, the technology had not reached technological feasibility. The amount capitalized is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment. Upon successful completion, a determination will be made as to the then useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. The Company tests the intangible asset for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist after performing a qualitative analysis. Management has multiple criteria that it considers when performing the qualitative analysis. The results of this review are then weighed and prioritized. If the totality of the relevant events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset is not impaired, additional impairment tests are not necessary.     The Company assessed the following qualitative factors that could affect any change in the fair value of the intangible asset: analysis of the technology's current phase, additional testing necessary to bring the technology to market, development of competing products, changes in projections caused by delays, changes in regulations, changes in the market for the technology and changes in cost projections to bring the technology to market. Based on a qualitative assessment, management concluded that a positive assertion can be made from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset related to the CellMist TM  System is not impaired. The Company did, however, determine that an intangible asset related to wound care technology, acquired during 2013, was impaired during the period ended March 31, 2015 and recorded an impairment loss (a component of research and development expenses) amounting to $10,000 which was equal to the amount capitalized.                 9       
     Table of Contents          Stock Options      The Company measures all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method on the date of grant and recognizes such expense in its consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires management to make assumptions regarding option lives, expected volatility, and risk free interest rates.      Income Taxes      The Company recognizes income taxes on an accrual basis based on tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns. A tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical merits, that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability-weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if all, or some portion, of such assets will more than likely not be realized. Should they occur, the Company's policy is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as interest expense. Since the Company's inception, no such interest or penalties have been incurred. The Company did not record an income tax provision during the periods presented due to net taxable losses.      Earnings (Loss) Per Share      The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period presented. The Company has not included the effects of warrants, stock options and convertible debt on net loss per share because to do so would be antidilutive.     Following is the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:                   Related Party Transactions      A related party is generally defined as (i) any person who holds 10% or more of the Company's securities and their immediate families; (ii) the Company's management; (iii) someone who directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company; or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. See  Note 7. Related Party Transactions,  for further discussion.            Note 3. Debt      On September 9, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Kalen Capital Corporation ( KCC ); KCC is wholly owned by Mr. Harmel S. Rayat, the Company's majority shareholder. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, KCC agreed to loan the Company up to $900,000 at an annual interest rate of 7% per year, compounded quarterly. KCC provided the Company with an initial loan in the amount of $700,000, which was evidenced by a convertible promissory note (the  Note ); the remaining $200,000 may be loaned prior to December 31, 2017, upon the mutual agreement of the Company and KCC. The Note, including any interest due thereon, may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The Note matures on December 31, 2017, and, beginning on the first anniversary of the Note, can be converted, at KCC s sole discretion, into shares of the Company s common stock at conversion rate equal to the lesser of: (i) $1.54, or the closing price of the Company s common stock on the day prior to the issuance of the Note or (ii) a 20% discount to the average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five days prior to the date on which KCC elects to convert the Note.     Per the Loan Agreement, the Company issued KCC a Series E Stock Purchase Warrant (the  Series E Warrant ) to purchase up to 584,416 shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of the lesser of: (i) $1.54, the closing price of the Company s common stock on the day prior to issuance of the Series E Warrant; or (ii) a 20% discount to the average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five days prior to the date on which KCC elects to exercise the Series E Warrant. The Series E Warrant is exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance and may be exercised on a cashless basis.     The Loan Agreement provides KCC with registration rights for all of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Note, including conversion of the note issued for the remaining $200,000, if applicable, and exercise of the Series E Warrant, beginning on the first anniversary of the Loan Agreement.     The Company calculated the debt discount related to the Note and Series E Warrant by first allocating the respective fair value of the Note and Series E Warrant based upon their relative fair values to the total Note proceeds. The fair value of the Series E Warrant issued with the Note was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: exercise price - $1.25 per share; market price of common stock - $1.54 per share; estimated volatility   92.3%; risk free interest rate - 1.23%; expected dividend rate - 0% and expected life - 5.0 years. The resulting fair value of $340,735 was allocated to the Series E Warrant. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature amounted to $359,265. The resulting $700,000 discount to the Note is being accreted over the 1.25 year term of the Note.     During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $2,819 of interest expense and $30,753 of accretion related to the debt discount. The remaining debt discount of $669,247 will be amortized over the next five quarters through December 31, 2017.      Note 4. Common Stock Options       2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan      On June 20, 2013, the Board of Directors (the "Board") adopted, subject to receiving shareholder approval, the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of stock options of up to 20,000,000 shares (subject to adjustment) of the Company's common stock to officers, directors, key employees and consultants of the Company. Options granted to employees under the Incentive Plan, including directors and officers who are employees, may be incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options; options granted to others under the Incentive Plan are limited to non-qualified stock options. On November 15, 2013, shareholders owning a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding shares approved the Incentive Plan.     The Incentive Plan is administered by the Board or a committee designated by the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Incentive Plan, the Board has the authority to determine the officers, employees and consultants to whom options will be granted, the number of shares covered by each option, vesting rights and the terms and conditions of each option that is granted to them; however, no person may be granted in any of the Company's fiscal year, options to purchase more than 2,000,000 shares under the Incentive Plan, and the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year cannot exceed $100,000. Options granted pursuant to the Incentive Plan are exercisable no later than ten years after the date of grant.            The exercise price per share of common stock for options granted under the Incentive Plan will be the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day prior to the date of grant, except for incentive stock options granted to a holder of ten percent or more of the Company's common stock, for whom the exercise price per share will not be less than 110% of the fair market value. No option can be granted under the Incentive Plan after June 20, 2023.     As of September 30, 2016, there were 19,555,000 shares available for grant.      Stock Option Activity      The following table summarizes stock option activity for the period ended September 30, 2016:           The fair value of each stock option is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There were 187,500 stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $1.41. There were 15,000 stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $1.08. Assumptions regarding volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate are required for the Black-Scholes model. The volatility assumption is based on the Company's historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. treasury note with maturity similar to the option award's expected life. The expected life represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The assumptions for volatility, expected life, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate for options granted are presented in the table below:           The fair value of our stock options is expensed ratably over their respective vesting periods. The following table sets forth the share-based compensation cost resulting from stock option grants, including those previously granted and vesting over time, that were recorded in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:           Stock-based compensation expense is recognized as general and administrative expenses.

Subsequent Events      Management has reviewed material events subsequent of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 and prior to the filing of financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC 855  Subsequent Events  and has determined there are no events to report.              Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements       You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.      This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Critical accounting policies, the policies us believes are most important to the presentation of its financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are outlined below in "Critical Accounting Policies," and have not changed significantly.      Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements      This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as well as information relating to RenovaCare, Inc. and its subsidiaries that is based on management's exercise of business judgment and assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Although forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements. When used in this document and other documents, releases and reports released by us, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "the facts suggest" and words of similar import, are intended to identify any forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current view of future events and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as noted below. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Actual events, transactions and results may materially differ from the anticipated events, transactions or results described in such statements. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will materialize. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements and unknown, unidentified or unpredictable factors could materially and adversely impact our future results. We undertake no obligation and do not intend to update, revise or otherwise publicly release any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events. Several of these factors include, without limitation:                      our ability to meet requisite regulations or receive regulatory approvals in the United States, and our ability to retain any regulatory approvals that we may obtain; and the absence of adverse regulatory developments in the United States and abroad;               new entrance of competitive products or further penetration of existing products in our markets;               the effect on us from adverse publicity related to our products or the company itself; and               any adverse claims relating to our intellectual property.

In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur.            Overview      RenovaCare, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiary, " RenovaCare " the " Company " " we " " us " or " our ") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada and has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value common stock, of which 69,955,847 shares are outstanding as of the date of this report, and 10,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock, of which none are outstanding.     On January 7, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation changing our name from "Janus Resources, Inc." to "RenovaCare, Inc." so as to more fully reflect our operations. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority declared the name change effective as of January 9, 2014. In conjunction with the name change, we changed our stock symbol on the OTCQB from "JANI" to "RCAR".     Our principal executive offices are located at 430 Park Avenue, Suite 702, New York, NY 10022. Our telephone number is (888) 398-0202.     As we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make certain disclosures otherwise required to be made in a Form 10-Q.      Description of Business      We are focusing on the acquisition, research, development and, if warranted, commercialization of autologous (using a patient's own cells) cellular therapies that can be used for medical and aesthetic applications. On July 12, 2013, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences Corp., completed the acquisition of our flagship technologies (collectively, the " CellMist  System ") along with the associated United States patent applications and two (2) foreign patents, the first of which expires on August 22, 2027 and the second of which expires on April 26, 2031. The Cell Mist  System is comprised of (i) a treatment methodology for cell isolation for the regeneration of human skin cells (the " CellMist  Solution ") and (ii) a solution sprayer device (the " SkinGun  ") for delivering the cells to the treatment area. The solution sprayer device also is a medical-grade liquid spraying device for general use in wound care and irrigation. We effected the acquisition of the CellMist TM  System through an asset purchase agreement with Dr. Gerlach (the " APA "). Pursuant to the terms of the APA, as amended on September 9, 2014, we paid Dr. Gerlach an initial sum of $100,000 and are obligated to pay him an additional $300,000 in four installments: (a) $100,000 on December 31, 2014; (b) $50,000 on December 31, 2015; (c) $50,000 on December 31, 2016; and (d) $100,000 on December 31, 2017. Additionally, we issued to Dr. Gerlach a Series A Warrant allowing him to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share through July 12, 2019; the warrant vests in five equal annual installments.     The average adult human has a skin surface area of between 16 - 21 square feet, which protects all other organs against the external environment. When a person's skin is assailed by trauma or exposed to extreme heat, the skin's various layers may be destroyed and, depending on the severity of the injury, might cause life-threatening conditions. Currently, severe trauma to the skin, such as second or third degree burns, requires surgical mesh-grafting of skin, whereby healthy skin is removed from one area of the patient's body (a " donor site ") and implanted on the damaged area. While mesh grafting is often the method of choice, we believe there are significant deficiencies with this method. The surgical procedure to remove healthy skin from the donor site can be painful and leaves the patient with a new wound that must also be attended to. In many instances the aesthetic results are not satisfying, as the color of the skin from the donor site may not match the skin color of the damaged skin. Additionally, since the ratio between the size of the wound area and the size of the donor site is quite low, i.e. the size of the skin removed must be substantially equal in size to the size of the damaged skin, the mesh-grafting approach is in many cases limited. Donor and injury sites can take weeks to heal, requiring expensive hospital stays, ongoing wound dressing management, and ever-changing anti-infection strategies. We are currently evaluating the efficacy and potential of our SkinGun TM , in combination with our CellMist  Solution, in the treatment of tissue that has been subject to severe trauma such as second and third degree burns. In small scale clinical trials, the SkinGun TM  and cell isolation methodology have shown the ability to regenerate a more natural and thicker skin. The CellMist TM  System utilizes the patient's own skin stem cells and is able to address much larger treatment areas and at the same time reduce the size of the donor site. Furthermore, we believe the CellMist TM  System enables the effective treatment of other skin disorders with minimal scarring compared to skin grafting.            In a clinical study of 19 patients with deep dermal wound burns to the face and neck conducted in Berlin, Germany prior to our purchase of the CellMist  System, researchers stated that, "careful surgical debridement and consecutive application of CEA [cultured epithelial auto graft] suspensions using a spray technique results in excellent cosmetic outcomes compared with any other method." The same researchers concluded that, "We refuse to perform a prospective randomized study with groups in which traditional skin grafting and/or wound healing are still applied for the therapy for deep dermal burns due to the excellent results in our study.   The method of CEA spray application has become our standard of care for these indications. The faster wound closure, the promotion of spontaneous wound healing by keratinocyte application, as well as the preservation of donor sites are further advantages of the method  ." (Hartmann MD, Bernd, et al, "Sprayed Cultured Epithelial Autografts for Deep Dermal Burns of the Face and Neck"  Annals of Plastic Surgery , 58.1(2007): 70-73. Print.   emphasis added  ). The CEA spray application used by the researchers in the publication refers to earlier iterations of what is now CellMist TM  System . Dr. Gerlach, from whom we purchased the CellMist TM  System, assisted in the study.     The development of our CellMist  System is in the early stage and we anticipate that we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further develop our technology and determine whether a commercially viable product can be developed. Research and development of new technologies involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that our development activities will result in a commercially viable product. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.      Strategy      Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our SkinGun TM , together with our CellMist  Solution, as cutting edge treatments in skin therapy. Before we can do so, however, there are a number of steps we must first take, including:                      initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the CellMist  System's efficacy for treating wounds and burns;               formalizing collaborations with universities and scientific partners;               creating a network of clinical and research partners; and               achieving Food and Drug Administration (the " FDA ") and other regulatory approval.         Additionally, we will likely be required to raise significant capital in order to fund our ongoing research and development operations, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, if at all.             Results of Operations        Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Operating Expenses      A summary of our operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows:                    Research and Development       Research and development (  R D  ) costs represent costs incurred to develop our CellMist TM  System and are incurred pursuant to agreements with third party providers. R D costs are expensed when incurred. R D costs decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of the timing of certain of our R D expenses, which we expect will increase in the fourth quarter. R D costs increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of increased expenditures made in anticipation of our FDA and other regulatory filings.       General and Administrative       General and administrative costs include all expenditures incurred other than research and development related costs, including costs related to personnel, professional fees, travel and entertainment, public company costs, insurance and other office related costs. Costs increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an investor outreach and branding program, increase in legal fees related to the drafting of a master clinical trial agreement and higher personnel costs.            Other Income (Expense)      Other income and expense primarily relates to a convertible promissory note dated September 9, 2016 with a face amount of $700,000. Interest expense relates to the stated interest of the convertible promissory note. Accretion of debt discount represents the accretion of the discount applied to the note as a result of the issuance of detachable warrants and the beneficial conversion feature contained in the note.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       We currently finance our activities through the sale of our equity securities and issuance of debt. There is no assurance that funding will be accessible to us at the times and in the amounts required to fund our ongoing operations. There are many conditions beyond our control, which have a direct bearing on the level of investor interest in the purchase of our securities.     We do not have any agreements or understandings with any person as to additional financing.     At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $687,747 (December 2015: $397,589) and working capital of $582,029 (December 2015: $172,099). Total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $251,320 (December 2015: $335,783).     Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception of $10.6 million. We require additional funds to meet our obligations and maintain our operations. We have sufficient working capital to (i) pay our administrative and general operating expenses through January 31, 2017, and (ii) to conduct our preliminary research and development programs. We do not currently have cash flow from operations as we have no commercialized products; without cash flow from operations, we will need to obtain additional funds (presumably through equity offerings and/or debt borrowing) in order to implement our current research and development programs for the CellMist TM  System. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds, or if such funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, our ability to continue our business as planned will be significantly impaired and it may cause us to curtail operations.     Net cash used in operating activities was $1,409,842 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $787,206 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,700,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,010,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     On September 9, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement with KCC whereby KCC agreed to loan us up to $900,000 with an initial loan in the amount of $700,000. On February 2, 2016, KCC exercised a portion of its Series B Warrant for 2,173,913 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.46 per share resulting in proceeds of $1,000,000.     On June 5, 2015, we entered into subscription agreements with five investors for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 1,010,000 units of our equity securities at a price of $1.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $1,010,000. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one Series D Warrant allowing the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $1.10 per share for a period of five years; we used the proceeds from the sale of the units for research and development and general corporate purposes.      Dividends      We have neither declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our earnings to finance growth and expand our operations and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.            Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Risks      Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value.     The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, contract and contribution payable, accounts payable, note payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.     Management is of the opinion that we are not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.      Market Risk Disclosures      We have not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes during or subsequent to the periods presented.      Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or contractual obligations at September 30, 2016, and the subsequent period to through the date of this report, that are likely to have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that have not been disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.      Critical Accounting Policies      See " Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.      Related Party Transactions      Our proposed business raises potential conflicts of interests between certain of our officers and directors and us. Certain of our directors are employees or consultants to other companies in the healthcare industry and, to the extent that such other companies may participate in ventures in which we may participate, our directors may have a conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding terms regarding the extent of such participation. In the event that such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or against the approval of such participation or such terms. Other than as indicated, we have no other procedures or mechanisms to deal with conflicts of interest. We are not aware of the existence of any conflict of interest as described herein.     Other than as disclosed below, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the subsequent period, none of our current directors, officers or principal shareholders, nor any family member of the foregoing, nor, to the best of our information and belief, any of our former directors, senior officers or principal shareholders, nor any family member of such former directors, officers or principal shareholders, has or had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or in any proposed transaction which has materially affected or will materially affect us.     As compensation for their service on the Board, Dr. Kirkland and Mr. Sierchio receive an annual retainer of $6,000, payable in equal yearly installments in arrears and prorated for any partial years of service. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, directors' and consulting fees with respect to our officers and directors were $3,000 (2015: $3,000) and $9,000 (2015: $9,000). Legal fees incurred with respect to one of our directors in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $30,080 (2015: $20,583) and $121,595 (2015: $83,138), respectively. Amounts included in accrued expenses   related parties were $30,080 at September 30, 2016 and $30,095 as of December 31, 2015.           In connection with our anticipated FDA and other regulatory filings, we engaged StemCell Systems to provide us with prototypes and related documents for our CellMist TM  System. Pursuant to this engagement we incurred expenses of $24,000 and $80,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $134,567 and $140,627 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Dr. Gerlach, from whom we purchased the CellMist  System, is a principal of StemCell Systems.     On September 9, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement (the   Loan Agreement  ) with Kalen Capital Corporation (  KCC  ), a private corporation that is wholly owned by Mr. Harmel S. Rayat, our majority shareholder. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, KCC agreed to loan us up to $900,000 at an annual interest rate of 7% per year, compounded quarterly. KCC provided us with an initial loan in the amount of $700,000, which was evidenced by the Note; the remaining $200,000 may be loaned prior to December 31, 2017, upon the mutual agreement of the Company and KCC.
