2.   
       Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies     

(a)      Basis of Presentation   

Basis of Presentation   The accompanying
condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The details of
subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 1. Significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
The condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions in Article
10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles
for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and related footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of the Company s management, contain all necessary adjustments, which
include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for
the interim periods presented. 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the Company s audited financial statements at that date but does not include all
of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the Company s management believes that the
disclosures contained in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading. For further
information, please refer to the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The results of operations for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for
the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 

Estimation - The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Foreign Currencies - China Automotive,
the parent company, and HLUSA maintain their books and records in United States Dollars,  USD,  their functional currency.
The Company s subsidiaries based in the PRC and Genesis maintain their books and records in Renminbi,  RMB, 
their functional currency. The Company s subsidiary based in Brazil maintains its books and records in Brazilian reais,  BRL, 
its functional currency. In accordance with ASC Topic 830,  FASB Accounting Standards Codification , foreign currency
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at the rate
of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date for monetary items. Nonmonetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Income
and expenses are remeasured at the rate in effect on the transaction dates. Transaction gains and losses, if any, are included
in the determination of net income for the period.  

(b)      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued ASU No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was further
updated by ASU No. 2016-08 in March 2016, ASU No.2016-10 in April 2016 and ASU No.2016-11 in May 2016. The new guidance clarifies
the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods and services. In July 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the ASU effective date from annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which eliminates
the probable recognition threshold for credit impairments. The new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider
in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually to include forecasted information,
as well as past events and current conditions. There is no specified method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity
is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. This ASU is effective for the
Company on December 15, 2019. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU was issued
as part of the FASB Simplification Initiative and involves several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity
in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected
as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of
the amendments in the same period. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 refines how
companies classify certain aspects of the cash flow statement in regards to debt prepayment, settlement of debt instruments, contingent
consideration payments, proceeds from insurance claims and life insurance policies, distribution from equity method investees,
beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

       Deferred income tax assets     

In accordance with the provisions of  ASC
Topic 740,  Income Taxes ,  the Company assesses, on a quarterly basis, its ability to realize its deferred tax
assets. Based on the more likely than not standard in the guidance and the weight of available evidence, the Company believes a
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets is necessary. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company
considered the following significant factors: an assessment of recent years  profitability and losses by tax authorities;
the Company s expectation of profits based on margins and volumes expected to be realized, which are based on current pricing
and volume trends; the long period in all significant operating jurisdictions before the expiry of net operating losses, noting
further that a portion of the deferred tax asset is composed of deductible temporary differences that are subject to an expiry
period until realized under tax law. The Company will continue to evaluate the provision of valuation allowance in future periods. 

The components of estimated deferred income tax assets as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (figures are in thousands of USD): 

(1)  
      The net operating losses carry forward for the U.S. entities for income tax purposes are available to reduce future years' taxable income. These losses will expire, if not utilized, in 20 years. Net operating losses carry forward for China entities can be carried forward for 5 years to offset taxable income. However, as of September 30, 2016, the valuation allowance was $10.1 million, including $7.6 million allowance for the Company s deferred tax assets in the United States and $2.5 million allowance for the Company s non-U.S. deferred tax assets in China. Based on the Company s current operations in the United States, management believes that the deferred tax assets in the United States are not likely to be realized in the future. For the deferred tax assets in other countries, pursuant to certain tax laws and regulations, management believes such amount will not be used to offset future taxable income.   

(2)  
      Approximately $4.9 million and $4.9 million of net deferred income tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are included in non-current deferred tax assets in the accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated balance sheets.

      On December 11, 2015, the Company granted 22,500 stock options to the Company s independent directors, with the exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock traded on NASDAQ on the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option model requires management to make various estimates and assumptions, including expected term, expected volatility, risk-free rate and dividend yield. The expected term represents the period of time that stock-based compensation awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on considerations including the vesting period, contractual term and anticipated employee exercise patterns. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in relation to the contractual life of stock-based compensation instruments. The dividend yield assumption is based on historical patterns and future expectations for the Company s dividends.   

Assumptions used to estimate the fair value
of the stock options on the grant dates are as follows: 

The above stock options were vested and
exercisable immediately. Their fair value on the grant date of  December 11, 2015  using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $0.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized stock-based
compensation expenses of $0.1 million.

Pursuant to the New China Income Tax Law
and the Implementing Rules,  New CIT , which became effective as of January 1, 2008, dividends generated after January
1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax if the foreign
investors are considered non-resident enterprises without any establishment or place within China or if the dividends payable have
no connection with the establishment or place of the foreign investors within China, unless any such foreign investor s jurisdiction
of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. 

Genesis, the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary and the direct holder of the equity interests in the Company s subsidiaries in China, is incorporated in Hong
Kong. According to the Mainland China and Hong Kong Taxation Arrangement, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in China
to its direct holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5%, if the foreign investor
directly owns at least 25% of the shares of the foreign-invested enterprise. Under the New CIT, if Genesis is regarded as a non-resident
enterprise, it is required to pay an additional 5% withholding tax for any dividends payable to it from the PRC subsidiaries. 

According to PRC tax regulation, the Company
should withhold income taxes for the profits distributed from the PRC subsidiaries to Genesis, the subsidiaries  holding
company incorporated in Hong Kong. For the profits that the PRC subsidiaries intended to distribute to Genesis, the Company accrues
the withholding income tax as deferred tax liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized deferred tax liabilities
of $0.2 million for the remaining undistributed profits to Genesis of $4.2 million. The Company intended to re-invest the remaining
undistributed profits generated from the PRC subsidiaries in those subsidiaries permanently. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company still has undistributed earnings of approximately $240.6 million and $228.7 million, respectively, from investment
in the PRC subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. Had the undistributed earnings been distributed to Genesis
and not permanently reinvested, the tax provision as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of approximately $12.0 million
and $11.4 million, respectively, would have been recorded. Such undistributed profits will be reinvested in Genesis and not further
distributed to the parent company incorporated in the United States going forward.

Basic income per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding during the
period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is determined based on the treasury stock method.

stock options were excluded from the calculation of the diluted income per share for the corresponding periods presented. 

27.   
       Significant concentrations     

A significant portion of the Company s
business is conducted in China where the currency is the RMB. Regulations in China permit foreign owned entities to freely convert
the RMB into foreign currency for transactions that fall under the  current account,  which includes trade related receipts
and payments, interest and dividends. Accordingly, the Company s Chinese subsidiaries may use RMB to purchase foreign exchange
for settlement of such  current account  transactions without pre-approval. However, pursuant to applicable regulations,
foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance
with the PRC law. In calculating accumulated profits, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least
10% of their annual net income each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, including mandated employee benefits funds, unless
these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. 

Transactions other than those that fall
under the  current account  and that involve conversion of RMB into foreign currency are classified as  capital
account  transactions; examples of  capital account  transactions include repatriations of investment by or loans
to foreign owners, or direct equity investments in a foreign entity by a China domiciled entity.  Capital account  transactions
require prior approval from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its provincial branch to convert a remittance
into a foreign currency, such as USD, and transmit the foreign currency outside of China. 

This system could be changed at any time
and any such change may affect the ability of the Company or its subsidiaries in China to repatriate capital or profits, if any,
outside China. Furthermore, SAFE has a significant degree of administrative discretion in implementing the laws and has used this
discretion to limit convertibility of current account payments out of China. Whether as a result of a deterioration in the Chinese
balance of payments, a shift in the Chinese macroeconomic prospects or any number of other reasons, China could impose additional
restrictions on capital remittances abroad. As a result of these and other restrictions under the laws and regulations of the PRC,
the Company s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the parent. The
Company has no assurance that the relevant Chinese governmental authorities in the future will not limit further or eliminate the
ability of the Company s PRC subsidiaries to purchase foreign currencies and transfer such funds to the Company to meet its
liquidity or other business needs. Any inability to access funds in China, if and when needed for use by the Company outside of
China, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and its business. 

The Company grants credit to its customers
including Xiamen Joylon, Xiamen Automotive Parts, Shanghai Fenglong and Jingzhou Yude, which are related parties of the Company.
The Company s customers are mostly located in the PRC. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s ten largest customers accounted for 62.7% of its consolidated net product sales, with one customer
individually accounting for more than 10% of consolidated net sales i.e., 12.9%. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 3.8% of
accounts receivable were from trade transactions with the aforementioned customer. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company s ten largest customers accounted for 69.6% of its consolidated net product sales, with one customer
individually accounting for more than 10% of consolidated net sales, i.e., 13.4%. As of September 30, 2015, approximately 6.9%
of accounts receivable were from trade transactions with the aforementioned customer, and there was no individual customer with
a receivables balance of more than 10% of total accounts receivable.

       Commitments and contingencies    

Legal proceedings  

The Company is not a party to any pending
or, to the best of the Company s knowledge, any threatened legal proceedings. In addition, no director, officer or affiliate

(1)  
      On September 22, 2014, Hubei Henglong entered into an agreement with other parties to establish the Venture Fund, under which Hubei Henglong has committed to make investments of RMB 50.0 million, equivalent to approximately $7.6 million, into the Venture Fund in three installments. As of September 30, 2016, Hubei Henglong has completed a capital contribution of RMB 35.0 million, equivalent to approximately $5.3 million, representing 14.7% of the Venture Fund s shares. According to the agreement, the remaining capital commitment of RMB 15.0 million, equivalent to approximately $2.3 million, will be paid upon capital calls received from the Venture Fund.   
 
      (2)  
      In May 2016, Hubei Henglong entered into an agreement with other parties to establish a venture capital fund, the  Chongqing Venture Fund . Hubei Henglong has committed to make investments of RMB 120.0 million, equivalent to approximately $18.0 million, representing 17.1% of Chongqing Venture Fund s shares. The capital contribution will be paid in three installments. As of September 30, 2016, Hubei Henglong has completed a capital contribution of RMB 38.0 million, equivalent to approximately $5.7 million. The remaining capital contribution will be made in installments from 2016 to 2018.   

30.   
       Off-balance sheet arrangements    

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company did not have any significant transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

The accounting policies of the product
sectors are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the disaggregated financial
results for the product sectors have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in
which management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting them in making internal operating
decisions. Generally, the Company evaluates performance based on stand-alone product sector operating income and accounts for inter
segment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, at current market prices. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
11 product sectors, five of which were principal profit makers and were reported as separate sectors and engaged in the production
and sales of power steering (Henglong, Jiulong, Shenyang, Wuhu and Hubei Henglong), and one holding company (Genesis). The other
six sectors were engaged in the production and sale of sensor modular (USAI), automobile steering columns (Jielong), provision
of after sales and R D services (HLUSA), production and sale of power steering (Chongqing Henglong), trade (Brazil Henglong),
and manufacture and sales of automobile electronic systems and parts (Wuhan Chuguanjie). Since the revenues, net income and net
assets of these six sectors collectively are less than 10% of consolidated revenues, net income and net assets, respectively, in
the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company incorporated these six sectors into  Other Sectors.  

As of September 30, 2015, the Company had
12 product sectors, five of which were principal profit makers and were reported as separate sectors and engaged in the production

seven sectors were engaged in the production and sale of sensor modular (USAI), automobile steering columns (Jielong), provision
of after sales and R D services (HLUSA), production and sale of power steering (Chongqing Henglong), trade (Brazil Henglong),
commercial vehicle repacking and sales (Fujian Qiaolong), and manufacture and sales of automobile electronic systems and parts
(Wuhan Chuguanjie). Since the revenues, net income and net assets of these seven sectors collectively are less than 10% of consolidated
revenues, net income and net assets, respectively, in the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company incorporated
these seven sectors into  Other Sectors.

ITEM 2.   
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto
and the other financial information contained elsewhere in this Report. 

General Overview   

China Automotive Systems, Inc. is a leading
power steering systems supplier for the China automobile industry. The Company has business relations with more than sixty vehicle
manufacturers, including JAC Motors, Changan Automobile Group, BAIC Group, SAIC Group and Dongfeng Auto Group, the five largest

steering gears to Chrysler North America since 2009. 

Most of the Company s production
and research and development institutes are located in China. The Company has approximately 3,000 employees dedicated to design,
development, manufacture and sales of its products. By leveraging its extensive experience, innovative technology and geographic
strengths, the Company aims to grow leading positions in automotive power steering systems and to further improve overall margins,
long-term operating profitability and cash flows. To achieve these goals and to respond to industry factors and trends, the Company
is continuing work to improve its operations and business structure and achieve profitable growth. 

Corporate Structure   

The Company, through its subsidiaries,
engages in the manufacture and sales of automotive systems and components. Great Genesis Holdings Limited, a company incorporated
in Hong Kong on January 3, 2003 under the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong as a limited liability company,  Genesis, 
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the holding company of the Company s joint ventures in the PRC. Henglong
USA Corporation,  HLUSA,  incorporated on January 8, 2007 in Troy, Michigan, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
and mainly engages in marketing of automotive parts in North America, and provides after-sales service and research and development
support. CAAS Brazil s Imports And Trade In Automotive Parts Ltd.,  Brazil Henglong,  was established by Hubei
Henglong Automotive System Group Co., Ltd., formerly known as Jingzhou Hengsheng Automotive System Co., Ltd.,   Hubei Henglong, 
as a Sino-foreign joint venture company with two Brazilian citizens in Brazil in August 2012. Fujian Qiaolong was acquired by the
Company in the second quarter of 2014, as a joint venture company that mainly manufactures and distributes drainage and rescue
vehicles with mass flow, drainage vehicles with vertical downhole operation, crawler-type mobile pump stations, high-altitude water
supply and discharge drainage vehicles, long-range control crawler-type mobile pump stations and other vehicles, which was disposed
of by the Company in the second quarter of 2016. 

Critical Accounting Estimates   

The Company prepares its condensed consolidated
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases
its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions. The following critical accounting
policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

The Company considers an accounting estimate
to be critical if: 

It requires the Company to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time it was making the estimate, and   

Changes in the estimate or different estimates that the Company could have selected would have had a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.   

The table below presents information about
the nature and rationale for the Company s critical accounting estimates:

      Assumptions/Approaches  
 Used  
       
      Key Factors   

Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities 

Warranty obligations 

Estimating warranty requires the Company to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold. OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties, which may impact the Company s exposure to these costs.  
       
      The Company bases its estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with its current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with its customers.    

OEM sourcing 
          OEM policy decisions regarding warranty claims 

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other long-term assets  

Valuation of long- lived assets and investments 

The Company is required from time to time to review the recoverability of certain of its assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various product lines.  
       
      The Company estimates cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments.   

Future production estimates 
          Customer preferences and decisions    

Inventory 

Write-down of inventory 

The Company is required from time to time to review the cashability of inventory based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including write-down of inventory for prices that are higher than market price and undesirable inventories.  
       
      The Company estimates cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments.  

Future production estimates  
          Customer preferences and decisions   

Deferred income taxes 

Recoverability of deferred tax assets 

The Company is required to estimate whether recoverability of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the related tax jurisdiction.  
       
      The Company uses historical and projected future operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry forward period, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.    

Tax law changes 
          Variances in future projected profitability, including
        by taxing entity 

Tax payable and deferred tax assets/liabilities 

Uncertain tax positions 

The Company is required to determine and assess all material positions, including all significant uncertain positions in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge under relevant tax statutes.    
       
      The Company applies a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition. For the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement.  

An allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions 
          The characterization of income or a decision to exclude
        reporting taxable income in a tax return 
          A decision to classify a transaction, entity, or other
        position in a tax return as tax exempt   

In addition, there are other items within the Company s
financial statements that require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed above, including provision of accounts
and notes receivable. Although not significant in recent years, changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a
significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations   

Results of Operations Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Net Product Sales   

Net product sales were $94.6 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $90.8 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $3.8
million, or 4.2%.  

The Company s net product sales
were affected by the change in the product mix. With more passenger vehicles assembling electric power steering systems (EPS),
the share of hydraulic power steering gears (HPS), the Company s traditional products, is shrinking. Net sales of traditional
steering products were $45.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44.7 million for the same period
in 2015, representing an increase of $0.6 million, or 1.3%. Net sales of EPS were $25.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $20.3 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $5.3 million, or 26.1%. As a percentage
of net sales, sales of EPS were 27.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2015. 

The depreciation of China s currency,
the RMB, against the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015 had a negative impact on
net sales as more than 80% of the Company s business is conducted in China. 

In summary, the Company had an increase
in sales volume leading to a sales increase of $8.1 million, an increase in average selling price of steering gears leading to
a sales increase of 1.8 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to
a sales decrease of $6.1 million. 

Further analysis by segment (before elimination)
is as follows: 

Net product sales for Henglong
were $57.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $53.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, representing an increase of $3.6 million, or 6.7%, which was mainly due to the increase in sales of EPS. An increase
in sales volume led to a sales increase of $4.5 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $2.6
million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $3.5 million.  

Net product sales for Jiulong
were $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $16.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, representing an increase of $1.6 million, or 9.9%. Jiulong is gradually shifting its strategy from focusing on sales
volume to focusing on high gross margin products and developing new markets such as exports. An increase in sales volume led to
a sales increase of $0.3 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $2.3 million, and the effect
of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $1.0 million.  

Net product sales for Shenyang
were $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2015, representing
an increase of $0.7 million, or 9.3%. Shenyang s products are mainly sold to Shenyang Brilliance Jinbei Co., Ltd.,  Brilliance
Jinbei , one of China s largest commercial car manufacturers. The sales of Shenyang are mainly impacted by the demand
of Brilliance Jinbei. An increase in sales volumes led to a sales increase of $2.7 million, a decrease in average selling price
led to a sales decrease of $1.5 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led
to a sales decrease of $0.5 million.  

Net product sales for Wuhu
were $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2015, representing
an increase of $1.2 million, or 30.8%. An increase in sales volumes led to a sales increase of $1.3 million, and the effect of
foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $0.1 million.  

Net product sales for Hubei
Henglong were $13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2015,
representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.7%. Hubei Henglong s products are mainly sold to Chrysler. An increase in
sales volumes led to a sales increase of $0.2 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $0.7 million,
and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $0.8 million.  

Net product sales for Other
Sectors were $11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2015,
representing an increase of $2.9 million, or 33.3%, primarily due to an increase in the sales of  Chuguanjie, which manufactures
electronic systems for EPS  for Henglong, which were eliminated in consolidation. 

Cost of Products Sold  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, the cost of products sold was $74.6 million, compared to $74.9 million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease
of $0.3 million, or 0.4%. The decrease in the cost of products sold was mainly due to the net effect of a net increase in sales
volumes which led to a cost of products sold increase of $6.9 million, a decrease in unit cost which led to a cost of products
sold decrease of $2.4 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar which led to a
cost of products sold decrease of $4.8 million. Further analysis is as follows: 

Cost of products sold for Henglong was $47.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $46.1 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $1.5 million, or 3.3%. An increase in sales volumes led to a cost of products sold increase of $4.2 million, an increase in unit cost led to a cost of products sold increase of $0.2 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a cost of products sold decrease of $2.9 million.   

Cost of products sold for Jiulong was $14.9 million for the
    three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $14.8 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of
    $0.1 million, or 0.1%. An increase in sales volume led to a cost of products sold increase of $0.3 million, an increase in
    unit cost led to a cost of products sold increase of $0.5 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB
    against the U.S. dollar led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.9 million.   

Cost of products sold for Shenyang was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.2 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $0.9 million, or 14.5%. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, which led to a cost of products sold increase of $2.4 million, a decrease in unit cost, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $1.1 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.4 million.   

Cost of products sold for Wuhu was $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.6 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $1.1 million, or 30.6%. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, which led to a cost of products sold increase of $1.2 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.1 million.   

Cost of products sold for Hubei Henglong was $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $10.8 million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4.6%. The decrease in cost of products sold was mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, which led to a cost of products sold increase of $0.5 million, a decrease in unit cost, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.3 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.7 million.   

Cost of products sold for Other Sectors was $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.8 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $2.8 million, or 41.2%, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of Jielong.   

Gross margin was 21.1% for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to 17.5% for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 3.6%, mainly due to increased sales and the
changes in the product mix in 2016. 

Gain/(Loss) on Other Sales  

Gain on other sales mainly consisted of
net amount retained from sales of materials, property, plant and equipment, land use rights, and scraps. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, gain on other sales amounted to nil as compared to gain on other sales of $0.9 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $0.9 million, mainly due to a decrease in gain on sales of materials. 

Selling Expenses  

Selling expenses were $3.8 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3.3 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of
$0.5 million, or 13.2%. The increase was mainly due to the increase in transportation expenses during that quarter since larger
volumes of products were shipped to customers. 

General and Administrative Expenses

years. 

The global automotive parts industry is

Net Income  

Net income was $5.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing
an increase of $1.5 million, or 34.1%, which was mainly due to an increase in income before income tax expenses and equity in earnings

Results of Operations Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Net Product Sales  

Net product sales were $312.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $323.5 million for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $11.0
million, or 3.4%. As a result of economic slowdown in China, the GDP growth rate was maintained at 6.7% in the first three quarters
of 2016, the lowest since 2009. As the major part of the Company s business is conducted in China, China s slow economy
led to decreased vehicle sales which correspondingly led to decreased sales volumes of the Company as an auto parts supplier. 

The change in product mix also caused a
decline in the Company s net product sales. With more passenger vehicles assembling electric power steering systems ( EPS ),
the share of hydraulic power steering gears ( HPS ), the Company s traditional products, is shrinking. Although
the Company s sales of EPS increased substantially, this increase is only partially offset by the decline in sales of HPS
due to the low percentage of EPS in the product mix. Net sales of traditional steering products were $151.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $181.8 million for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $30.8 million,
or 16.9%. Net sales of EPS were $85.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $66.8 million for the same
period in 2015, representing an increase of $18.9 million, or 28.3%. As a percentage of net sales, sales of EPS were 27.4% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 20.6% for the same period in 2015. 

The depreciation of China s currency,
the RMB, against the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015 also caused a decrease
in net sales as more than 80% of the Company s business is conducted in China. 

In summary, the Company had an increase
in sales volume leading to a sales increase of $2.8 million, an increase in average selling price of steering gears leading to
a sales increase of $8.4 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar leading to
a sales decrease of $22.1 million. 

Further analysis by segment (before elimination)
is as follows: 

Net product sales for Henglong were $196.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $206.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $10.1 million, or 4.9%, which was mainly due to the decrease in sales of hydraulic power steering gears, partially offset by the increase in sales of EPS. An increase in sales volume led to a sales increase of $2.0 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $0.7 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $12.8 million.   

Net product sales for Jiulong were $55.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $53.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $1.7 million, or 3.2%. Jiulong is gradually shifting its strategy from focusing on sales volume to focusing on high gross margin products and developing new markets such as exports. A decrease in sales volume led to a sales decrease of $5.2 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $10.2 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $3.3 million.   

Net product sales for Shenyang were $24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $24.1 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $0.8 million, or 3.3%. Shenyang s products are mainly sold to Shenyang Brilliance Jinbei Co., Ltd.,  Brilliance Jinbei , one of China s largest commercial car manufacturers. The sales of Shenyang are mainly impacted by the demand of Brilliance Jinbei. An increase in sales volumes led to a sales increase of $5.8 million, a decrease in average selling price led to a sales decrease of $3.5 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $1.5 million.   

Net product sales for Wuhu were $15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16.1 million for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.2 million, or 1.2%. An increase in sales volumes led to a sales increase of $0.6 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $0.2 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $1.0 million.

Hubei Henglong s products are mainly sold to Chrysler. Chrysler s demand and prices were stable from period to period, so the impact of Chrysler s sales volumes and prices was not significant. An increase in sales volumes led to a sales increase of $0.6 million, an increase in average selling price led to a sales increase of $0.5 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar led to a sales decrease of $2.8 million.   

Net product sales for Other Sectors were $29.6 million for
    the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $27.4 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of
    $2.2 million, or 8.0%, primarily due to an increase in the sales of Chuguanjie, which manufactures electronic systems for
    EPS for Henglong, which were eliminated in consolidation.   

Cost of Products Sold  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the cost of products sold was $253.4 million, compared to $264.1 million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease
of $10.7 million, or 4.1%. The decrease in the cost of products sold was mainly due to the net effect of a net increase in sales
volumes which led to a cost of products sold increase of $6.8 million, a decrease in unit cost which led to a cost of products
sold decrease of $1.9 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar which led to a
cost of products sold decrease of $15.6 million. Further analysis is as follows: 

Cost of products sold for Henglong was $165.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $172.7 million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease of $7.3 million, or 4.2%.

Cost of products sold for Shenyang was $21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.2 million for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $1.5 million, or 7.4%. This increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, which led to a cost of products sold increase of $5.2 million, a decrease in unit cost, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $2.5 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $1.2 million.   

Cost of products sold for Wuhu was $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15.0 million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease of $0.5 million, or 3.3%. The increase in cost of products sold was mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, which led to a cost of products sold increase of $0.6 million, a decrease in unit cost, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.2 million, and the effect of foreign currency translation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, which led to a cost of products sold decrease of $0.9 million.

The increase in sales volumes of Jielong led to a cost of products sold increase of $3.3 million, which was partially offset by the disposal of Fujian Qiaolong.   

Gross margin was 18.9% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to 18.4% in the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 0.5%, mainly due to changes
in the product mix in 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Capital Resources and Use of Cash  

The Company has historically financed its
liquidity requirements from a variety of sources, including short-term borrowings under bank credit agreements, bankers 
acceptances, issuances of capital stock and notes and internally generated cash. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash
and cash equivalents and time deposits included in short-term investments (excluding pledged short-term investment) of $64.5 million,
compared to $90.9 million as of December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $26.4 million, or 29.1%. 

The Company had working capital (total
current assets less total current liabilities) of $172.2 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $177.8 million as of December
31, 2015, representing a decrease of $5.6 million, or 3.1%. 

The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the funds in subsidiaries
established in the PRC. 

The Company believes that, in view of its
current cash position as of September 30, 2016, the cash expected to be generated from the operations and funds available from
bank borrowings as detailed in subsequent paragraphs will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements,
including the repayment of bank loans, for at least twelve months commencing from September 30, 2016. 

Capital Source 

The Company s
capital source is multifaceted, such as bank loans and banker s acceptance facilities. In financing activities and operating
activities, the Company s banks require the Company to sign line of credit agreements and repay all existing borrowings under
such facilities within one year. On the condition that the Company can provide adequate mortgage security and has not violated
the terms of the line of credit agreement, such one year facilities can be extended for another year. 

The Company had short-term loans of $39.9
million (See Note 13) and bankers  acceptances of $74.9 million (See Note 14) as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company currently expects to be able
to obtain similar bank loans, i.e., RMB loans, and bankers  acceptance facilities in the future if it can provide adequate
mortgage security following the termination of the above-mentioned agreements, see the table under  Bank Arrangements 
below for more information. If the Company is not able to do so, it will have to refinance such debt as it becomes due or repay
that debt to the extent it has cash available from operations or from the proceeds of additional issuances of capital stock. Owing
to depreciation, the value of the mortgages securing the above-mentioned bank loans and banker's acceptances will be reduced
by approximately $9.6 million over the next 12 months. If the Company wishes to obtain the same amount of bank loans and banker's
acceptances, it will have to provide additional mortgages of $9.6 million as of the maturity date of such line of credit agreements,
see the table under  Bank Arrangements  below for more information. The Company can still obtain a reduced line of
credit with a reduction of $7.3 million, which is 75.8%, the mortgage rate, of $9.6 million, if it cannot provide additional mortgages.
The Company expects that the reduction in bank loans will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity. 

Bank Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2016, the principal
outstanding under the Company s credit facilities and lines of credit was as follows (figures are in thousands of USD): 

(1)  
      Each of Hubei Henglong s comprehensive credit facilities with China CITIC Bank is required to be guaranteed by Henglong and Hubei Henglong, in addition to the above pledged assets, and Henglong s comprehensive credit facilities with Hua Xia Bank are required to be guaranteed by Hubei Henglong.    

(2)  
      Amount used represents the credit facilities used by the Company for the purpose of bank loans or notes payable during the facility contract period. The loans or notes payable under the credit facilities will remain outstanding regardless of the expiration of the relevant credit facilities until the separate loans or notes payable expire. The amount used includes bank loans of $35.7 million and notes payable of $39.0 million as of September 30, 2016. The remainder of $4.9 million of government loan and $35.9 million of notes payable was secured by its own and a related party s land use right and buildings (see Note 28), bank notes or time deposits without utilization of credit lines.   

(3)  
      In order to obtain lines of credit, the Company needs to pledge certain assets to banks. As of September 30, 2016, the pledged assets included $34.0 million accounts and notes receivable, $6.4 million of time deposits and other pledged assets with assessed value of $72.7 million.   

(4)  
      The amount available is used for the drawdown of bank loans and issuance of bank notes. For the drawdown of bank loans, this amount represents the amount that the Company can borrow immediately; for issuance of bank notes, the Company needs to pledge additional collateral in order to utilize these bank facilities.   

(5)  
      As at the date of this report, the comprehensive credit facilities with China Everbright Bank have expired. The Company is negotiating the renewal of the credit facilities with the bank and expects to obtain the renewal in late November 2016. As the Company has obtained sufficient comprehensive lines of credit from other banks, the Company does not anticipate any significant adverse impact on its financial position if the Company fails to renew these credit facilities.   

(6)  
      The pledged cash deposits, which are disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report, were not included in the assessed mortgage value.   

The Company may request the banks to issue notes payable or
bank loans within its credit line using a 365-day revolving line. 

The Company renewed its existing short-term bank loans and borrowed
new bank loans during 2016 at annual interest rates ranging from 1.5% to 8.2%, and loan terms from four months to eighteen months.
Pursuant to the comprehensive credit line arrangement, the Company pledged and guaranteed: 

1.  
      Equipment with an assessed value of approximately $55.8 million as security for its revolving comprehensive credit facility with Jingzhou Commercial Bank.   

2.  
      Land use rights and buildings with an assessed value of approximately $9.2 million as security for its comprehensive credit facility with China CITIC Bank.   

3.  
      Land use rights and buildings with an assessed value of approximately $7.7 million as security for its comprehensive credit facility with China Everbright Bank.   

4.  
      On May 18, 2012, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with ICBC Macau to obtain the Credit Facility.   

The interest rate of the Credit Facility is calculated based on a three-month LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, subject to the availability of funds and fluctuation at ICBC Macau s discretion. Interest is calculated daily on a 360-day basis and it is to be fixed one day before the first day of each interest period. The interest period is defined as three months from the date of drawdown.

(1)    The notes payable were repaid

Cash
Flows  

(a)        Operating Activities    

Net cash provided by operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $13.1 million, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $24.1
million for the same period of 2015, representing a decrease of $11.0 million, which was mainly due to the net effect of (1) the
decrease in net income excluding non-cash items by $3.4 million and (2) the increase in cash outflows from movements of operating
assets and liabilities by $7.6 million. The increase in cash outflows was primarily due to the offsetting effect of (1) the increase
in cash outflows due to the movement of accounts and notes receivable by $38.3 million as more customers made payments by using
bank acceptance notes instead of cash when the credit terms expire and (2) the increase in cash inflows due to the movement of
accounts and notes payable by $32.0 million.  

(b)        Investing Activities    

The Company used net cash of $46.0 million
in investment activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15.3 million for the same period of 2015,
representing an increase of $30.7 million, which was mainly due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities of short-term investments
of $11.8 million, an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment of $3.1 million, an increase in cash used for purchase
of short-term investments of $15.9 million and an increase in investment under equity method of $7.0 million, offset by an increase
in the cash provided due to cash received from disposal of Fujian Qiaolong of $2.0 million and a decrease in the movement of other
receivables of $4.3 million. 

(c)        Financing Activities    

Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.6 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.4 million
for the same period of 2015, representing an increase of $2.2 million, which was mainly due to the net effect of (1) increased
proceeds of $0.7 million from bank and government loans, (2) payments to repurchase treasury stock of $1.0 million, (3) increased
payments to the non-controlling shareholders of joint ventures and the holders of the Company s common stock of $0.7 million
and $0.3 million, respectively, and (4) decreased repayments of $1.5 million to banks or the government. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.    

There were no material changes to the disclosure
made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 regarding this matter. 

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.     

A.     Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

The Company s management, under the
supervision and with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Messrs. Wu Qizhou and Li Jie,
respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the
end of the period covered by this Report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of
a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this Form
10-Q, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, Messrs. Wu and Li concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of its disclosure control system
are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 

B.      Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A.
