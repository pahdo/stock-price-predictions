 INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    The condensed consolidated financial statements of Global Water Resources, Inc. (the  Company ,  GWRI ,  we ,  us , or  our ) and related disclosures as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company s most recent annual consolidated financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Further, due to the seasonality of our business, the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be consistent with results of operations for the full year.  
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency and the Company s functional currency. 
 As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ), under the rules and regulations of the SEC. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. We elected to take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We have elected to take advantage of some of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements. Also, as an emerging growth company we can elect to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of this extended accounting transition provision. 
 Certain prior period information has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation to reflect a 100.68 to 1.00 stock split effectuated on April 28, 2016. All share and per share amounts presented in these financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split. 
 Corporate Transactions      Sale of certain MXA and WMA contracts     In September 2013, the Company sold its Wastewater Facilities Main Extension Agreements ( MXA ) and Offsite Water Management Agreements ( WMA") for the contemplated Loop 303 service area along with their related rights and obligations to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. ( EPCOR ) (collectively the  Transfer of Project Agreement , or  Loop 303 Contracts ). Pursuant to the Transfer of Project Agreement, EPCOR agreed to pay GWRI approximately $4.1 million over a multi-year period. As part of the consideration, GWRI agreed to complete certain engineering work required in the WMAs, which work had been completed prior to January 1, 2015. As the engineering work has been completed, the Company effectively has no further obligations under the WMAs, the MXAs or the Transfer of Project Agreement. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company had received $2.8 million of proceeds and recognized income of approximately $3.3 million within other income (expense) in the statement of operations related to the gain on sale of these agreements and the proceeds received prior to January 1, 2015 for engineering work required in the WMAs. The Company received additional proceeds of approximately $296,000 in April 2015 and recognized those amounts as income at that time. Receipt of the remaining $1.0 million of proceeds will be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners.  
   Stipulated condemnation of Valencia    On March 17, 2015, the Company reached a settlement agreement for a stipulated condemnation to sell the utility operating as Valencia Water Company, Inc. ( Valencia ) to the City of Buckeye ( Buckeye ), which was approved by Buckeye's City Council on March 19, 2015 and by the Maricopa County Superior Court on June 9, 2015. On July 14, 2015, the Company closed the stipulated condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia with Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement in March 2015, pursuant to which Buckeye acquired the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operations of the utility upon close. Buckeye paid the   
 -7- 

Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $108,000 in working capital adjustments. As a result o  f the transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $43.0 million net of tax liability of $20.2 million during the third quarter of 2015. Buckeye will also pay a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia's prior servic  e areas for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $414,000 and $858,000, respectively, in other   income within the consolidated financial statements related to the growth premium.  
 In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 205-20-45-1,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Discontinued Operations,  the condemnation of Valencia transaction did not meet the criteria of discontinued operations. As the transaction did not change the services provided or the manner in which the Company operates, it was determined the transaction did not represent a strategic shift and therefore did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 
 S ale of Willow Water Valley Co., Inc.    On March 23, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to sell the operations and assets of Willow Water Valley Co., Inc. ( Willow Valley ) to EPCOR. EPCOR purchased the operations, assets and rights used by Willow Valley to operate the utility system for $2.3 million. The transaction was approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC ) on March 10, 2016, and the transaction closed on May 9, 2016. 
 Per ASC 360-10-45-9,  Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the assets and liabilities in the sale of Willow Valley were determined to meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale beginning with our March 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements. The criteria utilized to make this determination were: (i) management had the authority and had entered into an agreement to sell the assets of Willow Valley; (ii) the assets and liabilities were available for immediate sale in their present condition; (iii) the approval from the ACC was probable within the next year; (iv) a reasonable price had been agreed upon; and (v) it was unlikely that significant changes to the agreement would occur prior to approval. In consideration of ASC 205-20-45-1, the Willow Valley transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. As the transaction did not change the services provided nor the manner in which the Company operates, it was determined the transaction did not represent a strategic shift and therefore did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 
 Additionally, as the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Willow Valley were greater than the agreed upon sales price, a loss of $176,000 was recorded in other expense during the first quarter of 2015, when the assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale, to adjust the carrying value of the assets to the agreed upon fair value less cost to sell. An additional loss of $54,000 was recognized upon close of the sale of Willow Valley in the second quarter of 2016. The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Merger of GWR Global Water Resources Corp. ( GWRC )    On May 3, 2016, the Company completed the merger of GWRC into GWRI. At the time of the merger, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company continued as the surviving entity of the merger. See Note 7   Transactions with Related Parties. In conjunction with the merger of GWRC into GWRI, the Company recorded $731,000 in accounts payable and $353,000 in deferred compensation on the books of GWRI that were previously recorded at GWRC. In addition to these liabilities, the Company also recorded an approximate $1.7 million tax liability associated with the transfer of GWRC from Canada to the United States. A corresponding reduction in

  additional paid in capital was recorded with the merging of these liabilities into GWRI.    The 8,726,747   outstanding common shares of the Company held by GWRC, and assumed by the Company at the time of merger, are recorded as treasury stock at a par value of $0.01 per share in our condensed consolidated statement of shareholders  equity.      
 Initial Public Offering    On April 27, 2016, the SEC declared effective the registration statement relating to the public offering of our common stock. On May 3, 2016, the Company completed the initial public offering of 1,164,800 shares of common stock at $6.25 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $7.3 million (the  U.S. IPO ). The Company granted the underwriter the option to purchase up to an additional 174,720 shares of common stock at the same price, which was exercised by the underwriter on May 11, 2016, for additional gross proceeds of $1.1 million. Our shares of common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols  GWRS  and  GWR , respectively.  
 Sonoran Acquisition Liability    On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Sonoran Utility Services, LLC ( Sonoran ) to amend certain provisions of the purchase and sale agreement related to the acquisition of Sonoran s assets on June 15, 2005. The amended agreement allowed the Company to reduce its $3.8 million acquisition liability due to Sonoran by approximately $1.0 million to $2.8 million, if the Company settled the amount due within ten days of the closing of the note purchase agreement. The note purchase agreement closed on June 24, 2016 and the Sonoran liability was subsequently settled in June 2016. Upon settlement of the Sonoran acquisition liability, the Company recorded a gain of $954,000 in other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Private Letter Ruling    On June 2, 2016, the Company received a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the Company under Internal Revenue Code    1033   as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full advantage of the benefits of such ruling.  
 Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code   1033, the Company may defer the gain on condemnation through the end of the year 2017. As such,  the Company has identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan, which we plan to accelerate. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016 and 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019 and beyond.    
 Change in Accounting Principle    The Company historically accounted for stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710,   Compensation   General  , valued using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   ( ASC 718 )  ,   for nonpublic entities. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs. While the SARs will continue to be remeasured at each quarterly reporting date, the SARs are required to be accounted for prospectively at fair value using a fair value pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250,   Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  . The effect of the change increased the SAR liability by $103,000 which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. An offsetting change to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation, net of $38,000 in taxes. Any future changes in fair value will be recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations.  
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
   In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which completes the joint effort between the FASB and IASB to converge the recognition of revenue between the two boards. The new standard affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets not included within other FASB standards. The guiding principal of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for the delivery of goods and services. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1) retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2) adoption with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures. To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should use the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity

  satisfies a perfo  rmance obligation. For public business entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within the reporting period. For private companies, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual repo  rting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is allowed in certain circumstances. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance may have on its conso  lidated financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ), to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: (1) identifying performance obligations; and (2) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. For public business entities, ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within the reporting period. For private companies, ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is allowed in certain circumstances. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ), to address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. The amendment also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers and are expected to reduce the judgment necessary to comply with Topic 606. For public business entities, ASU 2016-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within the reporting period. For private companies, ASU 2016-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is allowed in certain circumstances. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability, consistent with the accounting of debt discounts. The Company s adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 resulted in the reclassification of the unamortized debt issuance costs of $748,000 and $2.2 million from debt issuance costs to a reduction in long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligation for lease arrangements with a term of greater than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements and requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.  This guidance will be effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. This guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual

  periods. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim pe  riods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures  .    
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  ( ASU 2016-16). ASU 2016-16 instructs entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and (compared to current GAAP which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party). The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

 REGULATORY DECISION AND RELATED ACCOUNTING AND POLICY CHANGES    

 Our regulated utilities and certain other balances are subject to regulation by the ACC and meet the requirements for regulatory accounting found within ASC Topic 980,  Regulated Operations . 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 980, rates charged to utility customers are intended to recover the costs of the provision of service plus a reasonable return in the same period. Changes to the rates are made through formal rate applications with the ACC, which we have done for all of our operating utilities and which are described below. 
 On July 11, 2012, we filed formal rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities representing a collective rate increase of approximately 28% over 2011 revenue levels. In August 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with ACC Staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC s Commissioners before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, effectively approving the settlement agreement. The rulings of the decision include, but are not limited to, the following: 

For the Company s utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and sale of Willow Valley, a collective revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands):     

Whereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections increases from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues. 

Full reversal of the imputation of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC ) balances associated with funds previously received under infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs ), as required in the Company s last rate case. The reversal restored rate base or future rate base and had a significant impact of restoring shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The Company has agreed to n  ot enter into any new ICFAs. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, but a portion of future payments to be received under the ICFAs will be considered as hook-up fees, which are accounted for as CIAC once expended on plant.     

A 9.5% return on common equity was adopted.     

None of the Company s utilities will file another rate application before May 31, 2016. GWRI s subsidiaries, Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company ( Santa Cruz ) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company ( Palo Verde ), may not file for another rate increase before May 31, 2017.     

 The following provides additional discussion on accounting and policy changes resulting from Rate Decision No. 74364. 
 Infrastructure Coordination and Financing Agreements    ICFAs are agreements with developers and homebuilders whereby GWRI, the indirect parent of the operating utilities, provides services to plan, coordinate and finance the water and wastewater infrastructure that would otherwise be required to be performed or subcontracted by the developer or homebuilder.  
 Under the ICFAs, GWRI has a contractual obligation to ensure physical capacity exists through its regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. This obligation persists regardless of connection growth. Fees for these services are typically a negotiated amount per equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or portion of land. Payments are generally due in installments, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones, and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. The agreements are generally recorded against the land and must be assumed in the event of a sale or transfer of the land. The regional planning and coordination of the infrastructure in the various service areas has been an important part of GWRI s business model. 
 Prior to January 1, 2010, GWRI accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with the completion of GWRI s performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with GWRI s ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service through its regulated subsidiaries. 
 The 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision No. 71878 established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by the Company that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision by the ACC, GWRI changed its accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January 1, 2010, GWRI recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities.  
 With the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC again changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, and ICFA funds already received would no longer be deemed CIAC for rate making purposes. In conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, we eliminated the CIAC liability and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by the 2010 ruling. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with the Company s ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF ) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, to be accounted for in accordance with the Company's ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. The Company is responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount, even if it results in recording less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue. 
   The Company will account for the portion allocated to the HUF as a CIAC contribution. However, in accordance with the ACC directives the CIAC is not deducted from rate base until the HUF funds are expended for utility plant. Such funds will be segregated in a separate bank account and used for plant. A HUF liability will be established and will be amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the useful life of the related plant once the HUF funds are utilized for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a HUF or ICFA, the utilities must first use the HUF moneys received, after which, it may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The Company will record the 30% as deferred revenue, which is to  
 -12-

 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
  be recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the ICFA are met. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, ICFA deferred revenue recorded on the consolidated balance sheet totaled   $19.7 million, which represents deferred revenue recorded for ICFA funds received on contracts that had become due prior to Rate Decision No. 74364. For ICFA contracts coming due after December 31, 2013, 30% will be added to this balance with the remaining   70% recorded to a HUF liability.  
 Regulatory asset    Under ASC Topic 980, rate regulated entities defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. Certain costs associated with our rate cases have been deferred on our balance sheet as regulatory assets as approved by the ACC. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had one regulatory asset in the amount of $136,000 and $227,000, respectively, related to costs incurred in connection with our most recent rate case. This amount began to amortize in January 2015, and will amortize over a three-year period.   
 Intangible assets / Regulatory liability    The Company previously recorded certain intangible assets related to ICFA contracts obtained in connection with our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde and Sonoran acquisitions. The intangible assets represented the benefits to be received over time by virtue of having those contracts. Prior to January 1, 2010, the ICFA-related intangibles were amortized when ICFA funds were recognized as revenue. Effective January 1, 2010, in connection with the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, these assets became fully offset by a regulatory liability of $11.2 million since the imputation of ICFA funds as CIAC effectively resulted in the Company not being able to benefit (through rates) from the acquired ICFA contracts.  
 Effective January 1, 2010, the gross ICFAs intangibles began to be amortized when cash was received in proportion to the amount of total cash expected to be received under the underlying agreements. However, such amortization expense was offset by a corresponding reduction of the regulatory liability in the same amount. 
 As a result of Rate Decision No. 74364, the Company changed its policy around the ICFA related intangible assets. As discussed above, pursuant to Rate Decision No. 74364, approximately 70% of ICFA funds to be received in the future will be recorded as a HUF at the Company s applicable utility subsidiary. The remaining approximate 30% of future ICFA funds will be recorded at the parent company level and will be subject to the Company s ICFA revenue recognition accounting policy. As the Company now expects to experience an economic benefit from the 30% portion of future ICFA funds, 30% of the regulatory liability, or $3.4 million, was reversed in 2014. The remaining 70% of the regulatory liability, or $7.9 million, will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this was the Company's sole regulatory liability. 
 Subsequent to Rate Decision No. 74364, the intangible assets will continue to amortize when the corresponding ICFA funds are received in proportion to the amount of total cash expected to be received under the underlying agreements. The recognition of amortization expense will be partially offset by a corresponding reduction of the regulatory liability.

 EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE    

 On June 5, 2013, the Company sold Global Water Management, LLC ( GWM ) to an investor group led by a private equity firm that specializes in the water industry. GWM was a wholly-owned subsidiary of GWRI that owned and operated the FATHOM  business. In connection with the sale of GWM, the Company made an investment in the FATHOM  Partnership ( FATHOM  ). This limited partnership investment is accounted for under the equity method due to our investment being considered more than minor. 
 The original investment in FATHOM  consisted of an investment of $750,000 in the Series A preferred units and $98,000 of common units. Additionally, the Company invested $750,000 in a 10% convertible promissory note of GWM with an original maturity of December 31, 2014. We accounted for this investment in accordance with relevant accounting guidance for debt and equity securities which requires the fair value measurement of the investment pursuant to ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement . The fair value of the investment in the convertible notes at initial recognition was determined using the transaction price, of which the price paid by the Company was consistent with the price paid by third party investors for comparable convertible notes. 
 In November 2014, FATHOM  experienced a qualified financing event (qualified financing was defined as an equity financing by FATHOM  in which FATHOM  sells its units for at least $1.75 per unit and the aggregate proceeds from such financing was at least $15 million, exclusive of convertible note amounts converted). At the time of the qualified financing, the convertible promissory note was converted into Series B Preferred Units, and accounted for under the equity method. The Company's resulting ownership of common and preferred units represented an approximate 8.0% ownership (on a fully diluted basis). 
 -14- 
 
 GLOBAL WATER RESOURCES, INC. 
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
    In conjunction with the qualified financing, our equity interest in the Series A and Series B preferred shares   was adjusted in accordance with ASC 323,   Investment-Equity Method   Joint Ventures,   wherein we recorded a gain of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjustment to the carrying value of our investments was calculated using our proportionate sha  re of FATHOM 's adjusted net equity. The gain was recorded within other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The carrying value of our investment consisted of a balance of $487,000 as of September 30, 2016 and $821,000 as of Dece  mber 31, 2015, and reflects our initial investment, the adjustment related to the qualified financing and our proportionate share of FATHOM 's cumulative     earnings   (losses)  .  
 We evaluate our investment in FATHOM  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an  other-than-temporary  decline in value. Since the sale of GWM, the losses incurred on the investment were greater than anticipated; however, based upon our evaluation of various relevant factors, including the 2014 equity event and the ability of FATHOM  to achieve and sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of our investment, we do not believe the investment to be impaired as of September 30, 2016.  
 We have evaluated whether FATHOM  qualifies as a variable interest entity ( VIE ) pursuant to the accounting guidance of ASC 810,  Consolidations . Considering the potential that the total equity investment in FATHOM  may not be sufficient to absorb the losses of FATHOM , the Company currently views FATHOM  as a VIE. However, considering the Company s minority interest and limited involvement with the FATHOM  business, the Company is not required to consolidate FATHOM . Rather, the Company has accounted for its investment under the equity method.

 INTANGIBLE ASSETS    

 Intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Acquired ICFAs and Sonoran contract rights are amortized when cash is received in proportion to the amount of total cash expected to be received under the underlying agreements. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of when cash will be received under ICFA agreements and contract rights, we cannot reliably estimate when the remaining intangible assets' amortization will be recorded. No amortization was recorded for these balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES    

 On January 19, 2016, GWRC announced that it agreed to pursue a reorganization transaction with the Company that resulted in GWRC merging with and into the Company (the  Reorganization Transaction ). GWRC was organized in 2010 to acquire shares of the Company, and held an approximate 47.8% interest in the Company prior to the merger. The Reorganization Transaction closed on May 3, 2016. As a result of the Reorganization Transaction, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, is the surviving entity.

 GLOBAL WATER RESOURCES, INC. 
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
    GWRC was not part of the consolidated Company prior to the completion of the Reorganization Transaction. GWRC had no employees. GWRI provided for the ongoing management and general administ  ration of GWRC s business affairs pursuant to a management agreement between GWRC and GWRI to provide such services. Accordingly, GWRC was economically dependent on the Company. Services provided by the Company under the management agreement were provided   at no charge to GWRC, and were not monetarily significant. However, GWRC incurred certain costs not covered by the management agreement. These included GWRC s accounting fees, legal fees, listing fees and other costs directly associated with its former sta  tus as a publicly traded company. Whereas GWRC did not expect to generate cash flows from operating activities, the operating costs incurred by GWRC and other cash requirements were paid by the Company. Amounts paid by the Company on GWRC s behalf during t  he nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $650,000 and $678,000, respectively. The Company accounted for such payments as equity distributions to GWRC. In conjunction with the merger of GWRC into GWRI, the Company recorded $731,000 in accoun  ts payable and $353,000 in deferred compensation on the books of GWRI that were previously recorded at GWRC. In addition to these liabilities, the Company also recorded an approximate $1.7 million tax liability associated with the transfer of GWRC from Can  ada to the United States. A corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital was recorded with the merging of these liabilities into GWRI.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no cash advance was provided to GWRC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company provided cash advances of approximately $12.7 million to satisfy GWRC's short term cash obligations. The amount advanced was utilized to fund GWRC's monthly dividend, special one-time dividend paid in August 2015 and other cash requirements, as needed. The related party balance was reduced upon dividend declaration, when the amount declared is presented as a reduction in the Company s equity. As of the closing of the Reorganization Transaction and December 31, 2015, the balance of the advance was zero. 
 We provide medical benefits to our employees through our participation in a pooled plan sponsored by an affiliate of a shareholder and director of the Company. Medical claims paid to the plan were approximately $60,000 and $116,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Medical claims paid to the plan were approximately $461,000 and $306,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 GWM has historically provided billing, customer service and other support services for the Company s regulated utilities. Amounts collected by GWM from the Company s customers that GWM has not yet remitted to the Company are included within the  Due from affiliates  caption on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the unremitted balance totaled $314,000 and $306,000, respectively. Notwithstanding the sale of GWM on June 5, 2013, FATHOM  continues to provide these services to the Company s regulated utilities under a long-term service agreement. Based on current service connections, we estimate that fees to be paid to GWM for FATHOM  services will be $7.79 per water account/month, which is an annual rate of approximately $1.8 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred FATHOM  service fees of approximately $467,000 and $483,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred FATHOM  service fees of approximately $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 
 Pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of GWM, the Company is entitled to quarterly royalty payments based on a percentage of certain of GWM s recurring revenues for a 10-year period, up to a maximum of $15.0 million. In addition, the Company entered into a services agreement with GWM whereby the Company has agreed to use the FATHOM  platform for all of its regulated utility services for an initial term of 10 years. The services agreement is automatically renewable thereafter for successive 10-year periods, unless notice of termination is given prior to any renewal period. The services agreement may be terminated by either party for default only and the termination of the services agreement will also result in the termination of the royalty payments payable to the Company. The Company made the election to record these quarterly royalty payments prospectively in income as the amounts are earned. Royalties recorded within other income totaled approximately $87,000 and $81,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Royalties recorded within other income totaled approximately $264,000 and $240,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

2016 Senior Secured Notes    On June 24, 2016, the Company closed the note purchase agreement entered into on May 20, 2016, and issued two series of senior secured notes with an aggregate total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were primarily used to refinance the existing long-term tax exempt bonds, which were subject to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the U.S. IPO. As part of the refinancing of the long-term debt, the Company paid a prepayment penalty of $3.2 million and wrote off the remaining $2.2 million in capitalized loan fees related to the tax exempt bonds, which were recorded as additional interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The senior secured notes are collateralized by a security interest in the Company s equity interest in its subsidiaries, including all payments representing profits and qualifying distributions.   
   The senior secured notes require the Company maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments and dividend or stock repurchases. The senior secured notes also contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending

  March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20  .   As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.  
   
 Tax Exempt Bonds    We issued tax-exempt bonds through The Industrial Development Authority of the County of Pima in the amount of $36,495,000 on December 28, 2006; $53,624,000, net of a discount of $511,000, on November 19, 2007; and $24,550,000 on October 1, 2008. Proceeds from these bonds were used for qualifying costs of constructing and equipping the water and wastewater treatment facilities of our subsidiaries, Palo Verde and Santa Cruz. The tax-exempt bonds were redeemed in June 2016 with proceeds from the 2016 senior secured notes.  
 Debt Issuance Costs Reclassification  -   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability, consistent with the accounting of debt discounts. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.2 million from debt issuance costs to a reduction in long-term debt as of   December 31, 2015  .  
 At September 30, 2016, the remaining aggregate annual maturities of our debt and minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in thousands): 

At September 30, 2016, the carrying value of the non-current portion of long-term debt was $115.2 million, with an estimated fair value of $116.3 million. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the non-current portion of long-term debt was $104.7 million, with an estimated fair value of $116.7 million. The fair value of our debt was estimated based on interest rates considered available for instruments of similar terms and remaining maturities. 

The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. 
 ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , prescribes the method to determine whether a deferred tax asset is realizable and significant weight is given to evidence that it can be objectively verified. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s valuation allowance totaled $8,500, which relates to state net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards expected to expire prior to utilization.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we have approximately $14.8 million in federal NOL carryforwards and $7.7 million in state NOLs available to offset future taxable income. 
   
   The effective tax rates used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 37.0% and 37.3%, respectively. The income tax provision was computed based on the Company s estimated effective tax rate and forecasted income expected for the

 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
  full year, including the impact of any unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring items. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was greater than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to state income taxes  .   

11.   
 
 DEFERRED COMPENSATION AWARDS    

 Stock-based compensation    Stock-based compensation related to option awards is measured based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize compensation expense associated with the options over the vesting period.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were options to acquire 47,422 shares of common stock of GWRI outstanding, adjusting for the 100.68 to 1.00 stock split effected on April 28, 2016. The options were all vested and exercisable as of each date. The stock options have a remaining contractual life of approximately 2.00 years and have a split-adjusted exercise price of $8.65 per share. 
 GWRI stock option grant    In May 2016, GWRI s Board of Directors granted stock options to acquire 325,000 shares of GWRI s common stock to the members of the board. The options were granted with an exercise price of $7.50, the prevailing market price of the Company s common shares at the close of business on May 20, 2016. The options vest over a two-year period, with 50% vesting on May 2017 and 50% vesting on May 2018. The options have a three-year life. The Company will expense the $2.1 million fair value of the stock option grant ratably over the two-year vesting period in accordance with ASC 323. Stock-based compensation expense of $265,000 and $383,000 was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Phantom stock compensation    On December 30, 2010, we adopted a phantom stock unit plan authorizing the directors of the Company to issue phantom stock units (  PSUs  ) to our employees. Following the consummation of the Reorganization Transaction, the awarded PSUs have been amended such that the outstanding units now track with the value of GWRI s share price. The vesting of the awards has not changed. The value of the PSUs issued under the plan track to the performance of GWRI s shares and give rise to a right of the holder to receive a cash payment the value of which, on a particular date, is the market value of the equivalent number of shares of GWRI at that date. The issuance of PSUs as a core component of employee compensation was intended to strengthen the alignment of interests between the employees of the Company and the shareholders of GWRI by linking their holdings and a portion of their compensation to the future value of the common shares of GWRI.  
 PSUs are accounted for as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710,  Compensation   General , rather than as equity awards. PSU awards are remeasured each period and a liability is recorded equal to GRWI s closing share price as of the balance sheet date multiplied by the number of units vested and outstanding. The value of the benefits is recorded as an expense in the Company s financial statements over the related vesting period. Vesting occurs ratably over 12 consecutive quarters beginning in the period granted. The following table details total awards granted and the number of units outstanding as of September 30, 2016 along with the amounts paid to holders of the PSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except unit amounts):

  entities, with changes to the value of the SARs recognized as compensa  tion expense at each quarterly reporting date. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs. While the SARs will continue to be remeasured at ea  ch quarterly reporting date, the SARs are required to be accounted for prospectively at fair value using a fair value pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a chang  e in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250. The effect of the change increased the SAR liability by $103,000 which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method.   An offsetting change to   accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation, net of $38,000 in taxes. Any future changes in fair value will be recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations  .  
 Beginning January 2012, in an effort to reward employees for their performance, the Company adopted a stock appreciation rights plan authorizing the directors of the Company to issue SARs to our employees. The value of the SARs issued under the plan track the performance of GWRI s shares. Each holder has the right to receive a cash payment amounting to the difference between the exercise price and the closing price of GWRI s common shares on the exercise date, provided that the closing price is in excess of the exercise price. Holders of SARs may exercise their awards once vested. Individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the Company forfeit their rights under the awards. The following table details the recipients of the awards, the grant date, units granted, exercise price, outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016 and amounts paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per unit amounts): 

(1)   
 
 The SARs vested in equal installments over four quarters and expire four years after the date of issuance.    

(2)   
 
 The SARs vest ratably over sixteen quarters from the grant date.    

(3)   
 
 The SARs vest over sixteen quarters, vesting 20% per year for the first three years, with the remainder (40%) vesting in year four.    

(4)   
 
 The exercise price was determined by taking the weighted average share price of the five days prior to the grant date of July 1, 2013.    

(5)   
 
 The exercise price was determined by taking the weighted average share price of the 30 days prior to the grant date of November 14, 2013.    

(6)   
 
 The exercise price was determined to be the fair market value of one share of stock on the grant date of February 11, 2015.    

(7)   
 
 The exercise price was determined to be the fair market value of one share of stock on the grant date of May 8, 2015.    

 As a result of the merger of GWRC into the Company and the U.S. IPO, the exercise prices for the preceding awards were translated to U.S. dollars using the prevailing noon-day Bank of Canada foreign exchange rate of US$0.7969 per CAD$1.00 as measured on May 2, 2016, the day prior to the closing of the merger. The vesting of the awards has not changed. Subsequent to the merger, each SAR will provide the holder the right to receive a cash payment amounting to the difference between the per share exercise price and the closing price of GWRI s common shares on the exercise date, provided that the closing price is in excess of exercise price per share.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

 Commitments    Prior to the sale of GWM, we leased certain office space in Arizona under operating leases with terms that expired in February 2016. The operating lease agreements were between GWM and the landlord. Accordingly, effective June 2013 through February 2016, the Company was not a party under the lease agreements. GWRI subleased a portion of the office space covered under the GWM lease agreements. In February 2016, the Company entered into a three-year lease agreement with the landlord to occupy the same space previously subleased under GWM's lease agreements, inclusive of necessary facility upgrades. Beginning in March 2016, the Company began recording approximately $8,000 in monthly rent expense related to the new agreement. Rent expense arising from the operating leases totaled approximately $25,000 and $15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $67,000 and $49,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Contingencies 
 From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to pending or threatened lawsuits in which claims for monetary damages are asserted.  Management is not aware of any legal proceeding of which the ultimate resolution could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

On November 14, 2016, the Company announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.022 per share ($0.264 per share annually) to $0.0225 per share ($0.270 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock we may issue in the future, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

 Overview 
 We are a water resource management company that owns, operates and manages water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as "Total Water Management," a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the world's water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices. 
 Business Outlook 
 2015 and 2016 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections and re-establishing service on existing previously vacant homes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 4.2 million in 2010 and is the 14th largest MSA in the U.S., an increase of 29% over the 3.25 million people reported in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix s growth data continues to improve due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Maricopa County will have a population of 4.5 million by 2020 and 6.0 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Arizona s employment rate improved by 2.9%, ranking the state in the top seven nationally for job growth. 
   Also, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus panel, most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the W.P. Carey School of Business, using U.S. Census data, reported that single family housing permits were approximately 11,700 units for 2014. However, for 2015, permits were up approximately 43% to 16,768 units in Maricopa and Pinal Counties combined, and the forecasts for 2016, 2017, and 2018 remain positive at approximately 19,000 units, 22,000 permits, and 25,000, respectively. From there, we  
 -22- 

believe growth in the region could steadily return towards its normal historical rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits. Additionally, multifamily, office, retail, and industrial market oc  cupancy rates continued to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 and are expected to continue to increase through 2017.  
 We believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas. 
 Factors Affecting our Results of Operations 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to: 

population and community growth;     

economic and environmental utility regulation;     

economic environment;     

the need for infrastructure investment;     

production and treatment costs;     

weather and seasonality; and     

access to and quality of water supply.     

 We are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission ( ACC ). The US federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments. 
 Population and Community Growth 
 Population and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, decreased 884 connections, or 2.3%, from a total of 38,620 as of September 30, 2015 to 37,736 as of September 30, 2016. This decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley Water Co., Inc. ( Willow Valley ). See   Recent Events  for additional information. Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, total service connections increased to 37,736 as of September 30, 2016 from 37,118 as of December 31, 2015, which represents an increase of 618 connections, or an annualized increase of approximately 2.2%.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we have 37,009 active service connections compared to 37,638 active service connections as of September 30, 2015, a decrease of 629 or 1.7%. As with the decrease in total service connections, the decrease is due to the sale of Willow Valley. Adjusting for the sale of Willow Valley, active service connections increased 886 connections, or 2.5%, to 37,009 as of September 30, 2016 compared to 36,123 as of September 30, 2015. Approximately 98.8% of the 37,009 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC ( Santa Cruz ) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC ( Palo Verde ) utilities as of September 30, 2016.  
 -23- 

The graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the condemnation of   the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley.  
   
 During the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.2% of our total connections at the time; however, the negative trend began to reverse thereafter with the number of vacant homes decreasing to 727 or 1.9% of total connections as of September 30, 2016. 
 Economic and Environmental Utility Regulation 
 We are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred and to set  just and reasonable  rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of construction ( CIAC ) and advances in aid of construction ( AIAC ) which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a collection main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been  prudently invested  and  used and useful , although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a  rate of return  on that rate base, which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding  prudently  incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation and any applicable pro forma adjustments. 
 To ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or  basic service charge,  provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component. 
   We are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our recent settlement with the ACC and extended new rate phase-in period, we will not be initiating the next rate case on this timeline. Moving forward, we will continue to analyze all factors  
 -24- 

that drive the requirement for increased revenue, including our rate of investment and recurring expenses, and determine the appropriate test year for a future rate case. See   Recent Rate Case Activities.   
 Our water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive United States federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect, treat and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation. 
 Environmental, health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag. 
 Economic Environment 
 The growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and the growth rate of development, especially residential development, since 2006 (both nationally and in Arizona) has been and continues to be below historical rates. In addition, development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. 
 Infrastructure Investment 
 Capital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our  used and useful  rate base, which is a component of its permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge. 
   
 We have made significant capital investments in our territories within the last twelve years, and because the infrastructure is new, we do not expect comparable capital investments to be required in the near term, either for growth or to maintain the existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements and improve our overall financial performance, by lowering expenses and increasing revenue. Additionally, to reduce our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company, we have identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan that we determined through a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service will qualify under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1033 re-investment criteria; however, the timeline to make such investments is limited through the end of 2017. Accordingly, we plan to accelerate the identified capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016 and 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019 and beyond.  
 Production and Treatment Costs 
 Our water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants. 
 -25- 

Weather and Seasonality  
 Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas make the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenue are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year. 
 Access to and Quality of Water Supply 
 In many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. 
 Recent Rate Case Activity 
 On July 11, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC s commissioners before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 74364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011. 
 For our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands): 

Whereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues. 
 From 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 183 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements ( ICFAs ) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development. 
 -26- 

Prior to January 1, 2010, we accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with   developers and not with the   water or wastewater customer, the timing of r  evenue recognition coincided with the completion of our performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with our ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service to the applicable development or parcel through our regu  lated subsidiaries.  
 The 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision No. 71878 established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by us that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision by the ACC, we changed our accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January 1, 2010, we recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities.  
 With the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC again changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds, and ICFA funds already received would no longer be deemed CIAC for rate making purposes. In conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, we eliminated the CIAC liability and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by the 2010 ruling. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee ( HUF ) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, to be accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount, even if it results in recording less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue. 
 We now account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to hook-up fee liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator s perspective, hook-up fees do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used for plant. A hook-up fee liability, once established, will be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or ICFA, we must first use the hook-up fee funds received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The 30% deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met. 
 We have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead will utilize hook-up fee tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a hook-up fee tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, but a portion (approximately 70%) of future payments to be received under the ICFAs will be considered as hook-up fees, which are accounted for as CIAC once expended on plant (i.e., hook-up fees will be recorded as a liability, but will only reduce rate base once such funds are expended on plant). The remaining approximate 30% of future ICFA payments will be recognized using the same income recognition accounting applied to ICFA funds already received, wherein such funds will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue. 
 In addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, whereby funds, water line extensions or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These advances in aid of construction are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements  refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we transferred $376,000 of AIAC balances to CIAC. 
 Recent Events 
 Reorganization Transaction 
   On January 19, 2016, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. ( GWRC ) announced that it agreed to pursue a reorganization transaction with the Company that resulted in GWRC merging with and into the Company (the  Reorganization Transaction ). The Reorganization Transaction closed on May 3, 2016. GWRC was organized in 2010 to acquire shares of the Company, and held an approximate 47.8% interest prior to the merger. The Reorganization Transaction was part of the Company s overall plan to simplify its corporate structure by eliminating one level of holding company ownership, refinance its outstanding tax-exempt bonds on more favorable terms (as described below), improve liquidity for shareholders over the medium to long-term and have a single governing jurisdiction in the U.S., where all of the assets, operations and employees of the business are located. As a result of the merger,

GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, is the surviving entity.   
 Debt Refinancing 
 With the completion of the initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in the United States ( U.S. IPO ), the Company had the right to redeem all of its outstanding tax-exempt bonds at a price of 103% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued at the redemption date. Following completion of the U.S. IPO, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement to issue two series of senior secured notes with total principal balance of $115.0 million. On June 24, 2016, the Company closed the note purchase agreement, which proceeds were primarily used to pay down the outstanding $106.7 million in tax-exempt bonds at 103%. For additional information, see   Liquidity and Capital Resources Senior Secured Notes.  
 Stipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia Water Company 
 On July 14, 2015, the Company closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $108,000 in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia Water Company s prior service areas, for a 20-year period ending December 31, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement. 
 Sale of Willow Valley 
 On March 23, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to sell the operations and assets of Willow Valley to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. ( EPCOR ). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, EPCOR purchased all the operations, assets and rights used by Willow Valley to operate the utility system for $2.3 million. The transaction was approved by the ACC on March 10, 2016, and we closed the transaction on May 9, 2016. 
 Sale of Loop 303 Contracts 
 In September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements and offsite water management agreements for the contemplated Loop 303 service area, along with their related rights and obligations (which we refer to collectively as the  Loop 303 Contracts ), relating to the 7,000-acre territory within a portion of the western planning area of the City of Glendale, Arizona known as the  Loop 303 Corridor.  Pursuant to the agreement, we sold the Loop 303 Contracts to EPCOR for total proceeds of approximately $4.1 million ($3.1 million of which has been received as of September 30, 2016), which will be paid to us over a multi-year period. Receipt of the remaining proceeds will occur and be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners of the Loop 303 Corridor. As part of the consideration, we agreed to complete certain engineering work required in the offsite water management agreements, which we completed in 2013, thereby satisfying our remaining obligations relating to the Loop 303 Contracts. In April 2015, we received proceeds of approximately $296,000 related to the sale of the Loop 303 Contracts. As of September 30, 2016, proceeds of $1.0 million remain outstanding, and will be recorded as additional income over time as certain milestones are met between EPCOR and the developers/landowners. 
 Sonoran Acquisition Liability 
 On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Sonoran Utility Services, LLC ( Sonoran ) to amend certain provisions of the purchase and sale agreement related to the acquisition of Sonoran s assets on June 15, 2005. The amended agreement allowed the Company to reduce its $3.8 million acquisition liability due to Sonoran to $2.8 million, if the Company settled the amount due within ten days of the closing of the note purchase agreement. The note purchase agreement closed on June 24, 2016 and the Sonoran liability was subsequently settled in June 2016. Upon settlement of the Sonoran acquisition liability, the Company recorded a gain of $954,000 in other income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Private Letter Ruling 
   On June 2, 2016, the Company received a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, for purposes of deferring the gain realized from the condemnation of Valencia Water Company, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of Valencia Water Company could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the Company under  
 -28- 

Internal Revenue Code    1033   as property similar or related in service or use. In June 2016, the Company converted all operating subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies to take full a  dvantage of the benefits of such ruling.  
 Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code   1033, the Company may defer the gain on condemnation through the end of the year 2017. As such,  the Company has identified certain currently planned investments within our capital improvement plan, which we plan to accelerate. As a result, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016 and 2017 as compared to recent years, with corresponding reductions to occur in 2018, 2019 and beyond. 
   
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures 
 This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section contains references to  EBITDA  and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this management s discussion and analysis as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) non-recurring events, (ii) option expense related to awards made to the board of directors and (iii) equity method investment. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our systems. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it provides a measure of our recurring core business. 
 However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized earnings measures under U.S. GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management s method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, the most comparable GAAP measure, is included below under the caption  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  
 Segment Reporting 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification 280,  Segment Reporting , we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment. 
 While we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
   
 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Revenues    The following table summarizes our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).  

Total revenues increased $37,000, or 0.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue is driven by an increase in wastewater revenue, offset by a decrease in water revenue due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company, which occurred in July 2015, and the sale of Willow Valley which occurred in May of 2016, and which operations, together, contributed revenue of $585,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley was offset by an increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $623,000, or 8.2%, to $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 in February 2014 combined with a 2.5% increase in active service connections (adjusted for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley) and an increase in consumption during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by a $144,000 reduction in unregulated revenue. 
 Water Services    Water services revenues decreased $64,000, or 1.5%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the Willow Valley sale, which operations, together, contributed $585,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue is partially offset by an increase in water service revenues for the remaining operating utilities of $521,000, or 14.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.    
   Water services revenue based on consumption increased $279,000, or 15.0%, to $2.1 million from $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in active water connections and an increase in consumption compared to 2015, offset by a decrease in active water connections related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed $222,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley was more than offset by an increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $501,000, or 30.6%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in water service revenues for the remaining utilities  
 -30- 

increased in relation to the onset of new rates in 2016 combined with an increase in active water connections and an increase in consumption compared to 2015.  
 Active water connections decreased 5.4% to 18,824 as of September 30, 2016 from 19,890 as of September 30, 2015 as the result of the sale of Willow Valley. However, after adjusting to remove the active water service connections of Willow Valley, active connections increased 449, or 2.4%, to 18,824 as of September 30, 2016 from 18,375 as of September 30, 2015.  
 Water consumption increased 0.4% to 743 million gallons for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 740 million gallons for the three months ended September 30, 2015. However, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, accounted for 43 million gallons of consumption for the three months ended September 30, 2015, water consumption increased 6.6% from 697 million gallons to the 743 million gallons. The increased consumption can be attributed to the 2.5% increase in active connections (in each case adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley) combined with an increase in irrigation use for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Water services revenue, excluding miscellaneous charges associated with the basic service charge, decreased $252,000, or 12.0%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in basic water service revenue is primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed $256,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Wastewater and Recycled Water Services    Wastewater and recycled water services revenues increased $245,000, or 6.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 in February 2014 as well as the increase of active connections, which increased 2.5% to 18,185 as of September 30, 2016 from 17,748 as of September 30, 2015.   
 Recycled water revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $62,000, or 36.4%, to $231,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $170,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The recycled water revenue increase is primarily related to an increase in rates offset by a decline in volume delivered. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased 11 million gallons, or 5.2%, to 201 million gallons for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 212 million gallons for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Recycled water rates increased 30% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2015.  
 Unregulated Revenues    Unregulated revenues, which are primarily rental fees derived from leases of space on a utility-owned communications tower and the imputed revenue resulting from our public-private partnership with the City of Maricopa, decreased $144,000, or 87.8%, to $20,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $164,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by the expiration of the temporary arrangement within the public-private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa, wherein we agreed to offset the cash payment of our license fee through December 31, 2015 for certain utility related services we provided to the City of Maricopa. These commitments were previously finalized, and the associated license fees were being accounted for as unregulated revenue until the expiration of the temporary arrangement on December 31, 2015.  
 Operating Expenses    The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  

Operations and Maintenance    Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased power), maintenance costs, property tax and services contracted from FATHOM TM , decreased $145,000, or 6.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Total personnel costs decreased $6,000, or 1.4%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in personnel related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $67,000 for the three months ended  
 -31- 

September 30, 2015. This decrease in personnel expenses was p  artially offset by an increase of $61,000, or 16.7%, in the personnel expenses of the remaining operating utilities, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Personnel expense for the remaining ut  ilities primarily increased due to an increase in medical expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Utilities and power expenses increased $24,000, or 6.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Utilities and power expense increased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed a benefit of $10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, utility expense for the remaining operating utilities increased $14,000, or 3.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Chemicals, consumables and supplies expenses decreased $15,000, or 11.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Chemicals, consumables and supplies expenses primarily decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Property taxes decreased $73,000, or 13.8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Property taxes decreased due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Property taxes were further reduced by a decrease in property taxes for the remaining operating utilities, which decreased $49,000, or 9.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues of the Company. As revenues increase, we expect that property taxes will increase. 
 Operations and Maintenance   Related Party    Operations and maintenance related party expenses are for service fees paid to FATHOM  with respect to billing, customer service and other support provided to our regulated utilities. Service fees payable to FATHOM  decreased $16,000, or 3.3%, to $467,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $483,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. FATHOM  service fees decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which together, represented $54,000 in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in service fees were partially offset by an increase in service fees for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $38,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. FATHOM  service fees for the remaining operating utilities increased in relation to an increase in their active water connections combined with a Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) increase in the monthly charge pursuant to the services contract.  
 General and Administrative    General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operation, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent and regulatory fees. These costs decreased $57,000 or 2.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Personnel costs decreased $542,000, or 46.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Personnel costs primarily decreased as a result of a non-recurring bonus of $591,000 paid in relation to the one-time dividend declared for stock appreciation rights held by management at the time of declaration in August 2015.  
 General liability insurance increased $43,000, or 62.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to director and officer insurance expense, which increased in relation to the completed IPO in May 2016 and listing as a U.S. public company. 
 City of Maricopa Memo of Understanding fees increased $92,000, or 63.4%. Previously, we agreed to offset the cash payments associated with the license fees through December 31, 2015 with miscellaneous utility related services provided by us to the City of Maricopa. Beginning in January 2016, we began to pay the City of Maricopa for the license fees calculated at 3% of revenues of Palo Verde Utility Company and Santa Cruz Water Company. 
 Professional fees, which include legal and accounting costs, increased $75,000, or 35.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in professional fees is primarily due to a $259,000 legal expense reclassification during the three months ended September 30, 2015, in which we reclassified certain legal expenses incurred as part of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company against the gain on condemnation. Without the 2015 reclassification, legal expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 would have decreased $184,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 -32- 

Investor relations expenses increased from zero to $58,000 for the three months ended September 30, 201  5   compared to the three months ended September 30, 201  6  . Public company expenses were historically   recorded at GWRC.  
 Board compensation expense increased $278,000, or 339.0%. This increase in board compensation expense is primarily related to $265,000 of option expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to zero expense in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Option expense increased in relation to the grant of 325,000 options to members of our board of directors in May of 2016. 
 Miscellaneous expenses increased $23,000 or 57.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily related to a $25,000 increase of public company costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Public company costs were historically recorded at GWRC. 
 Depreciation    Depreciation expense decreased by $370,000, or 19.5%, to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in depreciation is primarily related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, recorded depreciation of approximately $236,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Also contributing to the decrease was certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives and, therefore, having been fully depreciated.  
 Other Income (Expense )   Other net expense totaled $802,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income of $41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $41.9 million in other income was primarily attributed to the $43.1 million gain associated with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia that occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2015, slightly offset by a decrease in interest expense of $1.1 million.   
 Interest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 44.4%, to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.4 million of net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the June 2016 debt refinancing, which reduced quarterly interest expense by approximately $459,000.  Interest expense was further reduced through the retirement of the MidFirst loan in July 2015, wherein we recorded $243,000 in interest expense at the time of retirement combined with $282,000 in expense related to the write off of the remaining deferred loan fees. 
 Other Income (Expense)   related party increased $103,000, to an income of $72,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $31,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Other related party income (expense) includes royalty income based upon a percentage of certain FATHOM TM    recurring revenue combined with the equity method gains and losses associated with our equity method investment in FATHOM TM . The change in other related party income (expense) is primarily associated with a decrease in the equity method losses recorded. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, equity method investment losses decreased $97,000, or 86.3%, to $15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to losses of $112,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit    Income tax expense of $717,000 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The income tax expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily related to an increase in current period operating income combined with the $1.1 million decrease in interest expense. Tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was driven by $20.2 million in expense recorded in connection with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company.  
 Net Income    Our net income totaled $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $20.8 million decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributed to the $43.1 million gain associated with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company that occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2015, net of the related $20.2 million tax expense. In addition to net gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company, net income was positively impacted by a $609,000 improvement in operating income and a $1.1 million reduction of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA    EBITDA totaled $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $47.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

A   reconciliation of Net Income     to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for   the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):  

(1)   
 
 EBITDA is defined as income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss). See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures  for further information regarding EBITDA.    

(2)   
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) non-recurring events, (ii) option expense related to awards made to the board of directors and (iii) equity method investment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures  for further information regarding EBITDA.    

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
   
 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Revenues    The following table summarizes our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).  

Total revenues decreased $2.3 million, or 9.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues is primarily related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company which occurred in July 2015 and the sale of Willow Valley in May of 2016, and which operations, together, contributed revenue of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $306,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The decrease related to the condemnation of   the operations and assets of   Valencia Water   Company and the sale of Willow Valley was partially offset by an increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $1.3 million, or 6.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30,   2015. The increase in revenue for the remaining operating utilities reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 in February 2014 combined with a 2.5% increase in their active service connections (adjusted for the condemnation of the o  perations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley) combined with an increase in consumption during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015.   This increase was partially offset by a   $406,000 reduction in unregulated revenue, otherwise total revenue would have increased by approximately 8.1%.  
 Water Services    Water services revenues decreased $2.4 million, or 18.5%, to $10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $306,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue was partially offset by an increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities of $1.1 million, or 12.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Water services revenue based on consumption decreased $644,000, or 11.8%, to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $67,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in water service revenue related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley was partially offset by an increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $912,000, or 23.7%, to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in water service revenue for the remaining operating utilities is related to the onset of new rates in 2016 combined with an increase in active water connections and an increase in consumption compared to 2015. Consumption primarily increased due to an increase in water provided for irrigation. 
 Active water connections decreased 5.4% to 18,824 as of September 30, 2016 from 19,890 as of September 30, 2015 primarily as the result of the sale of Willow Valley. However, after adjusting to remove the active water service connections of Willow Valley, active connections increased 2.4% to 18,824 as of September 30, 2016 from 18,375 as of September 30, 2015.  
 Water consumption decreased 10.5% to 1.7 billion gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.9 billion gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. However, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, accounted for 454 million gallons of consumption for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 17 million gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, water consumption increased 16.0% to 1.7 billion gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.5 billion gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in consumption can be attributed to the increase in active connections (in each case adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley), the increase in irrigation consumption, and the decrease in precipitation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Water services revenues, excluding miscellaneous charges associated with the basic service charge decreased $1.7 million, or 22.6%, to $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in basic water service revenue is primarily driven by the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, contributed $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $235,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in basic revenues for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $165,000, or 3.1%, to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting growth in total active connections as well as an increase in rates due to Rate Decision No. 74364. 
 Wastewater and Recycled Water Services    Wastewater and recycled water services revenues increased $579,000, or 5.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase reflects the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364 in February 2014 as well as the increase of active connections, which increased 2.5% to 18,185 as of September 30, 2016 from 17,748 as of September 30, 2015.  
   Recycled water revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, increased $157,000, or 40.1%, to $550,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $392,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The recycled water revenue increase is a function of an increase in rates and volume delivered. The volume of recycled water delivered increased 9 million  
 -35- 

gallons, or 1.  8%, to 500 million gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 491 million gallons for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Recycled water rates increased 30% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2015.  
 Unregulated Revenues    Unregulated revenues, which are primarily rental fees derived from leases of space on a utility-owned communications tower and the imputed revenue resulting from our public-private partnership with the City of Maricopa, decreased $406,000, or 87.1%, to $60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $466,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by the expiration of the temporary arrangement within the public-private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa, wherein we agreed to offset the cash payment of our license fee through December 31, 2015 for certain utility related services we provide to the City of Maricopa. These commitments were previously finalized, and the associated license fees were being accounted for as unregulated revenue until the expiration of the temporary arrangement on December 31, 2015.  
 Operating Expenses    The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  

Operations and Maintenance    Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased power), maintenance costs, property tax and services contracted from FATHOM TM , decreased $1.1 million, or 15.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Total personnel costs decreased $293,000, or 18.3%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in personnel related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $491,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease in personnel expenses was partially offset by an increase of $139,000, or 12.6%, in personnel expenses of the remaining operating utilities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Personnel expense for the remaining operating utilities increased due to organizational changes combined with an increase in medical expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Utilities and power expenses decreased $173,000, or 13.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Utilities and power expense decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $216,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $11,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in utilities expense was partially offset by an increase in the utility expense of the remaining operating utilities, which increased $33,000, or 3.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Chemicals, consumables and supplies expenses increased $18,000, or 4.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Chemicals, consumables and supplies expenses decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $70,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $11,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was offset by an increase in the chemicals, consumables and supplies expense for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $76,000, or 21.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the additional chemicals used to enhance performance of the wastewater facility. 
 Property taxes decreased $247,000, or 14.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Property taxes primarily decreased due to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations, together, represented $206,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Property tax expense for the remaining operating utilities also decreased $42,000, or 2.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues. As revenues increase, we expect that property taxes will continue to increase.

Operations and Maintenance   Related Party     Operations and maintenance related party expenses are for service fees pa  id to FATHOM  with respect to billing, customer service and other support provided to our regulated utilities. Service fees paid to FATHOM  decreased $309,000, or 18.0%, to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. FATHOM  service fees primarily decreased as a result of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of   Willow Valley, which   operations, together,   represented   $439,000 in   expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in service fees for the remaining operating utilities, which increased $70,000 for the nine m  onths ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. FATHOM  service fees for the remaining operating utilities increased in relation to an increase in their active water connections combined with a CPI increase in the month  ly charge pursuant to the services contract.  
 General and Administrative    General and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operation, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent and regulatory fees. These costs increased $1.2 million, or 20.7%, to $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Personnel related costs decreased $546,000, or 21.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease is driven by a non-recurring bonus of $591,000 paid in relation to the one-time dividend declared for stock appreciation rights held by management at the time of declaration in August 2015. 
 Deferred compensation costs increased $771,000, or 179.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Deferred compensation increased in relation to the change in stock price. An increase in stock price leads to an increase in the liability and associated expense recorded for units outstanding. The stock price increased from a USD adjusted stock price of $5.46 as of December 31, 2015 to $8.01 as of September 30, 2016, a 46.7% increase. Deferred compensation expense also increased with the continued vesting of outstanding phantom stock units and stock appreciation rights at a higher price.  
 General liability insurance increased $50,000, or 22.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to director and officer insurance expense, which increased in relation to the completed IPO in May 2016 and listing as a U.S. public company.  
 City of Maricopa Memo of Understanding fees increased $236,000 or 57.0%, to $650,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $414,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Previously, we agreed to offset the cash payments associated with the license fees through December 31, 2015 with miscellaneous utility related services provided by us to the City of Maricopa. Beginning in January 2016, we began paying the City of Maricopa for the license fees calculated at 3% of revenues of Palo Verde Utility Company and Santa Cruz Water Company. 
 Investor relations expenses increased from zero to $70,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Public company expenses were historically recorded at GWRC. 
 Board compensation costs increased $621,000, or 222.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in board compensation is primarily related to a $383,000 stock option expense associated with the 2016 option grant for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, board compensation expense was further increased with the change in stock price, which increased from a USD adjusted stock price of $5.46 as of December 31, 2015 to a stock price of $8.01 as of September 30, 2016. 
 Miscellaneous expenses increased $44,000 or 29.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily related to an increase of $48,000 of public company costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Public company costs were historically recorded at GWRC.  
 Depreciation    Depreciation expense decreased by $1.8 million, or 27.2%, to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company and the sale of Willow Valley, which operations recorded depreciation of approximately $63,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The additional decrease is due to the decreased depreciable base of the Company's fixed assets as a result of certain assets becoming fulling depreciated.  
   Other Income (Expense )   Other net expense totaled $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net income of $37.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in other expense is primarily driven by a $41.8 million decrease in other income, combined with an increase of $4.1 million in interest expense. Interest expense increased 63.1% to $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 -37- 

Interest expense increased due to the refinancing of debt that was completed in June of 2016. As part of the refinancing, we paid $3.2 million in prepayment penalties and wrote off the   remaining $2.2 million in capitalized loan fees related to the retired bonds. However, factoring in the impact of the prepayment penalty and the write-off of capitalized loan fees, interest expense decreased $1.3 million in relation to the lower interest   rates associated with the recent debt refinancing and the   retirement of the Mid  F  irst loan in July   2015.  
 Other income decreased to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income of $43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily attributed to the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company of $43.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $954,000 gain on the settlement of the Sonoran purchase liability, which occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Sonoran liability was originally due in June 2018, however, by accelerating the payoff of the liability, we were able to reduce the original liability of $3.8 million to $2.8 million. Additionally, other income includes approximately $858,000 related to the Valencia Water Company earn out for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $399,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, wherein we receive $3,000 for each new meter installed in the Valencia Water Company service area. These gains were partially offset by a $54,000 loss on sale of Willow Valley Water Company in May of 2016, compared to $176,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and a gain of $296,000 related to proceeds received in relation to the sale of Loop 303 Contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Other Income (Expense)   related party   decreased $99,000, to a loss of $70,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $29,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Other related party income (expense) includes royalty income based upon a percentage of certain FATHOM  recurring revenue combined with the equity method gains and losses associated with our equity method investment in FATHOM . The change in the other related party income (expense) is primarily associated with an increase in the equity method losses recorded. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, equity method investment losses increased $122,000, or 57.5%, to $333,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to losses of $212,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense)    Income tax benefit increased $22.4 million to $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is related to current period losses, which were driven by an increase in interest expense and a decrease in operating income. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was driven by the $20.2 million tax expense related to the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company.  
 Net Loss (Income)    Our net loss totaled $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net income of $21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $24.2 million decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributed to the $43.1 million gain, net of the related $20.2 million tax expense, associated with the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, interest expense increased $4.1 million and deferred compensation and board compensation expenses increased $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense increased in relation to the June 2016 debt refinancing. Deferred compensation and board compensation expenses increased with the rise in stock price combined with the May 2016 stock options granted to the members of the board of directors. Income tax expense declined $2.2 million, which partially offset the increase in interest expense and deferred compensation and board compensation expenses.   
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA    EBITDA totaled $11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

A reconciliation of Net   (Loss)   Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):  

(1)   
 
 EBITDA is defined as income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to net income (loss). See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures  for further information regarding EBITDA.    

(2)   
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) non-recurring events, (ii) option expense related to awards to the board of directors and (iii) equity method investment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures  for further information regarding EBITDA.    

Outstanding Share Data 
 As of November 14, 2016, there were 19,581,266 shares of common stock of GWRI outstanding and options to acquire an additional 372,422 shares of common stock of GWRI outstanding. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to: 

fund operating costs;     

fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;     

pay dividends;     

make debt and interest payments; and     

invest in new and existing ventures.     

 Our utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited; such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we have one notable near-term cash expenditure obligation related to an estimated $1.7 million tax liability associated with the GWRC merger. We have no notable near-term debt obligations. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months. 
   In March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. With the completion of the merger of GWRC into the Company, we intend to pay a regular monthly dividend on our common stock. On June 28, 2016 we announced a monthly  
 -39- 

dividend increase from $0.02 per share ($0.24 per share annually) to $0.022 per share ($0.264 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the   foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements.   
 The senior secured notes contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if we fall below a debt service ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of 1.25, or 1.20 for the quarters ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus depreciation, taxes, interest and other non-cash charges net of non-cash income. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments and dividend or stock repurchases. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the dividend covenant, and we believe that we will remain in compliance for at least the next twelve months. 
 Cash from Operating Activities    Cash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, and weather and seasonality.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.2 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $3.1 million change in cash from operating activities is primarily driven by an increase in losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These losses were primarily driven by the $3.2 million prepayment penalty on the retirement of our tax exempt bonds. 
 Further, operating cash flows are affected by the timing of the recording and settlement of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. 
 Cash (Used In) Provided By Investing Activities    Our net cash used in investing activities totaled $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $52.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $54.9 million change in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by $55.2 million of proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company. Additionally, capital expenditures increased $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These changes were partially offset by $2.3 million in cash proceeds received for the sale of Willow Valley during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 We continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model as service connections grow. This includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. We expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016 and 2017 as compared to recent years as a result of our decision to accelerate certain capital expenditures within our capital improvement plan related to the recently obtained Private Letter Ruling (see   Recent Events Private Letter Ruling ). Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. 
 Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities    Our net cash provided by financing activities totaled $14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $62.5 million change as compared to the $47.8 million in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change was primarily driven by the refinancing of tax exempt bonds, wherein we repaid $106.7 million in tax exempt bonds with $115.0 million in proceeds from our two series of senior secured notes, combined with the release of $8.8 million in bond reserves associated with the refinancing. Additionally, we generated $5.5 million in net proceeds from our completed U.S. IPO in May 2016. Proceeds received for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by the $2.8 million payment to settle our Sonoran acquisition liability, combined with $3.7 million in dividends paid. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by $26.5 million in dividends paid and $21.7 in loan repayments for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 associated with the retirement of the MidFirst loan.   
 Senior Secured Notes    On June 24, 2016, we closed the note purchase agreement entered into on May 20, 2016 and issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries a principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter. The proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to refinance the existing long-term tax exempt bonds, which was allowed pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the U.S. IPO.

Insurance Coverage  
 We carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 
 The application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed under  Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 28, 2016 pursuant to Rule 424(b). 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing them with timely material information relating to the Company. 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.   
 
     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

 In the ordinary course of business, we may, from time to time, be subject to various pending and threatened lawsuits in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. To our knowledge, we are not involved in any legal proceeding which is expected to have a material effect on us. 

ITEM 1A.   
 
     RISK FACTORS    

 We may   have difficulty   accomplishing   our growth strategy   within and outside   of our current   service   areas. This would cause us to rely   more   heavily   on regulatory   rate   increases   to increase   our revenues, which we may not apply   for   before   May 31, 2017 for   our utilities   that   service   approximately   98.8% of our active   service connection s . 
 Our ability   to expand our business,   both within   our current   service   areas   and into   new areas,   involves significant   risks,   including,   but not limited   to: 

not receiving or maintaining necessary regulatory permits, licenses or approvals;    

downturns in economic or population growth and development in our service areas;    

 -41- 

risks related to planning and commencing new operations,   including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water, engineering and construction difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled;     

droughts or water shortages that could increase water conservation efforts to a point that materially reduces revenue;    

regulatory restrictions or other factors that could adversely affect our access to sources of water supply;    

our potential inability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to form the relationships with developers and municipalities necessary to form strategic partnerships; and    

barriers to entry presented by existing water utilities in prospective service areas.    

 If we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, we will need to rely more heavily on regulatory rate increases to increase our revenue. However, recent Rate Decision No. 74364 stipulates that Santa Cruz and Palo Verde, which service approximately 98.8% of our active service corrections, may not file for another rate increase before May 31, 2017. See  Recent Rate Case Activity  of the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Our operations   of regulated   utilities   are currently   located   exclusively   in the state   of Arizona, which increases the impact   of local   conditions   on our results   of operations. 
 The   customers   of   our   regulated   utilities   are   currently   located   exclusively   in   the   state   of Arizona.   As a result, we   cannot   diversify   or   mitigate   the   risks   presented   by   local   regulatory,   economic,   demographic   and weather conditions   in this   area.   An adverse   change   in any of these   conditions   would therefore   affect   our profitability, results   of operations,   liquidity   and cash   flows   more   significantly   than   if   our utilities   also   operated   in other geographic   areas. 
 Our active   service   connections   are primarily   concentrated   in one water utility   and one wastewater   utility. 
 At    September 30, 2016 ,   we   had   37,009 active   service   connections,   of which approximately   98.8% are serviced   by   our   Santa   Cruz   water   utility   and   our   Palo   Verde   wastewater   utility.   Both   our   Santa   Cruz   and   Palo Verde   utilities   are   located   in   the   same   service   area.   If,   for   any   reason,   including   those   described   below   under   Any   disruption   or   problem   at   our   facilities   could   increase   our   expenses,    either   of these   utilities   are   unable   to service   this   service   area,   our ability   to conduct   our business   would be adversely   affected. 
 We face   competition   for   new service   areas   and acquisition   targets. 
 We   face   competition   from   other   water   and   wastewater   utilities   for   new   service   areas   and   with   respect   to acquisition   of   smaller   utilities.   These   competitors   consist   primarily   of   municipalities   and investor-owned   utilities seeking   expansion   opportunities.   Some of our competitors   are   larger   than   we are   and have more   resources   and access   to   capital   than   we   do.   If   we   are   unable   to   compete   effectively   for   new   service   areas   and acquisitions   of existing   utilities,   our ability   to increase   our rate   base   and revenue   could   be adversely   affected. 
 Operating   costs,   construction   costs   and costs   of providing   services   may   rise   faster   than revenue. 
 The   ability   to   increase   rates   over   time   is   dependent   upon   approval   of   rate   increases   by   utility   regulators, which   may   be   inclined,   for   political   or   other   reasons,   to   limit   rate   increases.   However, our costs   are   subject   to market   conditions   and   other   factors,   and may   increase   significantly.   The second   largest   component   of our operating   costs   after   water   production   is   made   up   of   salaries   and   wages.   These   costs   are   affected   by   the   local supply   and   demand   for   qualified   labor.   Other   large   components   of our costs   are   general   insurance,   workers  compensation   insurance,   employee   benefits   and health   insurance   costs.   These costs   may   increase disproportionately   to   rate   increases   authorized   by utility   regulators   and may   have a material   adverse   effect   on our financial   condition   and results   of operations. 
 We may   have difficulty   recruiting   and retaining   qualified   personnel,   and due to the technical   and specialized nature of our business,   our profitability   may   suffer   if   we do not have the necessary   workforce. 
   Our   plants   require   some   of our employees   to be certified   operators   of record,   a designation   requiring specialized   training   and   certification   in   water   and wastewater   systems.   As workers   with these   qualifications   retire in   the   industry,   we   may   be   unable   to   replace   them   readily   in   view   of   the   relatively   low   number   of   younger workers   that   we   believe   are   entering   the   workforce   to pursue   this   line   of work. Our operations   require   a variety   of other   technical   skills   and   specialties   in   the   areas   of engineering,   systems   analysis,   laboratory   work and equipment repair,   and   we   may   have   difficulty   recruiting   and   retaining   personnel   with   these   skills.   If   we  
 -42- 

cannot     maintain     an employee     base     with     the     skills     necessary     to     conduct     our     operations,     our efficiency,     margins     and ability     to expand our business     could     be adversely     affected.  
 Any disruption   or problem   at our facilities   could increase   our expenses. 
 A   natural   disaster   (such   as   an   earthquake,   fire   or flood)   or an act   of terrorism   could   cause   substantial   delays in   our   operations,   damage   or   destroy   our   equipment   or   facilities   and   cause   us   to   incur   additional   expenses   and lose   revenue.   The   insurance   we   maintain   against   natural   disasters   may   not   be   adequate   to   cover   our   losses   in any particular   case,   which would require   us to expend significant   resources   to replace   any destroyed   assets,   thereby materially   and adversely   affecting   our financial   condition   and prospects. 
 Our growth depends significantly   on increased   residential   and commercial   development   in our service   areas, and if   developers   or builders   are unable to complete   additional   residential   and commercial   projects,   our revenue   may   not increase. 
 The   growth   of   our   customer   base   depends   almost   entirely   on the   success   of developers   in developing residential   and   commercial   properties   within   our    Certificate   of Convenience   and Necessity    areas.   A Certificate of Convenience   and Necessity   is   a permit   issued   by the   ACC   allowing   a public service   corporation   to   serve   a   specified   area,   and   preventing   other   public   service   corporations   from   offering   the same   services   within   the   specified   area,   which   we   refer   to   as    service   areas.    Real   estate   development   is   a cyclical   industry   and   the   growth   rate   of   development,   especially   residential   development,   since   2006, both nationally   and   in   Arizona   has   been   below   historical   rates.   The sale   of, for   instance,   single   family   residences   is affected   by a number   of national   and regional   economic   factors,   including: 
   interest rates and general levels of economic output;  
   levels of activity in the local real estate market;  
   the state of domestic credit markets, mortgage standards and availability of credit ; 
   competition from other builders and other projects in the area and other states;  
   federal programs to assist home purchasers;  
   costs and availability of labor and materials;  
   government regulations affecting land development, homebuilding and mortga ge financing; 
   availability of financing for development and for home purchasers;  
   changes in the income tax treatment of real property ownership;  
   unexpected increases in development costs;  
   increased commute times and fuel costs that may adversely  affect the desirability of outlying suburbs; 
   availability of, among other things, other utilities, adequate transportation and school facilities; and  
   environmental problems with such land.  
 While   many   developers   presently   hold   necessary   zoning   approvals,   land   development   within   our service areas   could   also   be   affected   by   changes   in governmental   policies,   including,   but not limited   to, governmental policies   to   restrict   or   control   development.   This may   include,   for   example,   actions   by the   local   school   districts   to restrict   admissions   to   local   schools   because   of inadequate   classroom   space   or, because   of other   problems,   such as failure   by   local   municipalities   to   approve   plats   for   the   development.   An   increase   in current   residential   foreclosure rates   or a deep or prolonged   slowdown of the   development   process   and the   related   absorption   rate   within the various   developments   in   our   service   areas   because   of   any   or   all   of   the   foregoing   could   materially   and adversely affect   growth of our customer   base   and the   generation   of revenue. 
 Many   national   builders   and   developers   in   our   service   areas   own or control   substantial   amounts   of the developable   land   in   these   areas.   There   can be no assurance   that   these   builders   and developers   have the   financial capability   to   continue   and   complete   their   developments.   Moreover,   given   that   there   are   limited   restrictions   on the ability   of   developers   to   sell   parcels   (or   portions   thereof),   developers   may   continue   to   transfer   ownership   of parcels   (or   portions   thereof)   within   our   service   areas   to other   developers   and homebuilders   and others   prior   to completion of development, who may then sell to, among others, ultimate homeowners. There can   be   no assurance   that   any   subsequent   owners   will   have   the   financial   capabilities   to   complete   development   of any land   so acquired. 
 A deep or prolonged   slowdown of the development   process   and growth rate   within the various   developments   in our service   areas   could materially   and adversely   affect   the growth of our customer   base. 
 -43- 

Development     in     our     service     areas     is     also     contingent     upon construction     or acquisition     of major     public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities,     street     lighting     and     local     in-tract     improvements     (e.g.,     site     grading).     Many     of     these     improvements     are built     by     municipalities     with     public     financing,     and     municipal     resources     and     access     to     capital     may     not     be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. If municipalities, developers, builders   or homeowners     are     unable,     financially     or otherwise,     to make     the     improvements     necessary     to complete     new residential     or     commercial     developments,     our potential     revenue     growth from     new water     and wastewater connections     within     such developments     would be reduced.  
 New   or stricter   regulatory   standards   or other   governmental   actions   could increase   our regulatory   compliance and operating   costs,   which could cause our profitability   to suffer,   particularly   if   we are unable to increase   our rates   to offset   such costs. 
 In   Arizona,   water   and   wastewater   utilities   are   subject   to   regulation   by   water,   environmental,   public   utility and   health and   safety regulators, and   we   are   required to   obtain   environmental permits from   governmental agencies   in   order   to   operate   our facilities.   Regulations   relate   to, among   other   things,   standards   and criteria   for drinking   water   quality   and for   wastewater   discharges,   customer   service   and service   delivery   standards,   waste disposal   and   raw   groundwater   abstraction   limits   and rates   and charges   for   our regulated   services.   There   may   be instances   in   the   future   when we are   not in or cannot   achieve   compliance   with new and evolving   laws, regulations and permits without incurring additional operating costs. For example, in 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection   Agency   ( EPA )   implemented   a   new arsenic   maximum   contaminant   level,   which effectively   required the   installation   and operation   of costly   arsenic   treatment   systems   at   many   of our water   production   facilities. 
 Our   costs   of   complying   with   current   and   future   governmental   laws   and   regulations   could   adversely   affect our   business   or   results   of operations.   If   we fail   to comply   with these   laws, regulations   or permits,   we could   be fined   or   otherwise   sanctioned   by regulators   and our operations   could   be curtailed   or shut   down. We may   also   be exposed   to   product   liability   or   breach   of   contract   claims   by third   parties   resulting   from   our noncompliance.   These laws   and   regulations   are   complex   and   change   frequently,   and these   changes   may   cause   us to incur   costs   in connection   with the   remediation   of actions   that   were lawful   when they   were taken. 
 We   may   incur   higher   compliance   or   remediation   costs   than   expected   in   any particular   period   and may   not be able   to   pass   those   increased   costs   along   to   our   customers   immediately   through   rate   increases   or   at   all.   This   is because   we   must   obtain   regulatory   approval   to increase   our rates,   which can be time-consuming   and costly   and our requests   for   increases   may   not be approved   in part   or in full. 
 We   are   required   to   test   our   water   quality   for   certain   parameters   and   potential   contaminants   on   a   regular basis.   If   the   test   results   indicate   that   parameters   or   contaminants   exceed   allowable   limits,   we   may   be   required either   to   commence   treatment   to   remedy   the   water   quality   or   to   develop   an   alternate   water   source.   Either   of these outcomes   may   be   costly,   and   there   can   be   no   assurance   that   the   regulatory   authorities   would   approve   rate increases   to   recover   these   additional   compliance   costs.   In   addition,   by the   time   that   test   results   are   available, contaminated   water   may   have   been   provided   to customers,   which may   result   in liability   for   us and damage   our reputation. 
 In   addition,   governments   or   government   agencies   that   regulate   our operations   may   enact   legislation   or adopt new requirements   that   could   have an adverse   effect   on our business,   including: 

restricting ownership or investment;    

providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government through condemnation or similar proceedings;    

providing for changes to water and wastewater quality standards;    

requiring cancellation or renegotiation of, or unilateral changes to, agreements relating to our provision of water and wastewater services;    

changing regulatory or legislative emphasis on water conservation in comparison to other goals and initiatives;    

promoting an increase of competition among water companies within our designated service areas;    

requiring the provision of water or wastewater services at no charge or at reduced prices;    

restricting the ability to terminate services to customers whose accounts are in arrears;    

restricting the ability to sell assets or issue securities;    

adversely changing tax, legal or regulatory requirements, including environmental requirements and the imposition of additional requirements and costs on our operations, including but not limited to changes adopted in response to regulatory measures to address global climate change;    

 -44- 

changes in the charges applied to raw water abstraction;     

changes in rate making policies; or    

restrictions relating to water use and supply, including restrictions on use, increased offsetting groundwater replenishment obligations, changes to the character of groundwater rights and settlement of Native American claims.    

 We may   not be permitted   to increase   our rates,   which may   necessitate   a reduction   of our capital   investments and operating   costs. 
 Our utility subsidiaries are regulated as public service corporations by the ACC. Our utility subsidiaries file general rate cases for rates they charge for services which are established   by   the   ACC   in accordance   with Arizona   law, which grants   considerable discretion   to   the   ACC.   If   requested   rate   increases   are   not allowed,   we may   have to reduce   our   costs   of   capital   and   operating   costs.   The   members   of   the   ACC   are selected   by   the   voters   in   statewide   elections   and are   often   responsive   to complaints   by ratepayers   about   proposed rate   increases.   Moreover,   even if   the   ACC   ultimately   agrees   that   some   rate relief   is necessary,   the   relief   can   only   be   obtained   after   a formal   and lengthy   proceeding   before   the   ACC.   There   can be no assurance   that   rate   increases   we request   would be approved   by the ACC. 
 The operations of our utility subsidiaries are subject to other various federal, state and local laws, regulations   and   ordinances,   including   without   limitation,   the   jurisdiction   of the   Arizona   Department   of Environmental   Quality,   Arizona   Department   of   Water   Resources,   City   of   Maricopa,   Arizona,   City of Casa Grande,   Arizona,   Maricopa,   Pinal   and   Mohave   Counties,   EPA,   the   Maricopa   Association   of   Governments   and the   Central   Arizona   Association   of Governments.   Existing   laws, regulations   and ordinances   can be amended,   or new laws, regulations   or ordinances   may   be enacted,   and the   requirements   of compliance   may   change.   Continued benefits   we   receive   under   existing   laws   can   be   withdrawn   or   become   unavailable   or   more   costly.   In   addition, enforcement   practice   may   become   more   stringent.   As   a   result,   governmental   regulatory   action   and   changes   in law   could   adversely   affect   our   financial   condition   and   results   of   operations   if   we   face   delays   and difficulties   in obtaining   approval   to   raise   rates,   and   if   there   is   a   significant   gap   between   the   timing   of   increased   expenses   and our   ability   to   recover   those   expenses,   or if   we are   unable   to obtain   approval   to recover   expenses,   our profitability, results   of operations,   liquidity   and cash   flows   would be adversely   affected. 
 Changes to environmental   and other   regulation   may   require   us to alter   our existing   treatment   facilities   or build   additional   facilities. 
 To   comply   with federal,   state   and local   environmental   laws, our existing   facilities   may   need to be altered   or replaced.   Altered   and new facilities   and other   capital   improvements   must   be constructed   and operated in accordance   with   multiple   requirements,   including,   in   certain   cases,   an   Aquifer   Protection   Permit   issued   by   the Arizona   Department   of   Environmental   Quality,   Arizona   Pollution   Discharge   Elimination   System   permits   from the   Arizona   Department   of   Environmental   Quality   and   an   air   quality   permit   from   Maricopa   or   Pinal   Counties. The   provision   of   potable   water   is   subject   to, among   others,   the   requirements   of the   federal   Safe   Drinking   Water Act,   and   effluent   from   wastewater   treatment   facilities   must   comply   with other   requirements.   Regulated contaminants   and   associated   maximum   contaminant   levels   may   change   over   time,   requiring   us to alter   or build additional   treatment   facilities.   We are   also   subject   to regulation   as an employer,   property   owner and business operator   in   the   State   of   Arizona.   Failure   by   us   to   observe   the   conditions   and   comply   with   the   requirements   of these   permits   and   other   applicable   laws   and   regulations   could   result   in delays,   additional   costs,   fines   and other adverse   consequences   up to and including   inability   to proceed   with development   in our service   areas. 
 We are subject   to environmental   risks   that   may   subject   us to clean-up   costs   or litigation   that   could adversely affect   our business,   operating   results,   financial   condition   and prospects. 
   Under   various   federal   and   state   environmental   laws,   regulations,   ordinances   and   other   requirements,   a current   or previous   owner or operator   of real   property   or a facility   may   be liable   for   the   costs   of removal, remediation   or   containment   of   hazardous   or toxic   substances   on, under,   in or released   from   such property.   These liabilities   are   not   limited   to   a   potential   effect   on our water   supply   and include,   but are   not limited   to, liabilities associated with   air, soil, or   groundwater contamination at any   real   estate or   facilities we   own   or   operate, including   liabilities   assumed   in   an   acquisition   of another   utility.   Environmental   laws often   impose   liability regardless   of   whether   the   owner or operator   knew of or was responsible   for   the   presence   of the   hazardous   or toxic substances.   Although we currently   conduct   environmental   screening   assessments   on new properties   that we propose   to   acquire   or   use   to   identify   significant   sources   of   contaminants   on surrounding   properties,   these assessments   are   not   comprehensive,   nor have they   been conducted   for   all   of the   property   owned or used by us. As a   result,   hazardous   or   toxic   substances   may   exist   at   properties   owned   or   used   by   us.   If   hazardous   or toxic substances   are   discovered   at   real   property   or   facilities   owned   or   used   by   us   (including   a   landfill   owned   by another   party   that   is   used   by   us   for   disposal   of   hazardous   substances),   we   could   incur   significant   remediation

costs,     liability     exposure     or litigation     expenses     that     could     adversely     affect     our profitability,     results     of operations, liquidity     and cash     flows.  
 Any failure   of our network of water and wastewater   pipes   and water reservoirs   could result   in losses   and damages   that   may   affect   our financial   condition   and reputation. 
 Our   utilities   distribute   water   and   collect   wastewater   through   an   extensive   network   of   pipes   and   store   water in   reservoirs   located   across   our service   areas.   A failure   of major   pipes   or reservoirs   could   result   in injuries   and property   damage   for   which   we   may   be   liable.   The   failure   of   major   pipes   and   reservoirs   may   also   result   in   the need   to   shut   down some   facilities   or parts   of our network   in order   to conduct   repairs.   Any failures   and shutdowns may   limit   our   ability   to supply   water   in sufficient   quantities   to customers   and to meet   the   water   and wastewater delivery   requirements   prescribed   by   applicable   utility   regulators,   which   would   adversely   affect   our financial condition,   results   of operations,   cash   flow, liquidity   and reputation. 
 We rely   on information   technology   systems   to assist   with the management   of our business   and customer relationships.   A disruption   of these   systems   could adversely   affect   our business   and operations. 
 Our   information   technology   systems   and   the   information   technology   functions   that   are   outsourced   to the FATHO M  TM  business,   which   we   previously   owned,   are   an   integral   part   of   our   business.   For   example, FATHO M  TM    systems   allow   us   to   read   water   meters   remotely,   identify   high   water   usage   and   identify   water   theft from   disconnected   meters.   FATHO M  TM  systems   also   provide   contracted   services   and   back-office   technologies and   systems   to   bill   our   customers,   provide   customer   service,   manage   certain   financial   records   and   track   assets and   accounts   receivable   collections.   A   disruption   of   our   information   technology   systems   or the   FATHO M  TM  systems   could   significantly   limit   our   ability   to   manage   and   operate   our business   efficiently,   which in turn   could cause   our business   to suffer   and cause   our results   of operations   to be reduced. 
 Further,   our   information   technology   systems   and the   FATHO M  TM    systems   are   vulnerable   to damage   or interruption   from: 
    power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures; 
   operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;  
   physical and electronic loss of customer data or security breaches, misappropri ation and similar events; 
   computer viruses;  
   intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and  
   fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  
 Damages   or   interruptions   to   our   information   technology   systems   or   the   FATHO M  TM    systems   may   result   in physical   and   electronic   loss   of   customer   or   financial   data,   security   breaches,   misappropriation   and similar   events. These   issues   could   prevent   us   from   issuing   billings   timely,   which could   impact   revenue,   or could   negatively impact   the   efficient   operations   of the   business,   resulting   in additional   costs.   The lack   of redundancy   for   some   of our   IT   systems   or   the   FATHO M  TM    systems,   including   billing   systems,   could   exacerbate   the   impact   of   any   of   the foregoing   events. 
 Our utilities   business   is   subject   to seasonal   fluctuations   and other   weather-related   conditions,   such as droughts, which could adversely   affect   the supply   of and demand for   our services   and our results   of operations. 
 We depend on an adequate   water   supply   to meet   the   present   and future   needs   of our customers.   Whether we have   an   adequate   water   supply   depends   upon   a   variety   of   factors,   including   underground   water   supply   from which   groundwater   is   pumped,   the   rate   at   which it   is   recharged   by rainfall   and snowpack and changes   in the amount   of   water   used   by   our   customers.   In   particular,   the   arid   western   U.S.   region,   which   includes   our   present and   potential   service   areas,   has been required   to deal   with general   conditions   of water   scarcity   exacerbated   by extended   periods   of drought. 
   Drought   conditions   could   interfere   with   our   sources   of   water   supply   and   could   adversely   affect   our ability   to supply   water   in   sufficient   quantities   to   our existing   and future   customers.   For example,   our utilities   have acted   in the   past   as   interim   operators   for   several   smaller   troubled   water   system s , at   the   request   of the   ACC.   In   one   such   instance,   the   onsite   well,   which was the   single   source   of water,   ran   dry due to aquifer decline.   As   a   result,   we   were   forced   to   haul   water   to   the   system   for   several   years   at   a   considerable   cost.   Any future   interruption   to   our   water   supply   or   restrictions   on   water   usage   during   drought   conditions   or   other   legal limitations   on   water   use   could   result   in   decreased   customer   billing   and lower   revenues   or higher   expenses   that   we would not be able   to recoup   without   prior   regulatory   approval   for   a rate   increase,   which may   not be granted. See   We   may   not   be   permitted   to    
 -46- 

increase     our rates,     which may     necessitate     a reduction     of our capital     investments and     operating     costs.      These     conditions     could     also     lead     to     increases     in     capital     expenditures     needed     to build infrastructure to     secure     alternative water     sources.     Furthermore, customers may     use     less     water     even     after     a drought     has ended because     of conservation     patterns     developed     during     the     drought.     Population     growth could also decline     under     drought     conditions     as     individuals     and     businesses     move     out of the     area     or elect     not to relocate     there. Lower water     use for     any reason     could     lead     to lower     revenue.  
 Demand   for   water   is   seasonal   and varies   with temperature   and rainfall   levels.   If   temperatures   during   the typically   warmer   months   are   cooler   than   normal,   or   if   there   is   more   rainfall   than   normal,   the   demand   for   our water   may   decrease,   which   would   adversely   affect   our   profitability,   results   of   operations,   liquidity   and   cash flows.   Consequently,   the   results   of operations   for   one quarter   are   not necessarily   indicative   of results   for   future quarters   or the   full   year. 
 Funds   from   our infrastructure   coordination   and financing   agreements   are dependent   on development activities   by developers   which we do not control   and are also   subject   to certain   regulatory   requirements. 
 In the   past,   we extended   water   and wastewater   infrastructure   financing   to developers   and builders   through infrastructure   coordination   and   financing   agreements.   These   agreements   are   contracts   with developers   or builders in which we coordinate   and fund the   construction   of water,   wastewater   and recycled   water   facilities   that will be owned   and   operated   by   our   regulated   subsidiaries   in   advance   of   completion   of   developments   in   the   area.   Our investment   can   be   considerable,   as   we   phase-in   the   construction   of   facilities   in accordance   with a regional   master plan,   as   opposed   to   a   single   development.   Developers   and   builders   pay   us   agreed-upon   fees   upon   the   occurrence of   specified   development   events   for   their   development   projects.   The   ACC   requires us   to   record   a   portion   of   the   funds   we   receive   under   infrastructure   coordination   and financing   agreements   as  contributions   in   aid   of   construction,    which   are   funds   or property   provided   to a utility   under   the   terms   of a collection   main   extension   agreement   and/or   service   connection   tariff,   the   value   of which are   not refundable. Amounts   received   as contributions   in aid   of construction   reduce   our rate   base   once expended   on utility   plants. 
 The   developer   is   not   required   to   pay   the   bulk   of   the   agreed-upon   fees   until   a development   receives   platting approval.   Accordingly,   we   cannot   always   accurately   predict   or   control   the   timing   of   the   collection   of   our   fees.   If a   developer   encounters   difficulties,   such   as   during   a real   estate   market   downturn, that   result   in a complete   or partial   abandonment   of   the   development   or   a   significant   delay   in   its   completion,   we   will   have planned,   built   and invested   in   infrastructure   that   will   not be supported   by development   and will   not generate   either   payments   under the   applicable   infrastructure   coordination   and   financing   agreement   or   cash   flows   from   providing   services.   As a result,   our return   on our investment   and cash   flow stream   could   be adversely   affected. 
 In   August   2013,   we   entered   into   a   settlement   agreement   with   ACC   staff,   the Residential   Utility   Consumers   Office,   the   City of Maricopa   and other   the   parties   to a rate   case,   which established the   policy   by   which   infrastructure   coordination   and financing   agreement   fees   will   be treated   going forward.   The settlement   also   prohibits   us from   entering   into   new infrastructure   coordination   and financing   agreements.   In February   2014, the   rate   case   proceedings   were completed   and the   ACC   issued Rate Decision   No.   74364,   approving   the   settlement   agreement.   See  Management s   Discussion   and Analysis   of Financial   Condition   and Results   of Operations Recent   Rate Case Activity    for   additional   information. 
 Risks associated   with the collection,   treatment   and disposal   of wastewater   and the operation   of water utilities may   impose   significant   costs   that   may   not be covered   by insurance,   which could result   in increased   insurance premiums. 
 The   wastewater   collection,   treatment   and disposal   operations   of our utilities   are   subject   to substantial regulation   and   involve   significant   environmental   risks.   If   collection   or   sewage   systems   fail,   overflow   or do not operate   properly,   untreated   wastewater   or   other   contaminants   could   spill   onto nearby   properties   or into   nearby streams   and   rivers,   potentially   causing   damage   to   persons   or   property,   injury   to   the   environment   including aquatic   life   and economic   damages,   which may   not be recoverable   in rates.   This risk   is   most   acute   during   periods of   substantial   rainfall   or   flooding,   which are   the   main   causes   of sewer   overflow   and system   failure.   Liabilities resulting   from   such damage   could   adversely   and materially   affect   our business,   results   of operations   and financial condition.   Moreover,   in   the   event   that   we are   deemed   liable   for   any damage   caused   by overflow,   losses   might   not be   covered   by   insurance   policies,   and   such   losses   may   make   it   difficult   to secure   insurance   in the   future   at acceptable   insurance   premium   rates.   Similarly,   any related   business   interruption   or other   losses   might   not be covered   by   insurance   policies,   which   would   also   make   it   difficult   for   us to secure   insurance   in the   future   at acceptable   insurance   premium   rates. 
   We   may   also   incur   liabilities   under   environmental   laws and regulations   requiring   investigations   and cleanup of   environmental   contamination   at   our   properties   or at   off-site   locations   where there   have been adverse environmental impacts. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations   in   the   future,   could   result   in significant   costs,   and could    
 -47- 

adversely     affect     our financial     condition, results     of     operations,     cash     flow     and liquidity.     Such remediation     losses     may     not be covered     by insurance     policies and may     make     it     difficult     for     us to secure     insurance     in the     future     at     acceptable     insurance     premium     rates.  
 Inadequate   water and wastewater   supplies   could have a material   adverse   effect   upon our ability   to achieve   the customer   growth necessary   to increase   our revenues. 
 In   many   areas   of   Arizona   (including   certain   areas   that   we   service),   water   supplies   are   limited   and, in some cases,   current   usage   rates   exceed   sustainable   levels   for   certain   water   resources.   As   discussed   above, we currently rely   predominantly   (and   are   likely   to continue   to rely)   on the   pumping   of groundwater   and the   generation   and delivery   of recycled   water   for   non-potable   uses   to meet   future   demands   in our service   areas.   At present, groundwater   (and   recycled   water   derived   from   groundwater)   is   the   primary   water   supply   available   to us. 
 We   do   not   currently   anticipate   any short-term   concerns   with physical,   legal,   or continuous   availability   issues in   our   service   areas.   Regardless,   the   supply   of   groundwater   in Central   Arizona,   while   considerable,   is   also ultimately   finite,   closely   regulated   and   geographically   limited.   In   areas   where   we   have not applied   for   a  Designation   of   Assured   Water   Supply,    which   is   a   decision   and   order   issued   by   the   director   of   the   Arizona Department   of   Water   Resources   designating   a private   water   company   provider   as having   an adequate   water supply,   we have not performed   hydrological   studies   or modeling   to evaluate   the   amount   of groundwater likely to be   available   to   meet   present   and   expected   future   demands.   Insofar   as   we   intend   to rely   on the   pumping   of groundwater   and   the   generation   and   delivery   of   recycled   water   to   meet   future   demands   in   our   current   service areas,   our   ability   and/or   the   ability   of   developers   inside   of   our   service   areas   to   meet   regulatory   requirements   and to demonstrate assured and adequate water supplies is essential to the continued growth of our service connections   and our capacity   to supply   water   to our customers. 
 Insufficient   availability   of water   or wastewater   treatment   capacity   could   materially   and adversely   affect   our ability   to   provide   for   expected   customer   growth   necessary   to   increase   revenues.   We continuously   look for   new sources   of   water   to   augment   our   reserves   in   our   service   areas,   but have not yet   obtained   surface   water   rights.   Our ability   to   obtain   such   rights   may   depend   on   factors   beyond   our control,   such as the   future   availability   of Colorado River   water   supplies.   We   also   plan   to   construct   facilities   and   obtain   the   necessary   permits   to recharge   recycled water   to   stretch   and   augment   our   existing   and   planned   future   water   supplies,   but do not yet   have this   capability   in all   of   our   service   areas.   As   a   result,   it   is   possible   that,   in   the   future,   we   will   not   be   able   to   obtain   sufficient   water or water   supplies   to increase   customer   growth necessary   to increase   or even maintain   our revenues. 
 There is   no guaranteed   source   of water. 
 Our   ability   to   meet   the   existing   and   future   water   demands   of   our   customers   depends   on   an   adequate   supply of   water.   Regulatory   restrictions   on   the   use   of groundwater   and the   development   of groundwater   wells,   lack   of available   water   rights,   drought,   overuse   of local   or regional   sources   of water,   protection   of threatened   species or habitats   or other   factors,   including   climate   change,   may   limit   the   availability   of ground or surface   water. 
 As stated   above, our primary   source   of water   is   pumping   of groundwater   from   aquifers   within service   areas. In the event that our wells cannot meet customer demand, we can purchase water from surrounding municipalities,   agencies   and   other   utilities.   However,   the   cost   of   purchasing   water   is   typically   more   expensive than   producing   it.   Furthermore,   these   alternative   sources   may   not always   have an adequate   supply   to sell   to us. 
 To   date,   we   have been able   to produce   enough water   to meet   current   customer   requirements.   However, no assurance   can   be   given   that   we   will   be   able   to produce   or purchase   enough water   to fully   satisfy   future   customer demand.   We   can   make   no   guarantee   that   we   will   always   have   access   to   an   adequate   supply   of   water   that   will meet   all   quality   standards,   or that   the   cost   of water   will   not adversely   affect   our operating   results. 
 If   we are   unable   to access   adequate   water   supplies,   we may   be unable   to satisfy   all   customer   demand, which could   result   in rationing.   Rationing   may   have an adverse   effect   on cash   flow from   operations. 
 Water   shortages   may   affect   us in a variety   of ways. For example,   water   shortages   could: 

adversely affect water supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;    

adversely affect operating costs;    

increase the risk of contamination to water systems due to the inability to maintain sufficient pressure;    

 -48- 

increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet   the needs of customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water; and     

result in regulatory authorities refusing to approve new service areas if an adequate water supply cannot be demonstrated, and restrictions on new customer connections may be imposed in existing service areas if there is not sufficient water.    

 We   may   or   may   not   be   able   to   recover   increased   operating   and construction   costs   as a result   of water shortages   on a timely   basis,   or at   all,   for   our regulated   systems   through   the   rate   setting   process. 
 The nature of our business   exposes   us to various   liability   claims,   which may   exceed   the level   of our insurance coverage   and thereby   not be reimbursed   fully   by insurance   proceeds,   or not be covered   by our insurance   at all, and may   also   make   it   difficult   for   us to obtain   insurance   coverage   at affordable   rates. 
 In recent   years,   societal   factors   have resulted   in increased   litigation   and escalating   monetary   claims   against industries   and employers.   Although the national   insurance   market   currently   provides insurance   coverage at affordable   premiums,   there   is   no   guarantee   this   will   continue   or   that   we   will   continue   to   be   able   to   obtain coverage   against   catastrophic   claims   and   losses.   While   we   may   self-insure   for   some   risks   in the   future,   should   an uninsured   or underinsured   loss   occur,   we may   be unable   to meet   our obligations   as they   become   due. 
 The operation   of our utilities   is   subject   to the   normal   risks   of occupancy   as well   as the additional   risks of receiving,   processing,   treating   and   disposing   of   water   and   waste   materials.   As a safeguard,   we currently   maintain general   liability   and   workers    compensation   insurance   coverage,   subject   to deductibles   at   levels   we believe   are sufficient   to   cover   future   claims   made   during   the   respective   policy   periods.   However, we may   be exposed   to multiple   claims,   including   workers    compensation   claims,   that   do   not   exceed   our deductibles,   and, as a result,   we could   incur   significant   out-of-pocket   costs   that   could   materially   adversely   affect   our business,   financial   condition and   results   of   operations.   In   addition,   the   cost   of insurance   policies   may   increase   significantly   upon renewal   of those   policies   as   a   result   of   general   rate   increases   for   the   type   of   insurance   we   carry   as   well   as   our   historical experience   and experience   in our industry.   Our future   claims   may   exceed   the   coverage   level   of our insurance,   and insurance   may   not   continue   to   be   available   on economically   reasonable   terms,   or at   all.   If   we are   required   to pay significantly   higher   premiums   for   insurance,   are   not able   to maintain   insurance   coverage   at   affordable   rates   or if we   must   pay   amounts   in   excess   of   claims   covered   by our insurance,   we could   experience   higher   costs   that   could materially   adversely   affect   our business,   financial   condition   and results   of operations. 
 Contamination   of the water supplied   by us may   result   in disruption   in our services,   loss   of credibility,   lower demand for   our services   and potential   liability   that   could adversely   affect   our business   and financial condition. 
 Our   water   supplies   are   subject   to contamination,   including   contamination   from   compounds,   chemicals   in groundwater   systems,   pollution   resulting   from   man-made   sources   (such   as perchlorate   and methyl   tertiary   butyl ether),   and possible   biological   terrorist   attacks.   Contamination   of water   sources   can lead   to human   death   and illness,   damage   to natural   resources   and other   parts   of the   environment   and cause   other   harms.   Among other things,   if   we   are   found   to   be   liable   for   consequences   of water   contamination   arising   out of human   exposure   to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other damage, we would be subject to civil or criminal enforcement   actions,   litigation   and other   proceedings   or clean   up obligations.   Further,   our insurance   policies   may not apply   or be sufficient   to cover   the   costs   of these   claims,   which could   be significant. 
 Cleaning   up   water   sources   can   be   very   expensive   and   if   we   are   required   to   do   so,   it   could   have   a   material and   adverse   effect   on   our   business,   operating   results   and financial   condition.   In the   event   that   our water   supply   is contaminated,   we   may   have   to   interrupt   or   stop   the   use   of   that   water   supply   until   we are   able   to treat   the   water   or to substitute   the   supply   of water   from   another   water   source,   including,   in some   cases,   through   the   purchase of water   from   a supplier.   We may   incur   significant   costs   in order   to warn consumers   and to treat   the   contaminated source   through   expansion   of current   treatment   facilities   or development   of new treatment   methods.   Using a new water   source   is   generally   associated   with   increased   costs   compared   to   an   existing   water   source   and, as indicated above, purchasing   water   is   typically   more   expensive   than   obtaining   the   water   from   other   means.   If   we are unable to   treat   or   substitute   our   water   supply   in   a   cost-effective   manner,   our   financial   condition,   results   of operations, cash   flow,   liquidity   and   reputation   may   be   adversely   affected.   We   may   not   be   able   to   recover   costs   associated with   treating   contaminated   water   or   developing   new   sources   of supply   through   the   rate   setting   process   or through insurance. 
 We depend on an adequate   supply   of electricity   and chemicals   for   the delivery   of our water, and an interruption   in the supply   of these   inputs   or increases   in their   prices   could adversely   affect   our results   of operations.

We     rely     on     purchased     electrical     power to operate     the     wells     and pumps     that     are     needed     in order     to supply potable     and     recycled     water     to our customers.     An extended     interruption     in power supply     that     we cannot     remediate through     the     use     of     backup     generators     could     adversely     affect     our ability     to continue     these     operations.     Electrical power,     which     represented     approximately     6.3%     of     our     total     operating     expenses     in fiscal year 2015, is     a significant and     potentially     vol  atile     operating     expense.     Electrical     power     costs     are     beyond     our     control     and can increase unpredictably     in substantial     amounts.     Under these     circumstances,     our cash     flows     between     our general     rate     case filings     and     our     earnings     may     be     adversely     affected     until     the     ACC     has authorized     a rate     increase.  
 In   addition,   we   require   bulk   supplies   of chemicals   for   water   and wastewater   treatment,   and if   we were to suffer   an   interruption   of   supply   that   we   cannot   replace   quickly,   we   might   not   be   able   to perform   these   functions adequately.   Some chemicals   are   available   from   a single   source   or a limited   number   of sources. Chemical costs represented   approximately   2.1% of   our   total   operating   expenses   in   fiscal year 2015 (excluding   a one-time   gain   on regulatory   order ) . 
 Doing business   in jurisdictions   other   than Arizona may   present   unforeseen   regulatory,   legal   and operational challenges   that   could impede   or delay   our operations   or adversely   affect   our profitability. 
 We may   decide   to pursue   growth opportunities   in states   other   than   Arizona.   Other   states   may present substantially   different   regulatory   frameworks,   and we may   have difficulty   acquiring   the   necessary   approvals   and permits   or   complying   with   environmental,   health   and   safety   or   quality   standards.   In   addition,   it   may   become more   costly   or difficult   for   us to comply   with a multitude   of standards   and requirements   across   multiple   states. 
 Other   states   may   also   expose   us to new legal   precedents,   condemnation   risks   and liability   concerns   based   on state   legislation   or case   law. 
 Our   cost   structure   in   other   states   may   be   significantly   different   than   our   current   cost   structure   due   to regional   differences.   For   example,   our   cost   structure   may   be   significantly   impacted   by   differences   in labor   and energy   costs   in other   markets   and the   significant   portion   of overall   production   costs   that   they   represent. 
 If   future   acquisitions   do not achieve   sufficient   profitability   relative   to expenses   and investment,   our business and ability   to finance   our operations   could be materially   adversely   affected. 
 A typical element of a utility growth strategy is the acquisition or development of other water and wastewater   utilities.   The potential   negotiation   of future   acquisitions   and development   of new projects   could require   us to incur   significant   costs   and expose   us to significant   risks,   including: 

risks relating to the condition of assets acquired and exposure to residual liabilities of prior businesses;    

operating risks, including equipment, technology and supply problems, regulatory requirements and approvals necessary for acquisitions;    

risks that potential acquisitions may require the disproportionate attention of our senior management, which could distract them from the management of our existing business;    

risks related to our ability to retain experienced personnel of the acquired company; and    

risks that certain acquisitions may require regulatory approvals, which could be refused or delayed and which could result in unforeseen regulatory expenses or unfavorable regulatory conditions.    

 These   issues   could   have   a   material   adverse   effect   on our business   and our ability   to finance   our operations. The   businesses   and   other   assets   we   acquire   in   the   future   may   not   achieve   sufficient   revenue   or profitability   to justify   our   investment,   and   any   difficulties   we   may   encounter   in   the   integration   process   could   interfere   with   our operations and reduce operating margins. Acquisitions could   also result in dilutive   issuance of our   equity securities,   incurrence   of debt   and contingent   liabilities   and fluctuations   in quarterly   results   and expenses. 
 We are exposed   to various   risks   relating   to legal   proceedings   or claims   that   could materially   adversely   affect our operating   results. 
 We   are   a   party   to   lawsuits   in the   normal   course   of our business.   Litigation   in general   can be expensive, lengthy   and   disruptive   to   normal   business   operations.   Moreover,   the   results   of complex   legal   proceedings   are difficult   to   predict.   Responding   to   lawsuits   brought   against   us, or legal   actions   that   we may   initiate,   can often   be expensive   and time-consuming.   Unfavorable   outcomes   from   these   claims   and/or   lawsuits   could materially adversely   affect   our   business,   results   of   operations   and   financial   condition,   and we could   incur   substantial monetary   liability   and/or   be required   to change   our business   practice s . 
 -50- 

We are subject     to industrial     risks     that     could adversely     affect     our results     of operations.  
 The   operations   of   our water   and wastewater   treatment   plants   involve   physical,   chemical   and biological processes   and   the   use   of pumps,   generators   and other   industrial   equipment.   As a result,   our operations   are   subject to   various   industrial   risks,   including   chemical   spills,   discharges   or releases   of toxic   or hazardous   substances   or gases,   effects   resulting   from   confined   operating   spaces,   fires,   explosions,   mechanical   failures,   storage tank leaks and electric   shock. These risks   can result   in personal   injury,   loss   of life,   catastrophic   damage   to or destruction   of property   and equipment   or environmental   damage   and related   legal   proceedings,   including   those   commenced   by regulators,   neighbors   or   others.   They   may   also   result   in   an   unanticipated   interruption   or   suspension   of our operations   and   the   imposition   of liability.   The loss   or shutdown over   an extended   period   of operations   at   any of our   treatment   facilities   or   any   losses   relating   to   these   risks   could   have   a   material   adverse   impact   on our profitability,   results   of operations,   liquidity   and cash   flows. 
 If   the general   public   perceives   recycled   water to be unsafe, we will   have difficulty   executing   our business   plan and could face   a loss   of revenue. 
 Our   Total   Water   Management   model   emphasizes   the   maximum   use   of recycled   water   for   non-potable purposes.   To   implement   this   model,   we   cultivate   relationships   with   developers,   municipalities   and   members   of the   communities   we   serve   and   focus   on   educating   them   regarding   the   benefits   and safety   of recycled   water.   If   the recycled   water   supplied   to   customers   is   contaminated,   either   as a result   of terrorism,   system   failure,   pipeline   or other   causes,   public   perception   regarding   the   safety   of recycled   water   would likely   suffer,   regardless   of whether we are   at   fault   and potentially   even if   the   contaminated   water   was supplied   by another   person.   For example,   if groundwater   contamination   occurs   as   a   result   of   discharge   of    gray   water    (e.g.,   used sink   or laundry   water)   into the   aquifer,   the   public   could   confuse   that   with recycled   water   and attribute   environmental   harm   to our system. Public   perception   of an unsafe   water   supply   would harm   our business,   particularly   with respect   to our ability   to implement   water   recycling   as a key element   of our business   strategy. 
 We face   risks   associated   with the design,   construction   and operation   of our systems   that   may   adversely   affect our business   and financial   condition. 
 We   are   responsible   for   the   design,   construction,   installation   and   maintenance   of our water   treatment, reclamation   and   distribution   systems.   We   could   be   adversely   affected   by   a   failure   to complete   our construction projects   on   time   or   on   budget,   and   a   substantial   delay   in   the   progress   of   construction   due   to   adverse   weather, work   stoppages,   shortages   of   materials,   non-issuances   of   permits,   nonperformance   of suppliers   or contractors   or other   factors   could   result   in a material   increase   in the   overall   cost   of such projects. 
 We   cannot   guarantee   that   our   systems   will   operate   as   designed   or   be   free   from   defects.   The failure   of our systems   to   operate   properly   could   cause   significant   public   harm.   Any   defects   in our systems   or significant reliability,   quality   or   performance   problems   with   respect   to   our systems   or services   could   have a number   of negative   effects   on our profitability,   results   of operations,   liquidity   and cash   flows,   including: 

loss of revenues;    

diversion of management and development resources and the attention of engineering personnel;    

significant customer relations problems;    

increased repair, support and insurance expenses;    

adverse regulatory actions; and    

legal actions for damages by our customers, including but not limited to damages based on commercial losses and effects on human health.    

 Our water and wastewater   systems   are subject   to condemnation   by governmental   authorities,   which may   result in the receipt   of less   than the fair   market   value   of our assets   and a loss   of revenue   from   our operation. 
 Arizona   law   provides   for   the   acquisition   of public   utility   property   by governmental   agencies   through   their power   of   eminent   domain,   also   known   as   condemnation.   Should   a municipality   or other   government   subdivision seek   to   acquire   our   assets   through   eminent   domain,   we   may   resist   the   acquisition.   Contesting   an exercise   of condemnation   through   eminent   domain   may   result   in   costly   legal   proceedings   and   may   divert   the   attention   of management. 
   The   assets   of   our   former   utility   subsidiaries,   Cave   Creek   Water   Co.   and   Valencia   Water   Company,   were acquired   from   us   by   municipalities   pursuant   to   condemnation   proceedings,   and   our   other   utility   subsidiaries could   be   subjects   of   such   proceedings   in    
 -51- 

the     future.     The     fair     market     value     we   receive     for     the     assets     condemned may     not     always     exceed     their     book     value.     Condemnation     also     results     in     a     loss     of     revenue     from     the     operations     of the     affected     utility     in addition     to increased     legal     costs     and diversion     of management     resources.  
 On   July   14,   2015,   we   closed   the   stipulated   condemnation   of   the   operations   and   assets   of   Valencia   Water Company with the City of Buckeye, Arizona. See  Management s   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition   and   Results   of   Operations Recent   Events Stipulated   Condemnation   of the   Operations   and Assets   of Valencia   Water   Company  for   additional   information. 
 If   we do not manage our anticipated   growth effectively,   we may   not be able   to develop   or implement   the infrastructure   necessary   to support   our operations   and could suffer   a loss   of profitability. 
 Since   our   formation   in   2003,   we   have   grown   rapidly,   with   our   total   revenues   increasing   from   $4.9   million   in 2004   to   $32.0   million   in   2015,   and   total   service   connections   increasing   from   8,113   as   of   December   31,   2004   to 37,736   as   of    September 30, 2016 .   We   have   also   expanded   geographically,   from   18   square   miles   of   service   areas in   2004   to 332 square   miles   as of  September 30, 2016 . Our growth has been driven   principally   by acquisitions   and by organic   growth resulting   from   increased   development   and service   connections   within   our existing   service   areas. 
 Although   we   may   not   be   able   to   achieve   similar   growth   or   grow   at   all,   in future   periods,   we expect   to continue   to   significantly   expand   our   facilities,   infrastructure,   research   and development,   marketing,   testing, management   and administrative   operations,   as well   as our financial   and accounting   controls.   This expansion   has placed,   and   will   continue   to   place,   strain   on our management   and administrative,   operational,   technical   and financial   infrastructure.   If   management   is   unable   to manage   growth effectively,   the   quality   of our services,   our ability   to attract   and retain   key personnel,   and our business   or prospects   could   be harmed   significantly. 
 To manage   growth effectively,   we must: 
   continue to expand our water management capacity;  
   retain key management and augment our management team;  
   continue to enhance our technology, operations and financial and management systems;  
   manage multiple relationships with our customers, re gulators, suppliers and other third parties; and 
   expand, train and manage our employee base.  
 We   may   not   be   able   to   manage   effectively   any expansion   in one or more   of these   areas,   and our failure   to do so   could   harm   our   ability   to   maintain   or   increase   revenues   and operating   results.   The expenses   incurred   in pursuing   growth   could   increase   without   a   corresponding   increase   in   our   revenue   base,   which could   decrease operating   results   and   profit   margin.   In addition,   future   growth may   require   us to make   significant   capital expenditures   or   incur   other   significant   expenses   and   may   divert   the   attention   of our personnel   from   our core business   operations,   any of which could   affect   our financial   performance   adversely. 
 Our ability to expand into new service areas and to expand current water and wastewater service depends on approval from regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals will adversely affect future growth. 
 In Arizona,   the   ACC   is   the   regulatory   authority   that oversees the formation, expansion   and ongoing operations   of water   and wastewater   utilities.   The ACC   has authority,   among   other   things,   to determine   service   areas   for   utility   providers.   In order   for   our owned utilities   to provide   water   or   wastewater   service,   they   must   obtain   a   Certificate   of Convenience   and Necessity   for   a service area   before   they   can   service   that   area.   In addition,   our owned utilities   and/or   the   developments   that   we serve   must demonstrate   to   the   Arizona   Department   of   Water   Resources   that   there   exists   a 100-year   water   supply   and obtain either   a    Certificate   of   Assured   Water   Supply,    which   is   a certificate   issued   by the   Arizona   Department   of Water Resources   evidencing   sufficient   groundwater,   surface   water   or effluent   of adequate   quality   will   be continuously available   to   satisfy   the   water   needs   of   the   proposed   use   for   at   least   one   hundred   years   and   which   applies   to   a specific   subdivision,   or a Designation   of Assured   Water   Supply, which applies   to the utility s   entire   service   area. The designation   area   is   contiguous   with the   Certificate   of Convenience   and Necessity.   Further,   our wastewater facilities   require   Arizona   Department   of   Environmental   Quality   and/or   EPA permits   that   regulate,   among   other things,   the   level   of   discharges   from   our   facilities,   the   size   of our facilities   and the   location   of our facilities.   Any inability   to   obtain   the   necessary   regulatory   approvals,   assured   water   supplies   or   environmental   permits   would limit   our ability   to expand our water   or wastewater   service   areas. 
   If we chose to expand to states other than Arizona, we may have difficulty acquiring the necessary approvals   and   permits   or   complying   with environmental,   health   and safety   or quality   standards   of such states.   See   Doing   business   in   jurisdictions   other

than     Arizona     may     present     unforeseen     regulatory,     legal     and operational challenges     that     could     impede     or delay     our operations     or adversely     affect     our profitability.   
 We do not control when and where a developer may request service within our service areas, and if this occurs outside the location and capacity of existing infrastructure, it may require significantly more capital expenditures than currently anticipated. 
 If a developer   has an infrastructure   coordination   and financing   agreement,   and/or   once a developer   has entered   into   a   service   agreement   with   our   utility   subsidiary   and the   property   being   developed   has been included within   a   service   area,   the   utility   has   the   obligation   to   serve   under   the   terms   of those   agreements   and existing regulations.   Although   we   have   built   substantial   modern   infrastructure   within   these   utilities   in areas   where development   is   currently   occurring,   there   is   the   potential   that   a developer   may   request   service   in another   location within   the   service   area.   Extending/expanding   the   existing   infrastructure   to provide   service   may   result   in the   need to   make   additional,   currently   unplanned,   capital   improvements   and there   is   no guarantee   that   we may   recover   our costs   timely.   As a result,   our return   on our investment   and cash   flow stream   could   be adversely   affected. 
 We will need additional capital to grow our business, and additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. 
 Adequate   funds   to support   our growth may   not be available   when needed   or on terms   acceptable   to us. We may   need to raise   additional   funds   to support   more   rapid   expansion,   improve   our facilities   and infrastructure, develop   new   and enhanced   technologies   or respond   to evolving   regulatory   standards.   We may   experience difficulty   in   raising   the   necessary   capital   due   to   volatility   in   the   capital   markets   or increases   in the   cost   of infrastructure   finance.   Increasingly   stringent   bond   rating   standards   could   make   it   more   difficult   for   us   to   finance our   growth   by   issuing   tax-exempt   bonds   as we have in the   past.   In addition,   we require   regulatory   approval   from the ACC for some means of   raising capital, such   as   issuance of   debt by   our regulated   utilities,   and   approval   may   be   denied   or   delayed.   If   adequate   funds   are   not   available   or are   not available on   acceptable   terms,   we may   not be able   to take   advantage   of expansion   opportunities,   make   the   capital expenditures   necessary   to support   our growth or otherwise   execute   our strategic   plan. 
 Increased operating expenses associated with the expansion of our business may negatively impact our operating income. 
 Increased   operating   expenses   associated   with   any   expansion   of our business   may   negatively   impact   our income   as we, among   other   things: 
   seek    to acquire   new service   areas; 
   expand geographically    in and outside   of Arizona; 
   make    significant   capital   expenditures   to   support   our   ability   to   provide   services   in   our   existing   service areas; 
   fund development    costs   for   our system   and technology;   and 
   incur    increased   general   and administrative   expenses   as we grow. 
 As a result   of these   factors,   we may   not sustain   or increase   our profitability   on an ongoing basis. 
 Our existing indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to growth opportunities,   and we may   be unable to generate   sufficient   cash flow to satisfy   our liquidity   needs. 
 As   of    September 30, 2016 ,   we   had total   indebtedness   of $115.4 million. In addition,   we may   incur   substantial   additional indebtedness   in the   future.   Our indebtedness   could   have important   consequences,   including: 

limiting   our   ability   to   obtain   future   additional   financing   we   may   need   to   fund   future   working   capital, capital   expenditures,   acquisitions   or other   corporate   requirements;   and  

limiting,   by   the   financial   and   other   restrictive   covenants   in   our   debt   agreements,   our   ability   to   borrow additional   funds   and to pay dividends.  

Our   ability   to incur   significant   future   indebtedness   will   depend in part   on our ability   to generate   cash   flow. This   ability   is   affected   by general   economic,   financial,   competitive,   legislative,   regulatory   and other   factors   that are   beyond   our   control.   If   our business   does not generate   sufficient   cash   flow from   operations   or if   we are   unable to   borrow   money   or   otherwise   generate   funds   sufficient   to   enable   us   to   fund   our   liquidity   needs,   we   may   be unable   to   plan   for   or   respond   to   growth opportunities,   which could   adversely   affect   our operating   results   and business   prospects.

ITEM 2.   
 
          UNREG  ISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS     

 a) Sales of Unregistered Securities  
 No unregistered securities were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 b) Use of Proceeds  
 On April 27, 2016, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-209025) was declared effective by the SEC for our initial public offering pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 1,339,520 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $6.25 per share. Roth Capital Partners, LLC acted as sole manager for the offering. The aggregate offering price for shares sold in the offering was approximately $8.4 million. The offering commenced as of April 28, 2016 and did not terminate before all of the securities registered in the registration statement were sold. We raised approximately $5.5 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses of approximately $761,000 and other offering expenses of approximately $2.2 million. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates. As described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 28, 2016 pursuant to Rule 424(b) we intended to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. On June 24, 2016, we completed the refinancing of our then existing long-term tax exempt bonds. Consistent with our disclosure in the final prospectus, we did not use any of the offering proceeds to refinance the tax-exempt bonds and the proceeds will, as indicated, be allocated for general working capital and other purposes.
