1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
  Business 
  Roka Bioscience, Inc. ( Roka  or  the Company ) is initially focused on the development and commercialization of molecular assay technologies for the detection of foodborne pathogens. The Company was established in September 2009 through the acquisition of industrial testing assets and technology from Gen-Probe Incorporated, which was subsequently acquired by Hologic, Inc. (herein referred to as  Gen-Probe ). 
  The Company has limited capital resources, has experienced negative cash flows from operations and has incurred net losses since inception. The Company expects to continue to experience negative cash flows from operations and incur net losses in the near term as it devotes substantially all of its efforts on commercialization of its products and continued product development. The Company s business is subject to significant risks and its ability to successfully develop, manufacture and commercialize proprietary products is dependent upon many factors which include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties associated with the supply of molecular diagnostic instruments ( Atlas instruments ) and materials, product development, manufacturing scale-up, attracting and retaining key personnel, customer acceptance as well as competition. 
  The Company may need to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and/or debt securities in the future. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. In addition, the Company s debt agreement contains certain clauses which allow the lender to require repayment of the debt based on subjective factors regarding the Company s business and performance if considered a material adverse change by the lender.  
    
  On September 21, 2016, the Company closed a private placement of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants ("the Offering"), see Note 13 for further details.  
    
  Concentration of Suppliers 
    
  The Company relies on single source suppliers, including Gen-Probe, for certain components and materials used in its products, including its Atlas Detection Assays. Since the Company s contracts with these suppliers, including Gen-Probe, do not commit the suppliers to carry inventory or to make available any minimum quantities, the Company may be unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.  If the Company loses such suppliers, or its suppliers encounter financial hardships, the Company may not be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time consuming, may be expensive, may result in an interruption in the Company s operations and could affect the performance specifications of the Company s products. If the Company should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the quality and quantity of materials required for its products, the Company s ability to manufacture its products would be interrupted which could adversely affect sales. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Roka Bioscience, Inc. have been prepared by the Company in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting, which do not conform in all respects to the requirements of U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. The information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on March 27,   2016   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). Accordingly, these condensed notes to the unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   2015   audited financial statements and notes thereto prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The unaudited financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that are consistent with the policies used in preparing the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The condensed Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from the Company s audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted

in the United States.  The unaudited financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary, if any, for a fair statement of the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other future annual or interim period.  There have been no changes in the significant accounting policies from those included in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Reverse Stock Split 
    In June 2016, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation and grant of discretionary authority to the Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split. On October 11, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors effected a   10:1   reverse stock split of the Company's common stock. In addition, effective on the date of the reverse stock split, the conversion price of the Company's Preferred Stock was adjusted proportionately and consequently, each share of Preferred Stock became convertible into approximately   143   shares of common stock. The Company s historical share and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse split and corresponding change in conversion ratio. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.  
       
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This standard clarifies the treatment of specific cash flow issues in order to reduce existing diversity in practice.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, creating Topic 842, Leases, which supersedes the guidance in former ASC 840, Leases, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The standard will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   This standard amends existing guidance and requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. This standard is to be applied on a prospective basis and upon adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the accounting change. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 provides companies with two implementation methods. Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively  
  
   8

  (unaudited) 

with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application). This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  . This ASU defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by one year, requiring the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Additionally, this ASU permits earlier application only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  This standard clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This standard addresses certain issues identified in Topic 606 in the guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on its financial statements. 

3. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
  The Company s entire balance of   Cash and cash equivalents   as of   September 30, 2016   was held in demand accounts with   one   financial institution, which subjects the Company to significant concentration of credit risk. 

4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of held-to-maturity marketable securities by type of security was as follows (amounts in thousands): 

Marketable securities held by the Company consist of United States treasury bills, commercial paper, U.S. government-related debt, and corporate debt securities. All short-term marketable securities held by the Company mature within   one   year and all long-term marketable securities mature after   one   year but in less than   five   years from the respective balance sheet date.

  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cost of Atlas instruments, which represents equipment on lease or held for lease, was   $6.8 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively, net of accumulated depreciation of   $3.0 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  Expenses for depreciation of property and equipment were incurred as follows (amounts in thousands): 

7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  In June 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to its license agreement with Gen-Probe. Under the amendment, the Company obtained a   two  -year option to reduce the royalty rate it pays to Gen-Probe in exchange for an option payment of   $2.5 million  . Upon completion of its IPO in July 2014, the Company exercised its option and issued to Gen-Probe   86,506   shares of common stock valued at   $105.10   per share on the issuance date and made a cash payment of   $8.0 million  . The Company is required to make additional cash payments of   $5.0 million   on January 1, 2018 and   $5.0 million   on January 1, 2020. 
       
  The aggregate cash and stock payments made to Gen-Probe along with the present value of the two   $5.0 million   payments described above were recorded as a   $26.6 million   addition to the Company's intangible technology asset in   Intangible assets   on the Balance Sheet and will be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021, the end of the estimated remaining life of the technology asset. See Note 9 for further details on the additional required future cash payments described above. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement amendment, the Company committed to additional future contingent payments, as described in Note 11 below. If made, such additional payments will further reduce the royalty rate the Company pays to Gen-Probe, and will be recorded as additions to the Company's intangible technology asset upon payment and amortized over the estimated remaining life of the technology asset. 
    
  The Company assesses its intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows.   If the Company s estimated undiscounted future cash flows are below the asset group s carrying value, the Company may recognize an impairment charge measured by its fair value. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company prepared revised projections for revenue and expenses, which indicated continued cash flow losses for the Company, and as a result, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred. The  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents

Company completed an assessment of the asset group including the intangible asset for recoverability. The recoverability assessment was based upon probability-weighted cash flow estimates resulting from updated revenue and expense projections and an appropriate terminal value. Based on the impairment assessment, the Company determined that the asset group including the intangible asset was not impaired. 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's intangible asset as of the periods presented (amounts in thousands): 

8. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 
  The following table provides details of the Company s accrued expenses (amounts in thousands): 

Included in 'Other' is   $3.3 million   related to the pending litigation settlement discussed in Note 11. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, a settlement agreement between the Company and plaintiffs was reached, and the Company expects to recover the settlement amount in full from its insurance providers and accordingly has a corresponding receivable recorded in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet. 
   
  9. DEFERRED PAYMENTS 
  Gen-Probe supply agreement 
  In   May 2011  , the Company entered into a supply agreement with Gen-Probe to purchase Atlas instruments. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company can defer up to one half of the purchase price for up to   54 months   from the date of delivery. The deferred amounts do not bear interest, and the Company has recorded the imputed interest component as a reduction of the deferred payment and as a reduction of the asset cost. The supply agreement provides for variable repayment terms based on a percentage of net sales as defined in the agreement, and the Company has estimated its net sales in determining amounts due for the   54   month term. The following table summarizes the amounts deferred under this agreement (amounts in thousands): 

11 

     Table of Contents  
  ROKA BIOSCIENCE, INC. 
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

The Company estimated the interest rate implicit in the extended payment terms by considering the rate at which it could obtain financing of a similar nature from other sources at the date of each transaction, as well as prevailing rates for similar debt instruments of issuers with similar credit ratings. The estimated effective interest rate used ranges from   9.9%   to   11.2%  . 
  In the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, and in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively as non-cash interest expense related to the deferred payments pursuant to the supply agreement with Gen-Probe. 
  Gen-Probe license amendment 
  The amendment to the license agreement with Gen-Probe detailed in Note 7 includes a   $5.0 million   payment due on January 1, 2018 and a   $5.0 million   payment due on January 1, 2020. Under the terms of the amendment, no interest payments are required and no interest rate is stated. The Company determined that imputed interest must be calculated and recognized in accordance with ASC-835, and the payments are recorded in   Deferred payments   on the Balance Sheet at their present value based upon a   7.6%   interest rate for the payment due on January 1, 2018 and a   9.0%   interest rate for the payment due on January 1, 2020. The difference between the present value and the amount payable is accreted to   Deferred payments   over the respective term with a corresponding charge to   Interest expense  .  

10. NOTES PAYABLE 
    
  In November 2013, the Company entered into   two   loan and security agreements. One agreement was entered into with Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) and another agreement was entered into with TriplePoint Capital LLC ( TriplePoint ). Upon closing of the two agreements, the Company borrowed   $5.0 million   under the loan and security agreement with Comerica (the  Comerica Loan ). In March 2014, the Company borrowed   $5.0 million   under the loan and security agreement with TriplePoint (the  TriplePoint Loan ).  
  In May 2015, the Company paid off the remaining amounts outstanding and due under the TriplePoint Loan, which consisted of   $4.6 million   in principal and a   $0.4 million   final payment fee, and simultaneously amended the Comerica Loan (the  Comerica Amendment ). The Comerica Amendment increased the borrowing under the Comerica Loan to   $10.0 million   and extended the interest-only period until December 31, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Company will make monthly payments which will consist of accrued interest and equal principal payments in accordance with a   30  -month amortization schedule. The interest rate under the Comerica Amendment remains the same as under the original Comerica Loan, which accrues interest at Comerica s Prime Referenced Rate (as defined in the loan agreement with Comerica) plus   3.15%  , subject to a floor of the daily adjusting LIBOR rate plus   2.5%  . As of   September 30, 2016   the rate was   6.65%  .  
  In connection with the Comerica Loan and the Comerica Amendment, the Company recorded a liability for the note of   $9.8 million  , net of expenses paid to Comerica, the value of the warrants issued to Comerica and the incremental value due to the amendment of the original Comerica warrant at the time of the repricing. The difference between the liability recorded and the face value of the note will be accreted to   Notes payable   over the term of the loan with a corresponding charge to   Interest expense  .  
  Pursuant to the Comerica Amendment, the Company is required to maintain at least   $5.0 million   of unrestricted cash and/or marketable securities with Comerica at all times. As of   September 30, 2016   and during the period since the Company entered into the Comerica Amendment, the Company has been in compliance with this requirement. Additionally, the Comerica Loan contains various covenants that limit the Company s ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including limiting the Company s ability to; sell, transfer, lease or dispose of certain assets; engage in certain mergers and consolidations; incur debt or encumber or permit liens on certain assets, make certain restricted payments, including paying dividends on, or repurchasing or making distributions with respect to, the Company s common stock; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.  
  In connection with the closing of the loan and security agreements in November 2013, the Company issued warrants to Comerica and TriplePoint, see Note 15 for further details. In connection with the Comerica Amendment, the Company issued an additional warrant to Comerica to purchase up to an aggregate of   5,227   shares of common stock at   $28.70   per share and modified the exercise price of the original warrant granted to Comerica under the Comerica Loan from   $140.80   per share to   $28.70   per share. The value of the new warrant and the incremental value due to the amendment of the original Comerica warrant were recorded as a reduction to   Notes payable   with a corresponding offset to   Additional paid-in capital  .

In connection with the repayment of the TriplePoint Loan, the Company recorded approximately   $0.2 million    of   Interest expense   as the difference between the amount recorded in the Company's financial records and the amount paid. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the entire balance of   $6.9 million   has been classified as   Notes payable, current   on the Balance Sheet, although only   $4.0 million   is due within one year. The remaining   $2.9 million   has also been classified as   Notes payable, current   because the Comerica Loan agreement contains a material adverse change clause which allows Comerica to require repayment of the debt based on subjective factors regarding the Company s business and performance.  
   
  11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Operating Leases 
    
  The Company has not entered into any new operating leases or amended any existing operating leases during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Commitments 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant additions to the Company s commitments as disclosed in the Company s most recent audited financial statements. 

Contingent liabilities 
    
  In addition to the commitments disclosed in the Company s most recent audited financial statements, the amendment to the license agreement with Gen-Probe detailed in Note 9 provides for additional milestone payments of up to   $6.0 million   which will further reduce the royalty rate paid. Such payments are required to be made upon meeting certain revenue milestones or may be made at the election of the Company prior to meeting the revenue milestones. 
  Legal Matters 
  The Company may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with its business. Except as set forth below, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings, nor are any claims pending against the Company.  
       
  A putative securities class action originally captioned   Ding v. Roka Bioscience, Inc.  , Case No. 3:14-cv-8020, was filed against the Company and certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on December 24, 2014, on behalf of a putative class of persons and entities who had purchased or otherwise acquired securities pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement for the Company s IPO. The original putative class period ran from July 17 through November 6, 2014. The original complaint asserted claims under the Securities Act of 1933 and contended that the IPO Registration Statement was false and misleading, or omitted allegedly material information, in connection with the Company s statements about its placement of Atlas instruments and its expectations of future growth and increased market share, and the Company s alleged failure to disclose  known trends and uncertainties about the Company s sales.   The alleged misrepresentations and omissions purportedly came to light when the Company issued its third-quarter 2014 earnings release on November 6, 2014. 
       
  Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the court appointed Stanley Yedlowski as lead plaintiff and The Rosen Law Firm as lead counsel on April 21, 2015. The lead plaintiff then filed an amended complaint, captioned   Stanley Yedlowski v. Roka Bioscience, Inc.  , Case No. 14-cv-8020, on June 23, 2015. The amended complaint pleads Securities Act claims on behalf of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Roka securities pursuant or traceable to the IPO Registration Statement during an extended putative class period, running from July 17, 2014 through March 26, 2015. The amended complaint alleges that the Registration Statement was false or misleading in that it failed to disclose that the Company s customers purportedly were experiencing false positives and other usage issues with the Company s Listeria assay apparently arising from the customers  employees  inability to follow the Company s Listeria assay workflow. The amended complaint alleges that the full extent of the purported misstatements and omissions was not revealed until March 26, 2015. Defendants filed a motion on August 25, 2015 to dismiss the amended complaint, and plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion on October 9, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company and plaintiffs reached a settlement agreement, subject to court approval, for an amount of approximately   $3.3 million  . Accordingly, the Company recorded a liability in   Accrued expenses   on its Balance Sheet. Additionally,  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  
  ROKA BIOSCIENCE, INC. 
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

the Company recorded a corresponding receivable in   Prepaid expenses and other current assets   on its Balance Sheet for the expected reimbursement under its insurance policies. 
  The court granted preliminary approval of the parties' proposed settlement on June 28, 2016, and scheduled a fairness hearing for November 9, 2016. At that hearing, the court will consider whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement. The Company has various insurance policies related to the risks associated with its business, including directors  and officers  liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that the Company would be successful in its defense of the securities class action if the proposed settlement is not approved (including through any appeals), and there is no assurance that the insurance coverage would be sufficient or that the insurance carriers would cover all claims or litigation costs.   
  The Company sells its products in various jurisdictions and is subject to federal, state and local taxes including, where applicable, sales and use tax. While the Company believes that it has properly paid or accrued for all such taxes based on its interpretation of applicable law, tax laws are complex and interpretations differ. Periodically, the Company may be audited by taxing authorities, and it is possible that additional assessments may be made in the future. 

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company s financial instruments consist of   cash and cash equivalents,   marketable securities  , trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term deferred payments, deferred payments, notes payable, accrued expenses   and Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants. The carrying amounts of   cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term deferred payments and accrued expenses   approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of the instruments, or, in the case of the   deferred payments   and   notes payable  , because the interest rates the Company believes it could obtain for similar borrowings is similar to its existing interest rates.  The carrying amount of the Company's marketable securities is the amortized cost basis based upon their held-to-maturity classification.  
  The following table summarizes the fair value information for the Company s cash held in money market deposit accounts and its marketable securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands): 

A portion of the Company s   cash and cash equivalents   are held in money market deposit accounts and a portion of the Company's   short-term marketable securities   are United States treasury bills, each of which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices.  
  The Company's   short-term marketable securities   and   long-term marketable securities   not classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are comprised of commercial paper, U.S. government-related debt, and corporate debt securities, all of which are classified as  Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimates the fair values of these marketable securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from its investment manager, which utilizes industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. There have been no transfers between levels during the reporting period.

13. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
    
  Authorized stock 
    
  In connection with the seventh amended and restated certificate of incorporation effective on July 22, 2014, the total authorized shares of stock was changed to   520,000,000   of which   500,000,000   shares are designated as common stock with a par value of   $0.001   per share and   20,000,000   shares are designated as preferred stock with a par value of   $0.001   per share.   In connection with the offering described under "Convertible Preferred Stock" below, on September 21, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Certificate of Designation ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to designate   22,500   shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 
    
  Convertible Preferred Stock 
    
  On September 21, 2016, the Company closed a private placement offering (the "Offering") in which it issued and sold   22,500   shares of Series A Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") and   five  -year warrants (the "Investor Warrants") to purchase an aggregate of approximately   3,214,299   shares of the Company s common stock, par value   $0.001   (the  Warrant Shares ) at a purchase price of   $1,000   per share of Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds of   $22.5 million  . The shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at a conversion rate of   $7.00   per share of common stock and are immediately convertible at the option of the holder up to the holder's pro rata share of   19.999%   of the Company's common stock outstanding on the closing date of the transaction. All shares of Preferred Stock will automatically convert to common stock upon shareholder approval which is expected to be obtained at a special shareholder meeting scheduled for November 10, 2016. The Company allocated the proceeds of the Offering on the relative fair values of the Preferred Stock and the Investor Warrants. As a result of the allocation of the proceeds, the shares of Preferred Stock were determined to contain a beneficial conversion feature valued at   $7.7 million  . For the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of   $1.9 million   related to the beneficial conversion feature of the Preferred Stock and will recognize the remaining portion of the beneficial conversion feature as a deemed dividend through the conversion date in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Registration rights 
  Holders of approximately   0.8 million   shares of the Company's outstanding common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of such shares of common stock, as well as piggyback registration rights. These rights are provided under the terms of an investor rights agreement between the Company and the holders of the registerable securities, which will expire upon the earlier of (i)   five years   after the Company's IPO and (ii) as to a holder, at such time as all registrable securities held by such holder may be sold without restriction under Rule 144. 
    
  In connection with the Offering, on September 21, 2016, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement which provides that the Company will prepare and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), a resale shelf registration statement covering the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares. Accordingly, on October 7, 2016, the Company filed an S-3 registration statement which was declared effective on October 24, 2016 enabling registration of the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares. The Company is required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the earlier of:  (i) the date that all registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold, thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144 or (ii) the date that all registrable securities covered by such registration statement may be sold without limitation pursuant to Rule 144 (the  Effectiveness Period ).  Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the registration rights agreement, if the Company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement during the Effectiveness Period, the Company will be required to pay to each holder an amount in cash equal to the product of   1.5%   multiplied by the aggregate purchase price paid by such holder pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, subject to a cap of equal to   10.0%   of the aggregate purchase paid by such holder pursuant to the securities purchase agreement.

14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Effective upon the closing of the IPO, the Company adopted the Roka Bioscience, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"). The 2014 Plan initially made available   108,695   shares to be granted to employees, officers, directors, consultants, advisors or other individual service providers of the Company. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Plan shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year for a period of   ten   years commencing on January 1, 2015 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2024, in an amount equal to   3%   of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year. 
  Under the Roka Bioscience, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ), as amended on June 13, 2013, incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock may be granted for up to a maximum of   202,885   shares to employees, consultants and directors of the Company. Effective upon adoption of the 2014 Plan, the Company does not intend to issue additional shares under the 2009 Plan.  
  Stock options and shares of restricted stock granted under the 2009 Plan and the 2014 Plan have a maximum contractual term of   ten years   from the date of grant and generally vest over   four years  . For stock options, the exercise price may not be less than the fair value of the stock on the grant date. 
    
    The Company recognized stock compensation expense as follows (amounts in thousands): 

The Company granted approximately   100,100   stock options and   2,500   shares of restricted stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , valued at approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.01 million  , respectively. The Company granted approximately   94,000   stock options and   37,500   shares of restricted stock valued at approximately   $2.7 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The Company determines the fair value of stock option awards at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. This model requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments on the expected volatility, dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the stock options. The following ranges of assumptions were utilized for stock options granted during the periods indicated: 

The Company estimates the expected life of its employee stock options using the  simplified  method, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. The expected stock price volatility rates are based on average historical volatilities of the common stock of the Company and a group of public companies in similar industries. The Company has no history or expectations of paying dividends on its common stock and therefore uses a   zero   percent dividend yield in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

  (unaudited) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   3,460,830   warrant shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of   $7.18   per share.  
  Warrants Issued Prior to IPO       
  Immediately prior to the Company's IPO, the Company had Series B Warrants outstanding which allowed their holders to purchase   2,480,000   shares of Series B at an exercise price of   $1.00   per share. In connection with the IPO, the warrants converted into warrants to purchase common stock at their conversion rate of approximately   0.0906   common warrant shares to one Series B warrant share. Such warrants expired in   September 2016  , and based upon the Company's stock price at the time, no shares were issued. 
  In connection with the closing of the loan and security agreements in November 2013 discussed in Note 10, the Company issued warrants to Comerica and TriplePoint to purchase up to an aggregate of   352,941   shares of Series E with an exercise price of   $1.28  . Upon issuance, the Company recorded liabilities of approximately   $0.03 million   and   $0.06 million   for the warrants issued to Comerica and TriplePoint, respectively. The initial fair value of the warrant issued to Comerica of approximately   $0.03 million   was deemed a discount on the debt issued by Comerica and is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the Comerica Loan. The initial fair value of the warrants issued to TriplePoint of approximately   $0.06 million   were capitalized in   Other assets   on the Balance Sheet as part of debt issuance costs and were amortized to   Interest expense.   In connection with the borrowings made under the TriplePoint Loan in March 2014, one of the TriplePoint warrants became exercisable for an additional   156,863   shares of Series E. The related fair value of approximately   $0.1 million   was deemed a discount on the debt issued by TriplePoint and was accreted to interest expense over the term of the TriplePoint Loan through the early payoff in May 2015, at which time the remaining discount was charged to interest expense. In connection with the IPO, the Series E warrants converted into warrants to purchase common stock at their conversion rate of approximately   0.0906   common warrant shares to one Series E warrant share.  As a result, and subsequent to the reverse stock split conducted in October 2016, such warrants became exercisable for   4,618   shares of common stock with an exercise price of   $140.80  .  
  Warrants Issued Subsequent to IPO 
  In connection with the Comerica Amendment on May 29, 2015, the Company issued an additional warrant to Comerica to purchase up to an aggregate of   5,227   shares of common stock at   $28.70   per share and modified the exercise price of the original warrant granted to Comerica to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,066   shares of common stock from   $140.80   per share to   $28.70   per share. 
  In connection with the Offering discussed in Note 13, the Company issued Investor Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately   3,214,299   shares of the Company s common stock and warrants to the placement agent to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately   236,684   shares of the Company's common stock (the "Placement Warrants"). The Investor Warrants and Placement Warrants have an exercise price of   $7.00   and expire   five years   from the date of issuance. 

16. NET LOSS PER SHARE 
  Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. The weighted-average common shares outstanding excludes unvested restricted stock which although such shares are legally issued and outstanding, are not required to share in losses of the Company and are therefore excluded from the net loss per share calculation. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period, determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share applicable to common stockholders were the same for all periods presented.

As the Company incurred a loss for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , all unvested restricted stock awards were excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share and all potential common stock shares issuable for stock options and warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive. Had the Company not incurred a loss, the dilutive effect of the unvested restricted stock awards on basic weighted average common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of potential common stock shares issuable for Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants on the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding would have been as follows: 

17. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company operates in a single reportable segment. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   customers which each generated more than   10%   of the Company s revenues and during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company had   four   customers which each generated more than   10%   of the Company s revenues.

  Overview 
  Background 
  We are a molecular diagnostics company initially focused on providing advanced testing solutions for the detection of foodborne pathogens. The proprietary molecular technology used in our assays enables us to offer accurate and rapid testing solutions while our fully automated Atlas instrument helps our customers reduce labor costs and minimize operator error. In late 2012, we launched our proprietary Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument in the North American food safety testing market and we have worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our advanced molecular testing solutions for a wide range of other industrial applications. 
  Our company was founded in 2009 through the acquisition of the industrial application market assets of Gen-Probe. The acquisition included a worldwide license for Gen-Probe s molecular assay technologies in the industrial application markets, access to certain instrument platforms as well as certain key development personnel. Our advanced molecular assays and automated instruments are derived from Gen-Probe technologies, which Gen-Probe uses in the highly regulated clinical diagnostics and blood screening markets. 
  We are focused on the commercialization of a comprehensive menu of molecular diagnostic products for the detection of foodborne pathogens under the Atlas brand name. We believe that other available pathogen test methods have significant performance gaps with respect to accuracy, time to results and automation, which are areas of critical importance to food processors, third-party contract testing laboratories and the government agencies that regulate food safety. Our Atlas solution is designed to provide our customers with accurate and rapid test results with reduced labor costs and improved laboratory efficiencies. In addition, we are developing a molecular chemistry and instrument platform in the near term, which is expected to address the needs of lower-volume throughput food safety customers and to have potential clinical applications.  
  Our commercial success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument. Our sales cycle is lengthy, often lasting longer than 12 months, which makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and other operating results. Through   September 30, 2016  , we have installed   49   Atlas instruments pursuant to commercial agreements, and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   $1.9 million   and   $5.3 million   in revenue respectively, which was derived from a small number of customers. Since our inception in 2009, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our advanced molecular testing solutions. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and as of   September 30, 2016  , our accumulated deficit was   $194.8 million  . We expect to continue to incur operating losses over the near term as we pursue our commercial strategy, operate as a public company and continue development of products and technology. In order to achieve and sustain profitability, we will need to significantly increase our revenue and the number of customers that are using our products.

  Our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our Atlas Detection Assays and consumable supplies for our Atlas instruments. Our Atlas Detection Assays and our consumable supplies are designed to be used only on our Atlas instruments and our Atlas instruments will only accept our Atlas Detection Assays and our consumable supplies. This closed system model enables us to generate recurring revenue from the sale of our Atlas Detection Assays and other consumable supplies for use with each Atlas instrument we place. We mostly place our Atlas instruments with customers through reagent rental agreements, and recover the cost of providing the Atlas instruments, including services related to instrument maintenance, repairs, installation and training to our customers, in the amount charged for our Atlas Detection Assays. The reagent rental agreements are typically for a one-year initial period with automatic renewal provisions, and have no minimum purchase obligations. 
  Shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in our billings to customers. Revenue is generally recognized when our Atlas Detection Assays and other consumable supplies are shipped to the customer. 
  In addition to the sale of our Atlas Detection Assays, we generate limited revenue from instrument rental and service and maintenance contracts. Revenue from instrument rental and service and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. We also offer our Atlas instruments for sale, and during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold one Atlas instrument.

Potential customers for our products typically need to commit significant time and resources to evaluate our products, due to the nature and cost of our products and their impact on the potential customers  businesses. To date, it has been difficult for us to accurately project revenues and other operating results due to these and other factors. In addition, the revenue generated from sales of our Atlas Detection Assays may fluctuate from time to time due to changes in the testing volumes of our customers. As a result, our financial results may fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis 
  Our future revenue growth is dependent on our ability to place additional commercial instruments with customers and increased usage of our Atlas Detection Assays. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   we increased the number of instruments placed with customers by three and eight, respectively. We do not expect our revenue to increase significantly in the near term until we place additional instruments and drive adoption of our assays. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Cost of revenue 
  Cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs associated with the production and distribution of our Atlas Detection Assays and consumable supplies for our Atlas instruments. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation on Atlas instruments installed with our customers under reagent rental or rental agreements, expenses related to service and maintenance of instruments, and royalties payable under a technology license agreement with Gen-Probe.  
    
  We manufacture our Atlas Detection Assays and consumable supplies in our San Diego facility, which has significant capacity for expansion. To date, the underutilized capacity in this facility has contributed to a high cost of revenue relative to revenue. 
  We expect our cost of revenue to increase as we place additional Atlas instruments and manufacture and sell an increasing number of our Atlas Detection Assays and consumable supplies. We estimate cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will decrease in future periods to the extent our manufacturing and sales volumes of Atlas Detection Assays increase. 
  Research and development 
  Our research and development expenses are primarily associated with costs incurred for development, improvements and support activities for our Atlas instruments and Atlas Detection Assays. These expenses consist principally of payroll, employee benefits, as well as fees for contract research, consulting services and laboratory supplies. We expense all research and development costs as incurred. 
  In addition, we are currently developing a molecular chemistry and instrument platform, which is expected to address the needs of lower-volume throughput food safety customers and to have potential clinical applications.  We expect our research and development expenses to remain approximately at their current level for the remainder of   2016  .  
  Selling, general and administrative 
  Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our sales organization as well as our executive, accounting, information technology and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of payroll, employee benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation, as well as professional services fees such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, and general corporate costs. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred. 
  We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to remain at approximately the current level during the remainder of   2016  . 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  In connection with the acquisition of the industrial application market assets of Gen-Probe, we acquired certain in-process research and development projects that were recorded as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. Upon completion of the development of our first Atlas Detection Assay in January 2012, this asset was transferred from in-process research and development to a definite life intangible asset and we initiated amortization of the asset over its estimated useful life of 10 years. In June 2014, we entered into an amendment to our license agreement with Gen-Probe. Under the amendment, we obtained a two-year option to reduce the royalty rate we pay to Gen-Probe in exchange for an option payment of   $2.5 million  . Upon completion of our IPO we exercised our option and issued to Gen-Probe   86,506   shares of common stock and made a cash payment of   $8.0 million  . We are required to make additional cash payments of   $5.0 million    on January 1, 2018 and   $5.0 million   on January 1, 2020. The aggregate cash and stock payments made to Gen-Probe along with the present value of the two   $5.0 million   payments described above were recorded as a   $26.6 million   addition to our intangible technology asset in   Intangible assets   on the Balance Sheet in the third quarter of 2014. This addition is being amortized through December 31, 2021, the end of the estimated remaining life of

     Table of Contents  

the technology asset. In addition to the payments outlined above, the amendment to the license agreement provides for additional milestone payments of up to $6.0 million to further reduce the royalty rate paid. As a result, we anticipate amortization expenses for these intangible assets to increase in future periods if these additional milestone payments are made. We assess our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows.   For example, if our commercialization efforts are not successful, or if commercialization progress takes longer than anticipated, we may recognize a non-cash impairment charge with respect to the asset group including our intangible asset and other long-lived assets in future periods.  
  Other Income (Expenses) 
  Interest Income (Expense), net 
  Interest income is derived from cash and cash equivalents held with our banking institution as well as our short-term and long-term marketable securities. Interest income fluctuates based on the current interest rate available from our banking institution and the amount of funds held in cash accounts and marketable securities. Interest expense during the periods presented is associated with the $10.0 million of debt initially outstanding under the two loan and security agreements we entered into in November 2013, the repayment of the TriplePoint loan and the amendment to the Comerica loan in the three months ended June 30, 2015, the two individual $5.0 million payments due to Gen-Probe on January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020, respectively, under the terms of the royalty reduction option exercised under the terms of the amendment to our license agreement, as well as the extended payment terms provided to us by Gen-Probe on the purchase of Atlas instruments. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for further details. 
  We expect our interest expense to remain at approximately the current level for the remainder of   2016  .

  Comparison of the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenue 
  Revenue   increased   by   $0.4 million   to   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   225,000   Atlas Detection Assays compared to   183,000   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   49   instruments placed with customers under commercial agreements, compared to   39   instruments as of   September 30, 2015  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the average revenue per instrument placed under commercial agreements was approximately $40,000, compared to $39,000 for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , two customers each accounted for more than 10% of revenues and generated approximately $0.9 million of revenue compared to four customers who generated $1.1 million of revenue in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  Cost of Revenue 
  Cost of revenue   increased   by   $0.3 million  , to   $2.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to direct costs related to increased sales volume of approximately $0.4 million, partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in instrument service costs. 
  Research and Development 
  Research and development expense   decreased   by   $0.5 million   to   $1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $2.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in use of supplies and a $0.2 million decrease in payroll related expenses as a result of reduced headcount. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   decreased   by   $0.4 million  , to   $4.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $4.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in outside services primarily due to a decrease in legal fees of $0.4 million partially offset by an increase in consulting fees of $0.1 million and a decrease of $0.2 million in payroll related expenses as a result of reduced headcount. 
  Amortization of intangible assets 
  Amortization of intangibles was unchanged for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Other (Expense) Income 
  Interest Income (Expense), net 
  Net interest expense remained approximately the same at   $0.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and the   three months ended September 30, 2015 

Comparison of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    

Revenue 
  Revenue   increased   by   $0.8 million  , to   $5.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $4.5 million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of increased demand for our Atlas Detection Assays and the sale of one Atlas instrument. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   637,000   Atlas Detection Assays compared to   512,000   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   49   instruments placed with customers under commercial agreements, compared to   39   instruments as of   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the average revenue per instrument placed under commercial agreements was approximately   $117,000  , compared to   $115,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to somewhat higher utilization of the instruments placed under commercial agreements. Our two largest customers, which each accounted for more than 10% of revenues, collectively generated approximately $2.7 million of revenue in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to four customers which each accounted for more than 10% of revenues who collectively generated approximately $3.0 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  Cost of Revenue 
  Cost of revenue   increased   by approximately   $0.7 million   to   $6.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $5.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to the impact from inventory provisions in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   being higher than the inventory provisions in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   by approximately $0.3 million, as well as direct costs related to higher sales volumes of approximately $0.3 million along with increased expenses related to sales, installation and service of Atlas instruments of approximately $0.2 million. 
  Research and Development 
  Research and development expense   decreased   by approximately   $0.7 million  , to   $5.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $5.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in payroll related expenses as a result of reduced headcount, a $0.4 million decrease in supplies used and a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million in external development services.

Selling, General and Administrative 
  Selling, general and administrative expense   decreased   by approximately   $2.1 million  , to   $13.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $15.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Payroll related expenses decreased by approximately $1.3 million, primarily driven by a decrease in headcount affected in the fourth quarter of 2015, and consulting services decreased by approximately $0.7 million.

  Amortization of intangibles were unchanged for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other (Expense) Income 
  Interest Income (Expense), net 
  Net interest expense   decreased   by   $0.4 million   to   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from net interest expense of   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to   $0.2 million   recognized upon the early repayment of the TriplePoint loan in May 2015 and a higher outstanding debt balance during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Prior to our IPO in July 2014, our operations were primarily financed through private sales of shares of our preferred stock and debt. Upon closing of our IPO on July 22, 2014 we received approximately $53.2 million of net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses. In October 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for sale any combination of the types of securities described in the filing up to an amount of $100 million. The shelf registration went effective on October 7, 2015. No securities have been sold by us under this shelf registration. In September 2016, we closed a private placement stock offering in which we sold 22,500 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately   3,214,299   shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock  and we received approximately   $21.3 million   in proceeds from the offering after deducting commissions and offering expenses.  
    
  We have incurred negative cash flows from operating and investment activities since our inception in 2009, and we expect to continue to incur negative cash flows from operating activities until we achieve a significant increase in our revenue. Since inception, we have devoted our resources to funding research and development and to commercializing the assets and technology acquired from Gen-Probe, as well as development of a small volume instrument. At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $9.0 million   and marketable securities of   $21.9 million   and an accumulated deficit of   $194.8 million  .  
  The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (amounts in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Operating Activities 
  Net cash   used in   operating activities was   $18.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and resulted from a   $23.3 million   net loss and   $2.6 million   net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by   $7.1 million   in non-cash items, principally depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, provisions for inventory and non-cash interest expense. 
  Net cash   used in   operating activities was   $18.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and resulted from   $26.6 million   net loss, partially offset by   $7.7 million   in non-cash items, principally depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense, and   $0.6 million   net changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash   provided by   investing activities was   $6.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and was primarily the result of maturities of marketable securities that were not reinvested. Net cash   provided by   investing activities was   $18.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and was primarily the result of maturities of marketable securities that were not reinvested.  
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $17.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and warrants in September 2016, partially offset by repayment of amounts outstanding under our loan and security agreement with Comerica of   $3.0 million  , and deferred payments made to Gen-Probe under our supply agreement of   $0.7 million  .  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.3 million   and consisted primarily of the repayment of amounts outstanding under our loan and security agreement with TriplePoint Capital of $5.4 million, partially offset by proceeds under the amendment of our loan and security agreement with Comerica of $5.0 million. 
  Operating Capital Requirements 
  We have limited capital resources and have experienced negative cash flows from operations and have incurred net losses since inception. We expect to continue to experience negative cash flows from operations and incur net losses in the near term as we devote substantially all of our efforts on commercialization of our products and continued product development. We expect future operating, investment and financing activities to be funded by our product revenue, our existing cash and cash equivalents, and from cash raised through debt or equity offerings, if any, in the future. Based on our current business plan, we currently anticipate that we will have sufficient capital to fund our existing operations through 2017. Our liquidity requirements may be negatively impacted by changes to our business plan, a lengthier sales cycle, lower demand for our products or other risks described elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and therefore we may need to raise capital sooner than currently anticipated. Our liquidity requirements have and will continue to consist of research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate expenses. Our future liquidity requirements will also include interest and principal payments on our debt and future payments to Gen-Probe of $5.0 million on January 1, 2018 and $5.0 million on January 1, 2020 as well as general and administrative expenses, such as insurance costs and professional fees associated with being a public company. As demand for our products increases, we expect that our capital requirements will also increase in order to purchase additional Atlas instruments for placement with customers and fund working capital requirements such as inventory and accounts receivable. 
  Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth and ability to generate cash flows from operating activities; the level of our sales and marketing and research and development activities; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the cost of and potential delays in product development; any change in regulatory oversight applicable to our products; and potential costs related to international expansion. 
  We may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations and commercialize our products. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. We may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing. In addition, we may raise additional capital, to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights.

These statements regarding our future liquidity requirements are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in the section  Risk Factors  of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates regarding our future liquidity requirements on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
  Term Loan and Security Agreements 
  In November 2013, we entered into loan and security agreements with each of Comerica Bank, or Comerica, and with TriplePoint Capital LLC, or TriplePoint. 
  Under the terms of our loan agreement with Comerica, we borrowed $5.0 million in November 2013. The Comerica loan bears interest at Comerica s Prime Referenced Rate (as defined in the loan agreement with Comerica) plus 3.15 %, subject to a floor of the daily adjusting LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, which was   6.65%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Pursuant to the terms of our loan agreement with TriplePoint, we borrowed $5.0 million in March 2014. The borrowings under the TriplePoint loan accrued interest at the Prime Rate plus 6.25%, but not less than 9.5% and were repayable over 36 months from the borrowing date with an interest-only period of 12 months, and equal monthly installments of principal and interest over the remaining term of the loan after the interest only period. 
  In May 2015, we paid off the remaining amounts due under the TriplePoint Loan, which consisted of   $4.6 million   in principal and a   $350,000   final payment fee and simultaneously amended the Comerica Loan (the  Comerica Amendment ). The Comerica Amendment increased the borrowing under the Comerica Loan to   $10.0 million  , extended the interest-only period from June 1, 2015 until December 31, 2015 and extended the overall term by 12 months. In January, we began making monthly payments which consist of accrued interest and equal principal payments in accordance with a   30  -month amortization schedule.  
  Pursuant to the Comerica Amendment we are required to maintain at least   $5.0 million   of unrestricted cash and/or marketable securities with Comerica at all times. As of   September 30, 2016   and during the period since we entered into the Comerica Amendment, we have been in compliance with this requirement. Additionally, the Comerica Loan contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including limiting our ability to; sell, transfer, lease or dispose of certain assets; engage in certain mergers and consolidations; incur debt or encumber or permit liens on certain assets, make certain restricted payments, including paying dividends on, or repurchasing or making distributions with respect to, our common stock; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $7.0 million outstanding under the amended Comerica Loan. We may prepay the loan to Comerica, in full or in part at any time, provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing. 
  In connection with entering into the loan and security agreements in November 2013, we issued to Comerica a ten-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 117,647 shares of our Series E preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.28 per share, and we issued to TriplePoint ten-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 235,294 shares of our Series E preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.28 per share. In connection with the borrowings in March 2014, the TriplePoint warrants became exercisable for an additional 156,863 shares of our Series E preferred stock. The warrants issued to TriplePoint contain net issuance exercise provisions. The Comerica and TriplePoint warrants contain anti-dilution adjustment provisions for stock splits, dividends, combinations, reclassifications or exchanges and as such in connection with the IPO, these warrants converted into warrants to purchase common stock at their conversion rate of approximately 0.0906 common warrant shares to one Series E warrant share. As a result, and subsequent to the reverse stock split conducted in October 2016, such warrants became exercisable for   4,618   shares of common stock with an exercise price of   $140.80  .  
  In connection with the Comerica Amendment in May 2015, we issued an additional warrant to Comerica to purchase up to an aggregate of   5,227   shares of common stock at   $28.70   per share and modified the exercise price of the original warrant granted to Comerica to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,066   shares of common stock from   $140.80   per share to   $28.70   per share.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   3,460,830   warrant shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of   $7.18   per share. The Comerica and TriplePoint warrants have the same  piggyback  registration rights as holders of registrable securities under the investors' rights agreement. Such rights will expire upon the earlier of (i) five years after our IPO and (ii) as to any holder, at such time as all registrable securities held by such holder may be sold without restriction under Rule 144.  
    
  Controlled Equity Offering   SM    Sales Agreement

     Table of Contents  

We entered into a Controlled Equity Offering   SM    Sales Agreement, dated October 30, 2015, with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor Fitzgerald shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to $6,750,000.  We are not obligated to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal law, rules and regulations and the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market to sell shares from time to time based upon our instructions, including any price, time or size limits specified by us. We will pay Cantor Fitzgerald a commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares and to reimburse Cantor Fitzgerald for certain specified expenses.  As of   November 1, 2016  , we had not sold any shares under this Sales Agreement.  

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no significant additions to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our audited financial statements as of   December 31, 2015  . The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    The deferred payment obligations are based upon the gross deferred amounts outstanding for instruments purchased from Gen-Probe as of   September 30, 2016   as disclosed in the notes to our unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  Such amounts are recorded at their aggregate present value of $3.4 million on the Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . The timing of when these payments are due reflects our current estimates of repayment. We do not believe that future revisions of estimates will have a significant impact on the timing of payments. Additionally, amounts due beyond one year represent the two separate $5.0 million lump-sum payments payable to Gen-Probe in accordance with the amendment to our licensing agreement discussed in "Results of Operations". Such amounts are recorded at their aggregate present value of $8.3 million on the Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Our operating lease obligations represent the contractual payments due for the lease of our corporate office in Warren, NJ, our laboratory in Warren, NJ and our facility in San Diego, CA. 
              (3) 
    Our purchase obligations represent the total cost of instruments and supplies which we are committed to purchase from Gen-Probe as well as additional obligations due under other agreements entered into in the normal course of business. In accordance with the supply agreement with Gen-Probe, our purchases of Atlas instruments are defined in rolling quarterly forecasts, and these forecasts become binding commitments for approximately nine months of Atlas instrument purchases at any given time. Our obligation to purchase supplies from Gen-Probe is defined in an annual purchase order submitted in the third quarter of each year. 
              (4) 
    Such amounts include total principal repayments of   $7.0 million   and final payment fees of   $0.04 million  , of which approximately   $4.0 million   is due within one year from the Balance Sheet date. The remaining amounts are shown as being due in less than one year as our loan agreement contains a material adverse change clause which allows the lender to call the debt based on subjective factors regarding our business and performance. Amounts which are or may become payable as interest are excluded from the table, but are estimated to approximate   $0.1 million   during the remainder of   2016  .  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
  We have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents of   $9.0 million   were primarily held in money market deposit accounts. Our primary exposure to market risk for our cash and cash equivalents is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in the interest rates associated with these instruments is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $21.9 million   of marketable securities classified as held-to-maturity on our balance sheet which had a fair value of   $21.9 million  . As our intention is to hold these investments through maturity, any interest rate fluctuation changing the fair value of such marketable securities would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $7.0 million   of variable interest-rate debt outstanding under the Amendment to the loan and security agreement with Comerica. Considering the amounts outstanding and the term of the loan and security agreement, we do not believe a 1.0% increase in the interest rate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  We do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

a)   Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
  We continue the process of reviewing and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
  Our management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  b)   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with our business. Except as set forth below, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings, nor are any claims pending against us.  

30 

A putative securities class action originally captioned   Ding v. Roka Bioscience, Inc.  , Case No. 3:14-cv-8020, was filed against Roka and certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on December 24, 2014, on behalf of a putative class of persons and entities who had purchased or otherwise acquired Roka securities pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement for the Company s initial public offering (the  IPO ). The original putative class period ran from July 17 through November 6, 2014. The original complaint asserted claims under the Securities Act of 1933 and contended that the IPO Registration Statement was false and misleading, or omitted allegedly material information, in connection with the Company s statements about its placement of Atlas instruments and its expectations of future growth and increased market share, and the Company s alleged failure to disclose  known trends and uncertainties about the Company s sales.   The alleged misrepresentations and omissions purportedly came to light when Roka issued its third-quarter 2014 earnings release on November 6, 2014. 
       
  Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the court appointed Stanley Yedlowski as lead plaintiff and The Rosen Law Firm as lead counsel on April 21, 2015. The lead plaintiff then filed an amended complaint, captioned   Stanley Yedlowski v. Roka Bioscience, Inc.  , Case No. 14-cv-8020, on June 23, 2015. The amended complaint pleads Securities Act claims on behalf of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Roka securities pursuant or traceable to the IPO Registration Statement during an extended putative class period, running from July 17, 2014 through March 26, 2015. The amended complaint alleges that the Registration Statement was false or misleading in that it failed to disclose that our customers purportedly were experiencing false positives and other usage issues with our Listeria assay apparently arising from the customers  employees  inability to follow tour Listeria assay workflow. The amended complaint alleges that the full extent of the purported misstatements and omissions was not revealed until March 26, 2015. Defendants filed a motion on August 25, 2015 to dismiss the amended complaint, and plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion on October 9, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we and the plaintiffs reached a settlement agreement, subject to court approval, for an amount of approximately $3.3 million. Accordingly, we recorded a liability on our Balance Sheet. Additionally, we recorded a corresponding receivable on our Balance Sheet for the expected reimbursement under our insurance policies. 
  The court granted preliminary approval of the parties' proposed settlement on June 28, 2016, and scheduled a fairness hearing for November 9, 2016. At that hearing, the court will consider whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement.  We have various insurance policies related to the risk associated with our business, including directors  and officers  liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that we would be successful in our defense of the securities class action if the proposed settlement is not approved (including through any appeals), and there is no assurance that our insurance coverage would be sufficient or that our insurance carriers would cover all claims or litigation costs.  
   
  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
    
  Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016. 

The sale of a substantial amount of our common stock, including resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and the exercise of the warrants acquired in the Offering, in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience significant dilution. 
    
  Pursuant to the registration rights granted in the Offering, we filed a registration statement covering the resale of up to an aggregate of 6,283,168 shares of common stock, including 3,141,584 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and 3,141,584 shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants.  We have outstanding an aggregate of   1,841,121   shares of our common stock as of   November 1, 2016  . Upon receipt of stockholder approval at the special meeting of stockholders scheduled for November 10, 2016, the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into approximately 3,214,299 shares of common stock.   As a result, our stockholders will experience significant dilution. 
    
  Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market value of our other securities, and and we cannot predict if and when the purchasers may sell such shares in the public markets.  The exercise of the warrants could result  
  
   31 

in substantial dilution to shareholders.  In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a future financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities 
  Not applicable. 
  Use of Proceeds 
  On July 16, 2014, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-196135) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission for our initial public offering. On July 22, 2014, we completed our initial public offering, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $53.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $2.6 million. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have used $44.9 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering, of which $8.0 million was paid to Gen-Probe pursuant to the terms of the second amendment to our license agreement with Gen-Probe and the remaining $29.5 million was used in operating activities including the commercialization of our Atlas Detection Assays and ongoing research and development activities. We have invested the balance of the net proceeds from the offering in cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 17, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424(b). 
  Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
  In connection with the vesting of restricted stock certain of our employees may elect to have shares withheld and transferred back to us in order to cover their income taxes payable as allowed under our equity compensation plans.  
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , no shares were withheld and transferred back to us to cover tax liabilities.
