  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Franklin Wireless Corp. ( the Company ) have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and are presented
in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, the financial statements included herein contain
all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, the results
of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented.  These financial
statements and notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016 included in the Company s Form 10-K filed on September 28, 2016. The operating results or cash flows
for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period
or the full year. 

NOTE 2 - BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

We are a provider of intelligent
wireless solutions including mobile hotspots, routers and modems as well as innovative hardware and software products that support
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our M2M and IoT solutions include embedded modules, modems
and gateways built to deliver reliable always-on connectivity supporting a broad spectrum of applications. These products are designed
to solve wireless connectivity challenges in a variety of vertical markets including video surveillance, digital signage, home
security, oil and gas exploration, kiosks, fleet management, smart grid, vehicle diagnostics, telematics and many more. 

We have a majority ownership
position in Franklin Technology Inc. ( FTI ), a research and development company located in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily
provides design and development services to us for our wireless products. 

Our products are generally
marketed and sold directly to wireless operators, and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer
base extends primarily from the United States to countries in South America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
( EMEA ) and Asia. 

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and a subsidiary with a majority voting interest of 51.8% (48.2% is owned by non-controlling
interests) as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company,
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of the subsidiary
applicable to non-controlling interests. 

Non-controlling Interest in a Consolidated
Subsidiary  

As of September 30, 2016,
the non-controlling interest was $1,034,472, which represents a $69,449 decrease from $1,103,921 as of June 30, 2016. The decrease
was due to the net loss of subsidiary of $143,965 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, of which 48.2% was attributable
to the non-controlling interests. 

Segment Reporting  

Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 280,  Segment Reporting,  requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information
about their reportable operating segments.  We identify our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision
maker internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility.  We have
one reportable segment, consisting of the sale of wireless access products. 

We generate revenues from
four geographic areas, consisting of the United States, the Caribbean and South America, EMEA and Asia. The following enterprise-wide
disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following table
contains certain financial information by geographic area: 

Estimates   

The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying amounts of
financial instruments such as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt approximate the related fair values
due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. We invest our excess cash into financial instruments which management believes
are readily convertible into cash, such as money market funds and certificates of deposit. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

Based upon our review of our collection history as well as the current balances associated with all significant customers and
associated invoices, we do not believe an allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary as of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016. 

Revenue Recognition   

We recognize revenue in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605,  Revenue Recognition,  when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred
or services have been rendered. Accordingly, we recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment of the products to customers
or when the products are received by the customers in accordance with shipping or delivery terms. We provide a warranty for one
year from the shipment date, which is covered by our vendors pursuant to purchase agreements. Any net warranty related expenditures
made by us have not historically been material. Under our sales return policy, customers may generally return products that are
under warranty for repair or replacement. 

Cost of Goods Sold   

All costs associated with
our contract manufacturers, as well as distribution, fulfillment and repair services are included in our cost of goods sold. Cost
of goods sold also includes amortization expense associated with capitalized product development costs associated with complete
technology. 

Capitalized Product Development Costs  

ASC Topic 350,  Intangibles
  Goodwill and Other  includes software that is part of a product or process to be sold to a customer and shall be
accounted for under Subtopic 985-20. Our products contain embedded software internally developed by FTI, which is an
integral part of these products because it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other and the
products are clearly unable to function without this coding. 

The costs of product development
that are capitalized once technological feasibility is determined (noted as Technology in progress in the Intangible Assets table)
include certifications, licenses, payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development.
We determine that technological feasibility for our products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved.
Once the products are available for general release to our customers, we cease capitalizing the product development costs and any
additional costs, if any, are expensed. The capitalized product development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using
the greater of straight-line amortization or the ratio of the current gross revenues to the current and anticipated future gross
revenues. The amortization begins when the products are available for general release to our customers. 

As of September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, capitalized product development costs in progress were $207,500 and $157,492, respectively, and these amounts
are included in intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred
$82,500 in capitalized product development costs, and such amounts are primarily comprised of certifications and licenses. All
costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are expensed and included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive
income (loss). 

Research and Development Costs  

Costs associated with research
and development are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs were $802,382 and $722,569 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Warranties  

We provide a warranty for
one year which is covered by our vendors and manufacturers under purchase agreements between the Company and the vendors. As a
result, we believe we do not have any net warranty exposure and do not accrue any warranty expenses. Historically, the Company
has not experienced any material net warranty expenditures. 

Shipping and Handling Costs  

Costs associated with product
shipping and handling are expensed as incurred. Shipping and handling costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), were $317,811 and $214,560 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

For purposes of the consolidated
statements of cash flow, we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. 

Inventories  

Our inventories consist
of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We assess
the inventory carrying value and reduce it, if necessary, to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand, and internal
demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available. Our customer demand is highly unpredictable,
and can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the Company. We may write down our inventory value for
potential obsolescence and excess inventory. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we have recorded an inventory reserve
in the amount of $90,917 for inventories that we have identified as obsolete or slow-moving. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment
are recorded at cost. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives of assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as
follows: 

Machinery 
     6 years  
 
     Office equipment 
     5 years  
 
     Molds 
     3 years  
 
     Vehicles 
     5 years  
 
     Computers and software 
     5 years  
 
     Furniture and fixtures 
     7 years  
 
     Facilities 
     5 years or life of the lease, whichever is shorter  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill and certain intangible
assets were recorded in connection with the FTI acquisition in October 2009, and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805,
 Business Combinations.   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and intangible net assets acquired.  Intangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.   Goodwill
and other intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and any related impairment losses are recognized in earnings
when identified. No impairment was recognized during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

The definite lived intangible
assets consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016: 

The definite lived intangible
assets consisted of the following as of June 30, 2016: 

Amortization expense recognized during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $126,483 and $254,346, respectively. 

Long-lived Assets  

In accordance with ASC
360,  Property, Plant, and Equipment,  we review for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. We consider the carrying value
of assets may not be recoverable based upon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset s ability
to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the
asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry
or economic trends.  An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the long-lived assets are impaired. 

Stock-based Compensation  

The Company s employee
share-based awards result in a cost that is measured at fair value on an award s grant date, based on the estimated number
of awards that are expected to vest. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the award s vesting
period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Transactions with non-employees
in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty's performance
is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur. Stock-based compensation costs are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income based upon the underlying recipients' roles within the Company. 

Income Taxes  

The Company uses the asset
and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred
tax assets, unless it is more likely than not such assets will be realized. Current income taxes are based on the year s
taxable income for federal and state income tax reporting purposes and the annual change in deferred taxes. 

The Company assesses its
income tax positions and records tax benefits based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information
available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained,
the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more
likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. The Company classifies
interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we have no material unrecognized tax benefits. We recorded an income tax provision of $135,122 and $5,065 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an increase in income tax payable of $151,118 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

Earnings per Share Attributable to Common
Stockholders  

Earnings per share is calculated
by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares that were outstanding for the period, without consideration
for potential common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income by the sum of the weighted-average
number of dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method or the as-converted
method. Potentially dilutive shares are comprised of common stock options outstanding under our stock plan. 

Concentrations   

We extend credit to our
customers and perform ongoing credit evaluations of such customers. We evaluate our accounts receivable on a regular basis for
collectability and provide for an allowance for potential credit losses as deemed necessary.  No reserve was required
or recorded for any of the periods presented. 

Substantially all of our
revenues are derived from sales of wireless data products.  Any significant decline in market acceptance of our products
or in the financial condition of our existing customers could impair our ability to operate effectively. 

A significant portion of
our revenue is derived from a small number of customers. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, sales to our two largest
customers accounted for 63%, and 35% of our consolidated net sales and 62%, and 36% of our accounts receivable balance, as of September
30, 2016. In the same period in 2015, sales to our two largest customers accounted for 84% and 13% of our consolidated net sales
and 85% and 5% of our accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2015. No other customers accounted for more than ten percent
of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and no other customers accounted for more than ten percent
of total accounts receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we purchased the majority of our wireless data products from one manufacturing company located in Asia. If
this manufacturing company were to experience delays, capacity constraints or quality control problems, product shipments to our
customers could be delayed, or our customers could consequently elect to cancel the underlying product purchase order, which would
negatively impact the Company's revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased wireless data products
from this manufacturer in the amount of $10,038,063, or 99% of total purchases, and had related accounts payable of $10,047,423
as of September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased wireless data products from one manufacturing
company in the amount of $9,615,790, or 100% of total purchases, and had related accounts payable of $8,039,726 as of September
30, 2015. 

We maintain our cash accounts
with established commercial banks.  Such cash deposits exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of $250,000
for each financial institution.  However, we do not anticipate any losses on excess deposits. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In July 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be
subsequently measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the market value approach. Net
realizable value is defined as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 will be effective for us beginning
in our first quarter of fiscal 2017, and is applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosure. 

In November 2015, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2015-17), which amends existing standards for deferred taxes to present all deferred tax assets
and liabilities as noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which amends existing standards for leases
to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring recognition of lease assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about such arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us beginning
in our first quarter of fiscal 2020, early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard
on our consolidated financial statements and the timing and presentation of our adoption. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (ASU 2016-09), which provides
guidance improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. The standard amends several aspects of current employee share-based
payment accounting including income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, early adoption
is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and
the timing and presentation of our adoption. 

In April 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(ASU 2016-10), which amends
and adds clarity to certain aspects of the guidance set forth in the upcoming revenue standard (ASU 2014-09) related to identifying
performance obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition
(Topic 605), which amends and rescinds certain revenue recognition guidance previously released within ASU 2014-09. In May 2016
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(ASU 2016-12), which
provides narrow scope improvements and practical expedients related to ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
these new standards on our consolidated financial statements. All of these new standards will be effective for us concurrently
with ASU 2014-09, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, early adoption is not permitted.

used to compute earnings per share is as follows: 

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Leases  

We leased approximately
11,318 square feet of office space located in San Diego, California, at a monthly rent of $16,576; although the lease expired on
August 31, 2015, we continued to occupy the premises with the consent of the landlord through October 27, 2015. On September 9,
2015, we signed a lease for new office space consisting of approximately 12,775 square feet, also located in San Diego, California,
at a monthly rent of $23,115, which commenced on October 28, 2015. In addition to monthly rent, the new lease includes payment
for certain common area costs. The term of the lease for the new office space is four years from the lease commencement date. Our
facility is covered by an appropriate level of insurance and we believe it to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present
needs. Rent expense related to these leases was $69,344 and $60,316 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Our Korea-based subsidiary,
FTI, leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space in Seoul, Korea, at a monthly rent of approximately $8,000, and the
lease expires on September 1, 2017. Beginning on June 12, 2015, FTI leased additional office space consisting of approximately
2,682 square feet, also located in Seoul, Korea, at a monthly rent of approximately $2,700, and the lease expires on September
1, 2017. In addition to monthly rent, the lease provides for periodic cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for
certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate level of insurance and we believe them to be suitable
for our use and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense related to these leases was approximately $32,100 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We lease one corporate
housing facility for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that expired on September 13, 2015 and was
extended to September 5, 2017. Rent expense related to this lease was $2,560 and $2,436 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. 

Litigation  

We are from time to time
involved in certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. 

Novatel Wireless, Inc.  

On December 10, 2010,
Novatel Wireless, Inc. and Novatel Wireless Solutions, Inc. ( Novatel ) filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of California, against us and one other defendant. The complaint alleges that certain products,
including, but not limited to, mobile data hot spots and data modems, infringe on U.S. Patent Nos. 5,129,098; 7,318,225; 7,574,737
and 7,319,715. On April 13, 2012, the plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint which amended certain claims and added U.S. Patent
No. 7,944,901 to the original complaint. On April 27, 2012, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint as to certain
of the claims. On July 6, 2012, the Court held oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss and on July 19, 2012, the Court issued an
order granting in part and denying in part the Motion to Dismiss. On August 2, 2012, we answered the complaint and an Early Neutral
Evaluation Conference took place on October 31, 2012 and a follow-up Settlement Conference was held on June 12, 2013. A claim construction
hearing took place on October 9, 2014. On November 25, 2014, the Court granted plaintiff's Joint Motion to Joinder of Required
Party, which added Nova Intellectual Solutions, LLC ( NIS ) as a plaintiff to this litigation. Novatel had previously
assigned the patents-in-suit to Strategic Intellectual Solutions, LLC, which is the parent company of NIS. 

On April 24, 2015, NIS
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, against us and FTI. The complaint
alleges that one of the Company's products infringes on U.S. Patent No. 7,944,901. 

On July 20, 2015, a Settlement
Conference took place during which we and NIS agreed to settle this matter and an agreement governing the settlement was executed
on October 20, 2015. 

On October 1, 2015, we
and Novatel filed a Joint Motion For Dismissal With Prejudice as to the patent infringement claims made by Novatel against us.
On October 28, 2015, we and NIS filed a Joint Motion For Dismissal With Prejudice as to the patent infringement claims made by
it against the Company and FTI. 

Adaptix, Inc.  

In October 2015 we were
notified that on June 12, 2015, Adaptix, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas, Tyler Division against one of our customers. The complaint alleges that certain wireless devices, including one device provided
by the Company, infringe on U.S. Patent No. 8,934,375. On July 12, 2016, the case was dismissed following settlement by the parties
to the litigation. 

TC Technology LLC  

In June 2016 we were notified
that on March 10, 2016, TC Technology LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against
one of our customers. The complaint alleges that certain voice, data and text services provided by the customer infringe on U.S.
Patent No. 5,815,488. The complaint does not identify any products provided by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, this legal
proceeding is pending, but we do not believe that this action will have a material effect on the Company. 

Change of Control Agreements  

On September 21, 2009 we
entered into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim, our President, Yun J. (David) Lee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Yong
Bae Won, our Vice President, Engineering. Each Change of Control Agreement provides for a lump sum payment to the officer in case
of a change of control of the Company. The term includes the acquisition of Common Stock of the Company resulting in one person
or company owning more than 50% of the outstanding shares, a significant change in the composition of the Board of Directors of
the Company during any 12-month period, a reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in the transfer
of ownership of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or sale
of substantially all of the Company's assets. 

The Change of Control Agreement
with Mr. Kim calls for a payment of $5 million upon a change of control; the agreement with Mr. Lee calls for a payment of $2 million
upon a change of control; and the agreement with Mr. Won was for two years and called for a payment of $1 million upon a change
of control. 

The Board of Directors
has approved extension of the Change of Control Agreements with Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee, through September 21, 2017. The Change of
Control Agreement with Mr. Won expired on September 21, 2014 and was not renewed or extended. 

NOTE 8   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
AWARDS  

We adopted the 2009 Stock
Incentive Plan ( 2009 Plan ) on June 11, 2009, which provided for the grant of incentive stock options and non-qualified
stock options to our employees and directors. Options granted under the 2009 Plan generally have a term of ten years and generally
vest and become exercisable at the rate of 33% after one year and 33% on the second and third anniversaries of the option grant
dates. Historically, some stock option grants have included shorter vesting periods ranging from one to two years. 

The estimated forfeiture
rate considers historical turnover rates stratified into employee pools in comparison with an overall employee turnover rate, as
well as expectations about the future. We periodically revise the estimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. Compensation expense recorded under this method for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was
($12,500). The expense credit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the reversal of expenses booked in prior
periods for stock options for a small number of employees that were cancelled. This amount increased income from operations and
income before provision for income taxes by the same amount by decreasing compensation expense recognized in selling, general and
administrative expense. 

A summary of the status
of our stock options is presented below:  

The aggregate intrinsic
value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based upon the Company s closing stock price of
$2.32 as of September 30, 2016, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options
as of that date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2016, in the amount
of 777,003 shares, was $1.13 per share. 

As of September 30, 2016,
there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted. 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this report. This report contains certain forward-looking statements relating to
future events or our future financial performance.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this report.  You are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on this information, which speaks only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly update
this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do
so in connection with our obligation to file reports with the SEC. For a discussion of the important risks to our business and
future operating performance, see the discussion under the caption  Item 1A. Risk Factors  and under the caption  Factors
That May Influence Future Results of Operations  in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed
on September 28, 2016.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed
in this report might not occur. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

We are a provider of intelligent
wireless solutions including mobile hotspots, routers and modems as well as innovative hardware and software products that support
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our M2M and IoT solutions include embedded modules, modems
and gateways built to deliver reliable always-on connectivity supporting a broad spectrum of applications. These products are designed
to solve wireless connectivity challenges in a variety of vertical markets including video surveillance, digital signage, home
security, oil and gas exploration, kiosks, fleet management, smart grid, vehicle diagnostics, telematics and many more. 

We have a majority ownership
position in FTI, a research and development company located in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development
services to us for our wireless products. 

Our products are generally
marketed and sold directly to wireless operators, and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer
base extends primarily from the United States to countries in South America, the Caribbean, EMEA and Asia. 

FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

We believe that our revenue
growth will be influenced largely by (1) the successful maintenance of our existing customers, (2) the rate of increase in demand
for wireless data products, (3) customer acceptance of our new products, (4) new customer relationships and contracts, and (5)
our ability to meet customers  demands. 

We have entered into and
expect to continue to enter into new customer relationships and contracts for the supply of our products, and this may require
significant demands on our resources, resulting in increased operating, selling, and marketing expenses associated with such new
customers. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our
estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information. The results of
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

We have several critical
accounting policies, which were described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, that are both
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult,
subjective and complex judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have
to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There were no material changes to our critical
accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table sets
forth, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our statements of comprehensive income including data expressed
as a percentage of sales: 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED
TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

NET SALES  - Net
sales increased by $756,008, or 6.3%, to $12,704,474 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $11,948,466 for the corresponding
period of 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of the United States,
South America and the Caribbean, EMEA and Asia, were $12,522,650 (98.6% of net sales), $0, $128,103 (1.0% of net sales) and $53,721
(0.4% of net sales), respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of
the United States, South America and the Caribbean, EMEA and Asia, were $10,110,335 (84.6% of net sales), $93,000 (0.8% of net
sales), $1,742,203 (14.6% of net sales) and $2,928 (0.0% of net sales), respectively. 

Net sales in the United
States increased by $2,412,315, or 23.9%, to $12,522,650 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $10,110,335 for the
corresponding period of 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the launch of a new product with a carrier customer.
Net sales in the South American and Caribbean regions decreased by $93,000, or 100%, to $0 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $93,000 for the corresponding period of 2015. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the
general nature of sales in these regions, which often fluctuate significantly from period to period due to timing of orders placed
by a relatively small number of customers. Net sales in EMEA decreased by $1,614,100, or 92.6%, to $128,103 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $1,742,203 for the corresponding period of 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to timing of orders
placed by a carrier customer in Africa. Net sales in Asia increased by $50,793 to $53,721 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $2,928 for the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher product and component
sales generated by FTI, which typically vary from period to period. 

GROSS PROFIT   
Gross profit increased by $298,404, or 15.2%, to $2,261,411 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,963,007 for the
corresponding period of 2015.  The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 17.8% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to 16.4% for the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the
change in net sales as described above. The increase in gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was primarily due to variations
in customer and product mix, competitive selling prices and product costs which generally vary from period to period and region
to region. 

OPERATING EXPENSES 
- Operating expenses increased by $16,494, or 0.9%, to $1,893,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,877,445
for the corresponding period of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to higher shipping and handling costs resulting from
the volume increase in product shipments and higher research and development expenses, which were partially offset by lower expenses
associated with third party contractors, depreciation, amortization, legal and travel. 

OTHER LOSS, NET 
- Other loss, net decreased by $3,755, or 8.7%, to $39,258 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $43,013 for the corresponding
period of 2015. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Our historical operating
results, capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, were considered in management's
plan and intentions to fund our operations over a reasonable period of time, which we define as the twelve month period ending
September 30, 2017.  For purposes of liquidity disclosures, we assess the likelihood that we have sufficient available working
capital and other principal sources of liquidity to fund our operating activities and obligations as they become due. 

Our principal source of
liquidity as of September 30, 2016 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $10,936,994.  We believe we have sufficient available
capital to cover our existing operations and obligations through at least September 30, 2017. Our long-term future cash requirements
will depend on numerous factors, including our revenue base, profit margins, product development activities, market acceptance
of our products, future expansion plans and ability to control costs. If we are unable to achieve our current business plan
or secure additional funding that may be required, we would need to curtail our operations or take other similar actions outside
the ordinary course of business in order to continue to operate as a going concern. 

OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
- Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,200,389 and $142,595, respectively. 

The $2,200,389 in net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable
of $2,699,632, which was partially offset by our operating results (net income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other
non-cash charges). The $142,595 in net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily
due to the increase in accounts receivable of $2,630,355, which was partially offset by the increases in accounts payable and advance
payments from customers of $1,384,104 and $553,113, respectively, as well as our operating results (net income adjusted for depreciation,
amortization and other non-cash charges). 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $127,591 and $151,577,
respectively. 

The $127,591 in net cash
used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the payments for capitalized product
development of $82,500 as well as the purchase of intangible assets of $44,161. The $151,577 in net cash used in investing activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the payments for capitalized product development of $138,912. 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $47,100 and $0, respectively.
The $47,100 in net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the cash received
from the exercise of stock options. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

Leases  

We leased approximately
11,318 square feet of office space located in San Diego, California, at a monthly rent of $16,576; although the lease expired on
August 31, 2015, we continued to occupy the premises with the consent of the landlord through October 27, 2015. On September 9,
2015, we signed a lease for new office space consisting of approximately 12,775 square feet, also located in San Diego, California,
at a monthly rent of $23,115, which commenced on October 28, 2015. In addition to monthly rent, the new lease includes payment
for certain common area costs. The term of the lease for the new office space is four years from the lease commencement date. Our
facility is covered by an appropriate level of insurance and we believe it to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present
needs. Rent expense related to these leases was $69,344 and $60,316 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Our Korea-based subsidiary,
FTI, leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space in Seoul, Korea, at a monthly rent of approximately $8,000, and the
lease expires on September 1, 2017. Beginning on June 12, 2015, FTI leased additional office space consisting of approximately
2,682 square feet, also located in Seoul, Korea, at a monthly rent of approximately $2,700, and the lease expires on September
1, 2017. In addition to monthly rent, the lease provides for periodic cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for
certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate level of insurance and we believe them to be suitable
for our use and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense related to these leases was approximately $32,100 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We lease one corporate
housing facility for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that expired on September 13, 2015 and was
extended to September 5, 2017. Rent expense related to this lease was $2,560 and $2,436 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.
