FERRELLGAS PARTNERS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, except per unit data, unless otherwise designated) 
   (unaudited) 
   
  A.    Partnership organization and formation 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. ( Ferrellgas Partners ) was formed   April 19, 1994  , and is a publicly traded limited partnership, owning an approximate   99%   limited partner interest in Ferrellgas, L.P. (the "operating partnership"). Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, collectively referred to as  Ferrellgas,  are both Delaware limited partnerships and are governed by their respective partnership agreements. Ferrellgas Partners was formed to acquire and hold a limited partner interest in the operating partnership. As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrell Companies, Inc. ("Ferrell Companies") beneficially owns   22.8 million   Ferrellgas Partners common units. Ferrellgas, Inc. (the "general partner"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrell Companies, has retained an approximate   1%   general partner interest in Ferrellgas Partners and also holds an approximate   1%   general partner interest in the operating partnership, representing an effective   2%   general partner interest in Ferrellgas on a combined basis. As general partner, it performs all management functions required by Ferrellgas. Unless contractually provided for, creditors of the operating partnership have no recourse with regards to Ferrellgas Partners. 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has   two   subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners owns a   100%   equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., whose only business activity is to act as the co-issuer and co-obligor of debt issued by Ferrellgas Partners. The operating partnership is the only operating subsidiary of Ferrellgas Partners.  
    
  Ferrellgas is engaged in the following primary businesses: 
             
    Propane and related equipment sales consists of the distribution of propane and related equipment and supplies. The propane distribution market is seasonal because propane is used primarily for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Ferrellgas serves residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all   50   states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
                
    Midstream operations consists of one reportable operating segment: crude oil logistics. The crude oil logistics segment ("Bridger") primarily generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil. Bridger services include transportation through its operation of a fleet of trucks, tank trailers, railcars, pipeline injection stations and a barge. Bridger primarily operates in major oil and gas basins across the continental United States.  Bridger also enters into crude oil purchase and sale arrangements. 
       
  Due to seasonality, the results of operations for the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending   July 31, 2017  .  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented. All adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements were of a normal recurring nature. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with (i) the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and (ii) the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Ferrellgas' Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal   2016  . 

B.      Summary of significant accounting policies 
    
  (1)        Accounting estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates impacting the consolidated financial statements include accruals that have been established for contingent liabilities, pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business, useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets, residual values of tanks, capitalization of customer tank installation costs, amortization methods of intangible assets, valuation methods used to value sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of reporting units, recoverability of long-lived assets, assumptions used to value business combinations, fair values of derivative contracts and stock-based compensation calculations.

(2) New accounting standards: 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The issuance is part of a joint effort by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") to enhance financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and, thereby, improving the consistency of requirements, comparability of practices and usefulness of disclosures. The new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. The standard and related amendments will be effective for Ferrellgas for its annual reporting period beginning August 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect. Ferrellgas is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance, including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-02 and No. 2016-17 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   which provides additional guidance on the consolidation of limited partnerships and on the evaluation of variable interest entities. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Consolidation: Interests Held through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control   which amended certain aspects of the additional guidance in ASU 2015-02. We adopted ASU 2015-02 and ASU 2016-17 effective August 1, 2016. The adoption of these standards did not impact our consolidated financial statements  . 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-11 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,   which requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Ferrellgas is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Ferrellgas is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.   

C.   Significant transactions 
    
  Termination of Bridger agreement with Jamex Marketing, LLC 
    
  In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Bridger in June 2015, Bridger entered into a ten-year transportation and logistics agreement (the  Jamex TLA ) with Jamex pursuant to which Jamex would be responsible for certain payments to Bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for Bridger s largest customer at that time.  
    
  As a result of concerns regarding the collectability of amounts owed to Bridger from Jamex under the Jamex TLA and certain other matters between Bridger and Jamex, Bridger, Jamex, Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the Jamex TLA, facilitated Ferrellgas purchasing certain Ferrellgas common units from Jamex, and established payment terms for certain amounts owed by Jamex to Bridger under the Jamex TLA. Consequently, Ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, Bridger and Ferrellgas entered into a Termination, Settlement and Release Agreement (the  Jamex Termination Agreement ) with Jamex, certain of Jamex's affiliates, and James Ballengee (the owner of Jamex) pursuant to which: 
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    Jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note in favor of Bridger in original principal amount of   $49.5 million   (the "Jamex Secured Promissory Note") in satisfaction of all obligations owed to Bridger under the Jamex TLA; 
              (2) 
    Mr. Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee, executed and delivered a joint guarantee of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note obligations up to a maximum aggregate amount of   $20.0 million  ; 
              (3) 
    The operating partnership agreed to provide Jamex with a   $5.0 million   revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note (the  Jamex Revolving Promissory Note  and, together with the Jamex Secured Promissory Note, the  Jamex Notes  
              (4) 
    The other Jamex entities agreed to execute and deliver a security agreement and a full guarantee of the obligations under the Jamex Notes; 
              (5) 
    Ferrellgas paid approximately   $16.9 million   to Jamex and in return received   0.9 million   of Ferrellgas Partners' common units, which were cancelled upon receipt, and approximately   23 thousand   barrels of crude oil; 
              (6) 
    The parties agreed to terminate the Jamex TLA and certain other commercial agreements and arrangements between them, and release any claims between or among them that may exist (other than those arising under the Jamex Termination Agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the Jamex Termination Agreement); and  
              (7) 
    Ferrellgas waived the remaining lockup provision applicable to Jamex under the Registration Rights Agreement dated June 24, 2015 to which Jamex is party.  
       
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note originally had an annual interest rate of   7%   (which rate would be reduced under certain circumstances, including if Ferrellgas' quarterly distributions are less than   $0.25   per common unit; accordingly, as a result of the distribution declared on November 22, 2016, the interest rate will decrease to   2.8%  ), and contemplates quarterly amortizing principal payments, together with payments of accrued interest. The first payment, due December 17, 2016, will be an interest-only payment. The maturity date of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note will be December 17, 2021. Jamex will be allowed to prepay the Secured Promissory Note in whole or in part at any time. 
    
  The Jamex Revolving Promissory Note, which provides Jamex with access to working capital liquidity to meet their unrelated and ongoing crude oil marketing and other business needs, has an annual interest rate of   0%   (which rate would be increased in case of a default), and contains certain conditions precedent to the operating partnership s obligation to make any advances thereunder. Each borrowing under the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note must be repaid within   10   days, and the ultimate maturity date of the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note is the earlier of September 1, 2021 and the date on which all obligations under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note are repaid. 
    
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note is guaranteed, pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, jointly by James Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee (up to a maximum aggregate amount of   $20.0 million  ), and each Note is fully guaranteed, pursuant to respective Guaranty Agreements, by the other Jamex entities. The obligations of Jamex and the other Jamex entities under the Notes are secured, pursuant to a Security Agreement, by a lien on certain of those entities  assets, including common units, actively traded marketable securities and cash, which are held in a controlled account that can be seized by Ferrellgas in the event of default. 
    
  During the year ended July 31, 2016, approximately   60%   of Midstream Operations - Crude oil logistics' segment (Bridger) gross margin was generated from its largest customer and Jamex, that customer's supplier, under take-or-pay arrangements. Bridger s largest customer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 owned a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania. Bridger was party to an agreement with this customer under which Bridger provided logistics services to transport crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota to the Trainer refinery. That agreement had a minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery for logistics services associated with the delivery of   65   MBbls/d. However, if the quantity of crude oil delivered to the refinery dropped below   35   MBbls/d, the minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery would be suspended and Jamex would become responsible for payments to Bridger under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During February 2016, Jamex ceased sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery and since that time Bridger had been billing Jamex directly in accordance with the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During July 2016, Ferrellgas determined Jamex would not resume sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery or be likely to continue to make payments under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. As a result, Ferrellgas negotiated a settlement with Jamex, and the Jamex TLA was terminated on September 1, 2016. While the agreement with the refinery owner was not terminated as a result of the execution and delivery of the Jamex Termination Agreement, Bridger has been unable to negotiate a revised transportation and logistics agreement with that customer; accordingly it is unlikely that Bridger will continue to make any deliveries under the existing agreement. Consequently, we do not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or gross margin from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future.

E.      Accounts and notes receivable, net and accounts receivable securitization 
    
  Accounts and notes receivable, net consist of the following: 

On September 27, 2016, Ferrellgas entered into a fourth amendment to its accounts receivable securitization facility to modify the maximum leverage ratio covenant as follows:  

The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in Ferrellgas' secured credit facility. Ferrellgas' leverage ratio was   5.81  x as of October 31, 2016.  
    
  At   October 31, 2016  ,   $105.3   million of trade accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against   $74.0   million of collateralized notes payable due to the commercial paper conduit. At   July 31, 2016  , $  106.5   million of trade accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against   $64.0   million of collateralized notes payable due to the commercial paper conduit. These accounts receivable pledged as collateral are bankruptcy remote from the operating partnership. The operating partnership does not provide any guarantee or similar support to the collectability of these accounts receivable pledged as collateral.  
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had received cash proceeds of   $74.0   million from trade accounts receivables securitized, with   no   remaining capacity to receive additional proceeds. As of   July 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had received cash proceeds of   $64.0   million from trade accounts receivables securitized, with   no   remaining capacity to receive additional proceeds. Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility had a weighted average interest rate of   2.7%   and   3.0%   as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Ferrellgas classified a portion of its secured credit facility borrowings as short-term because it was used to fund working capital needs that management had intended to pay down within the 12 month period following each balance sheet date. As of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  ,   $96.8 million   and   $101.3 million  , respectively, were classified as short-term borrowings. For further discussion see the secured credit facility section below. 
    
  Secured credit facility 
    
  On September 27, 2016, Ferrellgas entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility to modify the maximum leverage ratio covenant as follows: 

The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in Ferrellgas' secured credit facility. Ferrellgas' leverage ratio was   5.81  x as of   October 31, 2016  , which equates to headroom of   $78.9 million   or   4.0%  . Because of this leverage ratio requirement Ferrellgas continues to execute on a strategy to reduce its debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to its leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in Ferrellgas' annual distribution, which was reduced during the quarter ended   October 31, 2016   from an annualized rate of   $2.05   to   $0.40   per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until Ferrellgas' leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that Ferrellgas deems appropriate for its business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, Ferrellgas believes it is possible its leverage ratio will exceed   5.95  x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had total borrowings outstanding under its secured credit facility of   $415.0 million  , of which   $318.2 million   was classified as long-term debt. Ferrellgas had   $173.6 million   of capacity under our secured credit facility as of   October 31, 2016  . However, the leverage ratio covenant under this facility limits additional borrowings to   $78.9 million   as of   October 31, 2016  . As of   July 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had total borrowings outstanding under its secured credit facility of   $394.4 million  , of which   $293.1 million   was classified as long-term debt. Ferrellgas had   $219.3 million   of capacity under our secured credit facility as of   July 31, 2016  . However, the leverage ratio covenant under this facility limited additional borrowings to   $8.1 million   as of   July 31, 2016  . Borrowings outstanding at   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016   under the secured credit facility had weighted average interest rates of   4.1%   and   3.7%  , respectively. 
     
  The obligations under this credit facility are secured by substantially all assets of Ferrellgas, the general partner and certain subsidiaries of Ferrellgas but specifically excluding (a) assets that are subject to Ferrellgas  accounts receivable securitization facility, (b) the general partner s equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners and (c) equity interests in certain unrestricted subsidiaries. Such obligations are also guaranteed by the general partner and certain subsidiaries of Ferrellgas. 
    
  Letters of credit outstanding at   October 31, 2016   totaled   $111.4 million   and were used primarily to secure insurance arrangements and, to a lesser extent, product purchases. Letters of credit outstanding at   July 31, 2016   totaled   $86.3 million   and were used primarily to secure insurance arrangements and, to a lesser extent, product purchases. At   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had remaining letter of credit capacity of   $88.6 million  . At   July 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had remaining letter of credit capacity of   $113.7 million  .

G.    Partners' deficit 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , limited partner units were beneficially owned by the following: 

(1) 
    These common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  FGP.  
     (2)  Ferrell Companies is the owner of the general partner and is an approximate   23%   direct owner of Ferrellgas Partners' common units and thus a related party. Ferrell Companies also beneficially owns   195,686   and   51,204   common units of Ferrellgas Partners held by FCI Trading Corp. ("FCI Trading") and Ferrell Propane, Inc. ("Ferrell Propane"), respectively, bringing Ferrell Companies' beneficial ownership to   23.4%   at   October 31, 2016  . 
  (3)  FCI Trading is an affiliate of the general partner and thus a related party.  
  (4)  Ferrell Propane is controlled by the general partner and thus a related party.  
  (5)  James E. Ferrell is the Interim Chief Executive Officer and President of the general partner; and is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the general partner and thus a related party. JEF Capital Management owns   4,758,859   of these common units and is wholly-owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust Two for which James E. Ferrell is the trustee and sole beneficiary. The remaining   4,616   common units are held by Ferrell Resources Holding, Inc., which is wholly-owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust One, for which James E. Ferrell is the trustee and sole beneficiary. 
    
  Partnership distributions paid 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners has paid the following distributions: 

On   November 22, 2016  , Ferrellgas Partners declared a cash distribution of   $0.10   per common unit for the three months ended   October 31, 2016  , which is expected to be paid on   December 15, 2016  . Included in this cash distribution are the following amounts to be paid to related parties:

General partner s commitment to maintain its capital account 
    
  Ferrellgas  partnership agreements allow the general partner to have an option to maintain its effective   2%   general partner interest concurrent with the issuance of other additional equity. 
    
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2016  , the general partner made non-cash contributions of   $0.1 million   to Ferrellgas to maintain its effective   2%   general partner interest. 
    
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2015  , the general partner made non-cash contributions of   $0.3 million   to Ferrellgas to maintain its effective   2%   general partner interest. 

H.        Fair value measurements 
    
  Derivative financial instruments  
    
  The following table presents Ferrellgas  financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, including both current and noncurrent portions, as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  : 

Methodology 
    
  The fair values of Ferrellgas  non-exchange traded commodity derivative contracts are based upon indicative price quotations available through brokers, industry price publications or recent market transactions and related market indicators. The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are based upon third-party quotes or indicative values based on recent market transactions.  

16 

     Table of Contents  

Other financial instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Jamex note receivable, a financial instrument classified in "Other assets, net" on the consolidated balance sheet, approximates fair value due to the market interest rate. At   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , the estimated fair value of Ferrellgas  long-term debt instruments was   $1,979.9 million   and   $1,920.1 million  , respectively. Ferrellgas estimates the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our consolidated debt obligations is a Level 2 valuation based on the observable inputs used for similar liabilities. 
    
  Ferrellgas has other financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable which could expose it to concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk from trade accounts receivable is limited because of a large customer base which extends across many different U.S. markets. 

I.    Derivative instruments and hedging activities 
    
  Ferrellgas is exposed to certain market risks related to its ongoing business operations. These risks include exposure to changing commodity prices as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Ferrellgas utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Of these, the propane commodity derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. All other commodity derivative instruments do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow hedges, therefore, the change in their fair value are recorded currently in earnings. Ferrellgas also periodically utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 
    
  Derivative instruments and hedging activity 
     
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   and 2015, Ferrellgas did   no  t recognize any gain or loss in earnings related to hedge ineffectiveness and did not exclude any component of financial derivative contract gains or losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to commodity cash flow hedges.

The changes in derivatives included in AOCI for the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   

Ferrellgas expects to reclassify net losses related to the risk management commodity derivatives of approximately   $1.4 million   to earnings during the next 12 months. These net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments Ferrellgas has with its customers that qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception. 
    
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had no reclassifications to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of any cash flow hedges arising from the probability of the original forecasted transactions not occurring within the originally specified period of time defined within the hedging relationship. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had financial derivative contracts covering   2.4 million   barrels of propane that were entered into as cash flow hedges of forward and forecasted purchases of propane. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had financial derivative contracts covering   0.1 million   barrels of diesel and   21 thousand   barrels of unleaded gasoline related to fuel hedges in transportation of propane. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas had financial derivative contracts covering   0.2 million   barrels of crude oil related to the hedging of crude oil line fill and inventory. 
    
  Derivative financial instruments credit risk 
    
  Ferrellgas is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments. Ferrellgas  counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major U.S. financial institutions. Ferrellgas maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that it believes reduce its overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring its counterparties  financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits. Certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by Ferrellgas in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. Ferrellgas has concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments held by certain derivative financial instrument counterparties. If these counterparties that make up the concentration failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts at   October 31, 2016  , the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative financial instruments, Ferrellgas would incur is $  2.7   million. 
    
  Ferrellgas holds certain derivative contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features which dictate credit limits based upon Ferrellgas' debt rating. As of   October 31, 2016  , a downgrade in Ferrellgas' debt rating could trigger a reduction in credit limit and would result in an additional collateral requirement of   zero  . There were   no   derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position on   October 31, 2016   and Ferrellgas had posted   no   collateral in the normal course of business related to such derivatives.  

J.        Transactions with related parties 
    
  Ferrellgas has   no   employees and is managed and controlled by its general partner. Pursuant to Ferrellgas  partnership agreements, the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of Ferrellgas and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to Ferrellgas or otherwise reasonably incurred by its general partner in connection with operating Ferrellgas  business. These costs primarily include compensation and benefits paid to employees of the general partner who perform services on Ferrellgas  behalf and are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as follows:

K.        Contingencies and commitments 
    
  Litigation 
    
  Ferrellgas  operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers of combustible liquids such as propane and crude oil. As a result, at any given time, Ferrellgas can be threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as discussed below, Ferrellgas is not a party to any legal proceedings other than various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters; however, management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Ferrellgas. 
    
  Ferrellgas has been named as a defendant, along with a competitor, in putative class action lawsuits filed in multiple jurisdictions. The lawsuits allege that Ferrellgas and a competitor coordinated in 2008 to reduce the fill level in barbeque cylinders and combined to persuade a common customer to accept that fill reduction, resulting in increased cylinder costs to direct customers and end-user customers in violation of federal and certain state antitrust laws. The lawsuits seek treble damages, attorneys  fees, injunctive relief and costs on behalf of the putative class. These lawsuits have been consolidated into one case by a multidistrict litigation panel.  The Court has dismissed all claims brought by direct and indirect customers other than state law claims of indirect customers under Wisconsin, Maine and Vermont law.  The direct customer plaintiffs have filed an appeal, which is pending.  Ferrellgas believes it has strong defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously defend against the consolidated case. Ferrellgas does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  In addition, putative class action cases have been filed in California relating to residual propane remaining in the tank after use.  Ferrellgas has prevailed at the trial court on a motion to dismiss those claims.  It is uncertain whether plaintiffs will appeal; Ferrellgas intends to vigorously defend any such appeal.  Ferrellgas does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  Ferrellgas has been named, along with several current and former officers, in several class action lawsuits alleging violations of certain securities laws based on alleged materially false and misleading statements in certain of our public disclosures.  The lawsuits, the first of which was filed on October 6, 2016 in the Southern District of New York, seek unspecified compensatory damages.  A derivative lawsuit with similar allegations has been filed in state court in Missouri naming Ferrellgas and several current and former officers and directors as defendants.  Ferrellgas believes that it has defenses and will vigorously defend these cases.  Ferrellgas does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuits or the derivative action. 
    
  On October 21, 2016, Julio E. Rios II, an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC, and Jeremy H. Gamboa, also an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the Chief Operating Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC both delivered notice of "good reason" for resignation to the general partner pursuant to their employment agreements alleging that the general partner had materially diminished their responsibilities and stating their intention to resign as a result if such purported material diminution is not cured within 30 days.  
    
  On November 28, 2016, Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa each resigned from their positions, purportedly for "good reason" pursuant to their employment agreements.  Each has indicated that they intend to make a claim for severance.  The general partner denies that Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa had "good reason" to resign and has other defenses to their claims for severance.  Ferrellgas does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to this matter.  

L.        Net earnings per common unitholders  interest 
    
  Below is a calculation of the basic and diluted net earnings per common unitholders  interest in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated. Ferrellgas calculates net earnings (loss) per common unitholders  interest for each period presented according to distributions declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings, as if all of the

earnings or loss for the period had been distributed according to the incentive distribution rights in the Ferrellgas partnership agreement. Due to the seasonality of the propane business, the dilutive effect of the two-class method typically impacts only the three months ending January 31. In periods with undistributed earnings above certain levels, the calculation according to the two-class method results in an increased allocation of undistributed earnings to the general partner and a dilution of the earnings to the limited partners as follows: 

There was no dilutive effect resulting from this method based on basic and diluted net earnings per common unitholders' interest for the three months ended   October 31, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  In periods with net losses, the allocation of the net losses to the limited partners and the general partner will be determined based on the same allocation basis specified in Ferrellgas Partners  partnership agreement that would apply to periods in which there were no undistributed earnings. Additionally, there are no dilutive securities in periods with net losses.

FERRELLGAS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise designated) 
      (unaudited) 
   
  A.      Partnership organization and formation 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. is a limited partnership that owns and operates propane distribution and related assets, crude oil transportation and logistics related assets and salt water disposal wells in south Texas. Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. ( Ferrellgas Partners ), a publicly traded limited partnership, holds an approximate   99%   limited partner interest in, and consolidates, Ferrellgas, L.P. Ferrellgas, Inc. (the  general partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrell Companies, Inc. ( Ferrell Companies ), holds an approximate   1%   general partner interest in Ferrellgas, L.P. and performs all management functions required by Ferrellgas, L.P.  
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. owns a   100%   equity interest in Ferrellgas Finance Corp., whose only business activity is to act as the co-issuer and co-obligor of debt issued by Ferrellgas, L.P. 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. is engaged in the following primary businesses: 
             
    Propane and related equipment sales consists of the distribution of propane and related equipment and supplies. The propane distribution market is seasonal because propane is used primarily for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Ferrellgas, L.P. serves residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all   50   states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
                
    Midstream operations consists of one reportable operating segment: crude oil logistics. The crude oil logistics segment ("Bridger") primarily generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil. Bridger services include transportation through its operation of a fleet of trucks, tank trailers, railcars, pipeline injection terminals, and a barge. Bridger primarily operates in major oil and gas basins across the continental United States.  Bridger also enters into crude oil purchase and sale arrangements. 
       
  Due to seasonality, the results of operations for the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2017.  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas, L.P. and subsidiaries reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented. All adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements were of a normal recurring nature. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with (i) the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and (ii) the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Ferrellgas, L.P. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal   2016  . 

B.      Summary of significant accounting policies 
    
  (1)        Accounting estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates impacting the consolidated financial statements include accruals that have been established for contingent liabilities, pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business, useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets, residual values of tanks, capitalization of customer tank installation costs, amortization methods of intangible assets, valuation methods used to value sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of reporting units, recoverability of long-lived assets, assumptions used to value business combinations, fair values of derivative contracts and stock-based compensation calculations. 
    
  (2) New accounting standards: 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The issuance is part of a joint effort by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") to enhance financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and, thereby, improving the consistency of requirements, comparability of practices and usefulness of disclosures. The new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. The standard and related amendments will be effective for Ferrellgas for its annual reporting period beginning August 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect.  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Ferrellgas is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance, including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-02 and No. 2016-17 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   which provides additional guidance on the consolidation of limited partnerships and on the evaluation of variable interest entities. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Consolidation: Interests Held through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control   which amended certain aspects of the additional guidance in ASU 2015-02. We adopted ASU 2015-02 and ASU 2016-17 effective August 1, 2016. The adoption of these standards did not impact our consolidated financial statements  . 
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-11 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,   which requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Ferrellgas, L.P. is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Ferrellgas is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.   

C.   Significant transactions 
    
  Termination of Bridger agreement with Jamex Marketing, LLC 
    
  In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Bridger in June 2015, Bridger entered into a ten-year transportation and logistics agreement (the  Jamex TLA ) with Jamex pursuant to which Jamex would be responsible for certain payments to Bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for Bridger s largest customer at that time.  
    
  As a result of concerns regarding the collectability of amounts owed to Bridger from Jamex under the Jamex TLA and certain other matters between Bridger and Jamex, Bridger, Jamex, Ferrellgas Partners and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the Jamex TLA, facilitated Ferrellgas Partners purchasing certain Ferrellgas Partners common units from Jamex, and established payment terms for certain amounts owed by Jamex to Bridger under the Jamex TLA. Consequently, Ferrellgas Partners does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, Bridger and Ferrellgas Partners entered into a Termination, Settlement and Release Agreement (the  Jamex Termination Agreement ) with Jamex, certain of Jamex's affiliates, and James Ballengee (the owner of Jamex) pursuant to which: 
    
           (1) 
    Jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note in favor of Bridger in original principal amount of   $49.5 million   (the "Jamex Secured Promissory Note") in satisfaction of all obligations owed to Bridger under the Jamex TLA; 
              (2) 
    Mr. Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee, executed and delivered a joint guarantee of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note obligations up to a maximum aggregate amount of   $20.0 million  ; 
              (3) 
    The operating partnership agreed to provide Jamex with a   $5.0 million   revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note (the  Jamex Revolving Promissory Note  and, together with the Jamex Secured Promissory Note, the  Jamex Notes  
              (4) 
    The other Jamex entities agreed to execute and deliver a security agreement and a full guarantee of the obligations under the Jamex Notes; 
     
   35 

     Table of Contents  

(5) 
    Ferrellgas Partners paid approximately   $16.9 million   to Jamex and in return received   0.9 million   of Ferrellgas Partners' common units, which were cancelled upon receipt, and approximately   23 thousand   barrels of crude oil; 
              (6) 
    The parties agreed to terminate the Jamex TLA and certain other commercial agreements and arrangements between them, and release any claims between or among them that may exist (other than those arising under the Jamex Termination Agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the Jamex Termination Agreement); and  
              (7) 
    Ferrellgas Partners waived the remaining lockup provision applicable to Jamex under the Registration Rights Agreement dated June 24, 2015 to which Jamex is party.  
       
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note originally had an annual interest rate of   7%   (which rate would be reduced under certain circumstances including if Ferrellgas Partners' quarterly distributions are less than   $0.25   per common unit; accordingly, as a result of the distribution declared on November 22, 2016, the interest rate will decrease to   2.8%  ), and contemplates quarterly amortizing principal payments, together with payments of accrued interest. The first payment, due December 17, 2016, will be an interest-only payment. The maturity date of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note will be December 17, 2021. Jamex will be allowed to prepay the Secured Promissory Note in whole or in part at any time. 
    
  The Jamex Revolving Promissory Note, which provides Jamex with access to working capital liquidity to meet their unrelated and ongoing crude oil marketing and other business needs, has an annual interest rate of   0%   (which rate would be increased in case of a default), and contains certain conditions precedent to the operating partnership s obligation to make any advances thereunder. Each borrowing under the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note must be repaid within   10   days, and the ultimate maturity date of the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note is the earlier of September 1, 2021 and the date on which all obligations under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note are repaid. 
    
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note is guaranteed, pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, jointly by James Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee (up to a maximum aggregate amount of   $20.0 million  ), and each Note is fully guaranteed, pursuant to respective Guaranty Agreements, by the other Jamex entities. The obligations of Jamex and the other Jamex entities under the Notes are secured, pursuant to a Security Agreement, by a lien on certain of those entities  assets, including common units, actively traded marketable securities and cash, which are held in a controlled account that can be seized by Ferrellgas, L.P. in the event of default. 
    
  During the year ended July 31, 2016, approximately   60%   of Midstream Operations - Crude oil logistics' segment (Bridger) gross margin was generated from its largest customer and Jamex, that customer's supplier, under take-or-pay arrangements. Bridger s largest customer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 owned a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania. Bridger was party to an agreement with this customer under which Bridger provided logistics services to transport crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota to the Trainer refinery. That agreement had a minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery for logistics services associated with the delivery of   65   MBbls/d. However, if the quantity of crude oil delivered to the refinery dropped below   35   MBbls/d, the minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery would be suspended and Jamex would become responsible for payments to Bridger under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During February 2016, Jamex ceased sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery and since that time Bridger had been billing Jamex directly in accordance with the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During July 2016, Ferrellgas, L.P. determined Jamex would not resume sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery or be likely to continue to make payments under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. As a result, we negotiated a settlement with Jamex, and the Jamex TLA was terminated on September 1, 2016. While the agreement with the refinery owner was not terminated as a result of the execution and delivery of the Jamex Termination Agreement, Bridger has been unable to negotiate a revised transportation and logistics agreement with that customer; accordingly it is unlikely that Bridger will continue to make any deliveries under the existing agreement. Consequently, we do not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or gross margin from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future.

E.      Accounts and notes receivable, net and accounts receivable securitization 
    
  Accounts and notes receivable, net consist of the following: 

On September 27, 2016, Ferrellgas, L.P. entered into a fourth amendment to its accounts receivable securitization facility to modify the maximum leverage ratio covenant as follows: 

The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in Ferrellgas, L.P.'s secured credit facility. Ferrellgas, L.P.'s leverage ratio was   5.81  x as of October 31, 2016.  
    
  At   October 31, 2016  ,   $105.3   million of trade accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against   $74.0   million of collateralized notes payable due to a commercial paper conduit. At   July 31, 2016  ,   $106.5 million   of trade accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against   $64.0 million   of collateralized notes payable due to the commercial paper conduit. These accounts receivable pledged as collateral are bankruptcy remote from Ferrellgas, L.P. Ferrellgas, L.P. does not provide any guarantee or similar support to the collectability of these accounts receivable pledged as collateral.  
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had received cash proceeds of   $74.0   million from trade accounts receivables securitized, with   no   remaining capacity to receive additional proceeds. As of   July 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had received cash proceeds of   $64.0   million from trade accounts receivables securitized, with   no   remaining capacity to receive additional proceeds. Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility had a weighted average interest rate of   2.7%   and   3.0%   as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , respectively.

Table of Contents  

F.      Debt 
    
  Short-term borrowings 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. classified a portion of its secured credit facility borrowings as short-term because it was used to fund working capital needs that management had intended to pay down within the 12 month period following each balance sheet date.  As of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  ,   $96.8 million   and   $101.3 million  , respectively, were classified as short-term borrowings. For further discussion see the secured credit facility section below. 
    
  Secured credit facility 
    
  On September 27, 2016, Ferrellgas, L.P. entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility to modify the maximum leverage ratio covenant as follows: 

The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in Ferrellgas, L.P.'s secured credit facility. Ferrellgas, L.P.'s leverage ratio was   5.81  x as of   October 31, 2016  , which equates to headroom of   $78.9 million   or   4.0%  . Because of this leverage ratio requirement Ferrellgas, L.P. continues to execute on a strategy to reduce its debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to its leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in Ferrellgas Partners' annual distribution, which was reduced during the quarter ended October 31, 2016 from an annualized rate of   $2.05   to   $0.40   per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until Ferrellgas, L.P.'s leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that Ferrellgas, L.P. deems appropriate for its business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, Ferrellgas, L.P. believes it is possible its leverage ratio will exceed   5.95  x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had total borrowings outstanding under its secured credit facility of   $415.0 million  , of which   $318.2 million   was classified as long-term debt. Ferrellgas, L.P. had   $173.6 million   of capacity under our secured credit facility as of   October 31, 2016  . However, the leverage ratio covenant under this facility limits additional borrowings to   $78.9 million   as of   October 31, 2016  . As of   July 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had total borrowings outstanding under its secured credit facility of   $394.4 million  , of which   $293.1 million   was classified as long-term debt. Ferrellgas, L.P. had   $219.3 million   of capacity under our secured credit facility as of   July 31, 2016  . However, the leverage ratio covenant under this facility limited additional borrowings to   $8.1 million   as of   July 31, 2016  . Borrowings outstanding at   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016   under the secured credit facility had weighted average interest rates of   4.1%   and   3.7%  , respectively.  
    
  The obligations under this credit facility are secured by substantially all assets of Ferrellgas, L.P., the general partner and certain subsidiaries of Ferrellgas, L.P. but specifically excluding (a) assets that are subject to Ferrellgas, L.P. s accounts receivable securitization facility, (b) the general partner s equity interests in Ferrellgas Partners and (c) equity interest in certain unrestricted subsidiaries. Such obligations are also guaranteed by the general partner and certain subsidiaries of Ferrellgas, L.P. 
    
  Letters of credit outstanding at   October 31, 2016   totaled   $111.4 million   and were used primarily to secure insurance arrangements and to a lesser extent, product purchases. Letters of credit outstanding at   July 31, 2016   totaled   $86.3 million   and were used primarily to secure insurance arrangements and, to a lesser extent, product purchases. At   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had remaining letter of credit capacity of   $88.6 million  . At   July 31, 2016   Ferrellgas, L.P. had remaining letter of credit capacity of   $113.7 million  .

H.      Fair value measurements 
    
  Derivative financial instruments 
    
  The following table presents Ferrellgas, L.P. s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, including both current and noncurrent portions, as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  : 

Methodology  
    
  The fair values of Ferrellgas, L.P. s non-exchange traded commodity derivative contracts are based upon indicative price quotations available through brokers, industry price publications or recent market transactions and related market indicators. The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are based upon third-party quotes or indicative values based on recent market transactions. 
    
  Other financial instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Jamex note receivable, a financial instrument classified in "Other assets, net" on the consolidated balance sheet, approximates fair value due to the market interest rate. At   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , the estimated fair value of Ferrellgas, L.P. s long-term debt instruments was   $1,803.4 million   and   $1,736.2 million  , respectively. Ferrellgas estimates the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our consolidated debt obligations is a Level 2 valuation based on the observable inputs used for similar liabilities. 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. has other financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable which could expose it to concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk from trade accounts receivable is limited because of a large customer base which extends across many different U.S. markets. 

I.     Derivative instruments and hedging activities 

41 

     Table of Contents  

Ferrellgas, L.P. is exposed to certain market risks related to its ongoing business operations. These risks include exposure to changing commodity prices as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Ferrellgas, L.P. utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Of these, the propane commodity derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. All other commodity derivative instruments do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow hedges, therefore, the change in their fair value are recorded currently in earnings. Ferrellgas, L.P. also periodically utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 
    
  Derivative instruments and hedging activities     
    
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   and 2015, Ferrellgas, L.P. did   no  t recognize any gain or loss in earnings related to hedge ineffectiveness and did not exclude any component of financial derivative contract gains or losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to commodity cash flow hedges.

The changes in derivatives included in AOCI for the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:  

Ferrellgas, L.P. expects to reclassify net losses related to the risk management commodity derivatives of approximately   $1.4 million   to earnings during the next 12 months. These net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments Ferrellgas, L.P. has with its customers that qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception. 
    
  During the   three months ended     October 31, 2016   and   2015  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had no reclassifications to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of any cash flow hedges arising from the probability of the original forecasted transactions not occurring within the originally specified period of time defined within the hedging relationship. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had financial derivative contracts covering   2.4 million   barrels of propane that were entered into as cash flow hedges of forward and forecasted purchases of propane. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. had financial derivative contracts covering   0.1 million   barrels of diesel and   21 thousand   barrels of unleaded gasoline related to fuel hedges in transportation of propane. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas, L.P. financial derivative contracts covering   0.2 million   barrels of crude oil related to the hedging of crude oil line fill and inventory. 
    
  Derivative financial instruments credit risk 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments. Ferrellgas, L.P. s counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major U.S. financial institutions. Ferrellgas, L.P. maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that it believes reduces its overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring its counterparties  financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits. Certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by Ferrellgas, L.P. in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. Ferrellgas, L.P. has concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments held by certain derivative financial instrument counterparties. If these counterparties that make up the concentration failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts at   October 31, 2016  , the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative financial instruments, Ferrellgas, L.P. would incur is $  2.7   million.    
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. holds certain derivative contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features which dictate credit limits based upon Ferrellgas, L.P. s debt rating. As of   October 31, 2016  , a downgrade in Ferrellgas, L.P.'s debt rating could trigger a reduction in credit limit and would result in an additional collateral requirement of   zero  . There were   no   derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position on   October 31, 2016   and Ferrellgas, L.P. had posted   no   collateral in the normal course of business related to such derivatives.  

J.      Transactions with related parties    
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. has   no   employees and is managed and controlled by its general partner. Pursuant to Ferrellgas, L.P. s partnership agreement, the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of Ferrellgas, L.P. and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to Ferrellgas, L.P. or otherwise reasonably incurred by its general partner in connection with operating Ferrellgas, L.P. s business. These costs primarily include compensation and benefits paid to employees of the general partner who perform services on Ferrellgas, L.P. s behalf and are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as follows:

K.        Contingencies and commitments 
    
  Litigation 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. s operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers of combustible liquids such as propane and crude oil. As a result, at any given time, Ferrellgas, L.P. can be threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as discussed below, Ferrellgas, L.P. is not a party to any legal proceedings other than various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters; however, management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Ferrellgas, L.P. 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. has been named as a defendant, along with a competitor, in putative class action lawsuits filed in multiple jurisdictions. The lawsuits allege that Ferrellgas, L.P. and a competitor coordinated in 2008 to reduce the fill level in barbeque cylinders and combined to persuade a common customer to accept that fill reduction, resulting in increased cylinder costs to direct customers and end-user customers in violation of federal and certain state antitrust laws. The lawsuits seek treble damages, attorneys  fees, injunctive relief and costs on behalf of the putative class. These lawsuits have been consolidated into one case by a multidistrict litigation panel.  The Court has dismissed all claims brought by direct and indirect customers other than state law claims of indirect customers under Wisconsin, Maine and Vermont law.  The direct customer plaintiffs have filed an appeal, which is pending. Ferrellgas, L.P. believes it has strong defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously defend against the consolidated case. Ferrellgas, L.P. does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  In addition, putative class action cases have been filed in California relating to residual propane remaining in the tank after use.  Ferrellgas, L.P. has prevailed at the trial court on a motion to dismiss those claims.  It is uncertain whether plaintiffs will appeal; Ferrellgas, L.P. intends to vigorously defend any such appeal.  Ferrellgas, L.P. does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  Ferrellgas, L.P. has been named, along with several current and former officers, in several class action lawsuits alleging violations of certain securities laws based on alleged materially false and misleading statements in certain of our public disclosures.  The lawsuits, the first of which was filed on October 6, 2016 in the Southern District of New York, seek unspecified compensatory damages.  A derivative lawsuit with similar allegations has been filed in state court in Missouri naming Ferrellgas, L.P. and several current and former officers and directors as defendants.  Ferrellgas, L.P. believes that it has defenses and will vigorously defend these cases.  Ferrellgas, L.P. does not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuits or the derivative action. 
    
  On October 21, 2016, Julio E. Rios II, an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC, and Jeremy H. Gamboa, also an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the Chief Operating Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC both delivered notice of "good reason" for resignation to the general partner pursuant to their employment agreements alleging that the general partner had materially diminished their responsibilities and stating their intention to resign as a result if such purported material diminution is not cured within 30 days.  
    
  On November 28, 2016, Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa each resigned from their positions, purportedly for "good reason" pursuant to their employment agreements.  Each has indicated that they intend to make a claim for severance.  The general partner denies that Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa had "good reason" to resign and has other defenses to their claims for severance.  Ferrellgas, L.P. does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to this matter.

  The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  The discussions set forth in the  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there exist two material differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Those material differences are: 

because Ferrellgas Partners has outstanding   $182.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   8.625%   senior notes due fiscal 2020, the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness; see the statements of operations in their respective condensed consolidated financial statements; and

Recent developments 
  Termination of Bridger agreement with Jamex 
    
  In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Bridger in June 2015, Bridger entered into a ten-year transportation and logistics agreement (the  Jamex TLA ) with Jamex pursuant to which Jamex would be responsible for certain payments to Bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for Bridger s largest customer. 
    
  As a result of concerns regarding the collectability of amounts owed to Bridger from Jamex under the Jamex TLA and certain other matters between Bridger and Jamex, Bridger, Jamex, Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the Jamex TLA, facilitated Ferrellgas purchasing certain Ferrellgas common units from Jamex, and established payment terms for certain amounts owed by Jamex to Bridger under the Jamex TLA. Consequently, Ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's largest customer in the future. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, Bridger and Ferrellgas entered into a Termination, Settlement and Release Agreement (the  Jamex Termination Agreement ) with Jamex, certain of Jamex's affiliates, and James Ballengee (the owner of Jamex) pursuant to which: 
    
           (1) 
    Jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note in favor of Bridger in original principal amount of $49.5 million (the "Jamex Secured Promissory Note") in satisfaction of all obligations owed to Bridger under the Jamex TLA; 
              (2) 
    Mr. Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee, executed and delivered a joint guarantee of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note obligations up to a maximum aggregate amount of $20.0 million; 
              (3) 
    The operating partnership agreed to provide Jamex with a $5.0 million revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note (the  Jamex Revolving Promissory Note  and, together with the Jamex Secured Promissory Note, the  Jamex Notes  
              (4) 
    The other Jamex entities agreed to execute and deliver a security agreement and a full guarantee of the obligations under the Jamex Notes; 
              (5) 
    Ferrellgas paid approximately $16.9 million to Jamex and in return received (and cancelled) 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units; 
              (6) 
    The parties agreed to terminate the Jamex TLA and certain other commercial agreements and arrangements between them, and release any claims between or among them that may exist (other than those arising under the Jamex Termination Agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the Jamex Termination Agreement); and  
              (7) 
    Ferrellgas waived the remaining lockup provision applicable to Jamex under the Registration Rights Agreement dated June 24, 2015 to which Jamex is party.  
       
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note originally had an annual interest rate of 7% (which rate would be reduced under certain circumstances, including if Ferrellgas Partners' quarterly distributions are less than $0.25 per common unit; accordingly, as a result of the distribution declared on November 22, 2016, the interest rate will decrease to 2.8%), and contemplates quarterly amortizing principal payments, together with payments of accrued interest. The first payment, due December 17, 2016, will be an interest-only payment. The maturity date of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note will be December 17, 2021. Jamex will be allowed to prepay the Secured Promissory Note in whole or in part at any time. 
    
  The Jamex Revolving Promissory Note, which provides Jamex with access to working capital liquidity to meet their unrelated and ongoing crude oil marketing and other business needs, has an annual interest rate of 0% (which rate would be increased in case of a default), and contains certain conditions precedent to the operating partnership s obligation to make any advances thereunder. Each borrowing under the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note must be repaid within 10 days, and the ultimate maturity date of the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note is the earlier of September 1, 2021 and the date on which all obligations under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note are repaid. 
    
  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note is guaranteed, pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, jointly by James Ballengee and Bacchus (up to a maximum aggregate amount of $20.0 million), and each Note is fully guaranteed, pursuant to respective Guaranty Agreements, by the other Jamex entities. The obligations of Jamex and the other Jamex entities under the Notes are secured, pursuant to a Security Agreement, by a lien on certain of those entities  assets, including common units, actively traded marketable securities and cash, which are held in a controlled account that can be seized by us in the event of default. 
    
  During the year ended July 31, 2016, approximately 60% and 80% of Midstream Operations - Crude oil logistics' segment (Bridger) gross margin and EBITDA, respectively, was generated from its largest customer and Jamex, that customer's supplier,  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  

under take-or-pay arrangements. Bridger s largest customer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 owned a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania. Bridger was party to an agreement with this customer under which Bridger provided logistics services to transport crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota to the Trainer refinery. That agreement had a minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery for logistics services associated with the delivery of 65 MBbls/d. However, if the quantity of crude oil delivered to the refinery dropped below 35 MBbls/d, the minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery would be suspended and Jamex would become responsible for payments to Bridger under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During February 2016, Jamex ceased sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery and since that time Bridger had been billing Jamex directly in accordance with the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During July 2016, we determined Jamex would not resume sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery or be likely to continue to make payments under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. As a result, we negotiated a settlement with Jamex, and the Jamex TLA was terminated on September 1, 2016. While the agreement with the refinery owner was not terminated as a result of the execution and delivery of the Jamex Termination Agreement, Bridger has been unable to negotiate a revised transportation and logistics agreement with that customer; accordingly it is unlikely that Bridger will continue to make any deliveries under the existing agreement. Consequently, Ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's largest customer in the future. Additionally, the continued, sustained decline in crude oil prices and resulting decrease in crude oil production in the regions in which we operate continued to significantly impact our trucking and rail operations during the three months ended October 31, 2016, a trend we anticipate will continue in fiscal 2017 and beyond.  
    
  Secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility amendments 
    
  Our leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility. During fiscal 2016 our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 5.5x. Our leverage ratio was 5.48x as of July 31, 2016, which equated to headroom of $8.1 million or 0.3%, primarily because of the combination of (1) a $44.8 million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from Jamex at July 31, 2016; (2) the $45.9 million purchase of 2.4 million common units from Jamex in November 2015; (3) a $16.9 million repurchase of 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units from Jamex on September 1, 2016; (4) Midstream operations - crude oil logistics (Bridger) growth capital expenditures of approximately $52.4 million; (5) the warm weather in fiscal 2016 which was 19% warmer than normal and 16% warmer than fiscal 2015, which led to reduced demand for propane; and (6) the decline in our water solutions business. As a result of these factors, and the Jamex settlement discussed above, on September 27, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which our leverage ratio covenant was modified, as follows: 

As of October 31, 2016 our leverage ratio was 5.81x which equates to headroom of $78.9 million or 4.0%. Because of this leverage ratio requirement we continue to execute on a strategy to reduce our debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annual distribution, which was reduced during our quarter ended October 31, 2016 from an annualized rate of $2.05 to $0.40 per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until our leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that we deem appropriate for our business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, we believe it is possible our leverage ratio will exceed 5.95x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017.  
    
  Distributions 
    
  On November 22, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner announced a quarterly distribution of $0.10, payable on December 15, 2016, to all unitholders of record as of December 8, 2016, which equates to an annual distribution rate of $0.40, or $1.65 lower than our previous annual distribution rate of $2.05. This decrease in distributions will provide  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

approximately $160 million of internally generated capital on an annualized basis to provide increased liquidity, reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
    
  How We Evaluate Our Operations 
    
  We evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures, because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives. 
    
  Segment disclosure 
    
     Propane and related equipment sales 
    
  We are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the United States as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal   2016   and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all   50   states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States.  
    
  We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. We use the definition of  normal  temperatures based on information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage. 
    
  Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the  winter heating season ). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability. Weather in the more highly concentrated geographic areas we serve for the three months ended October 31, 2016 was approximately 35% warmer than normal. Because this significantly warmer than normal weather was only 6% warmer than prior year quarter, our propane and related equipment sales results were consistent with those of the prior year quarter. However, if this winter weather pattern continues, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources for the remainder of fiscal 2017. 
         
  We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short-term basis. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. 
    
  Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal   2017   and   2018   sales commitments and, as of   October 31, 2016  , have experienced net mark to market gains of approximately   $2.0 million  . Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as  Prepaid expenses and other current assets,  "Other assets, net,"  Other current liabilities,  "Other liabilities" and  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),  respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to  Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative propane purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by decreased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At   October 31, 2016  , we estimate   55%   of currently open financial derivative propane purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months. 
  Midstream Operations -   Crude oil logistics 
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

Our crude oil logistics segment ("Bridger") primarily generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil. Bridger services include transportation through its operation of a fleet of trucks, tank trailers, railcars, pipeline injection terminals, and a barge. We primarily operate in major oil and gas basins across the continental United States. Our crude oil logistics segment also enters into crude oil purchase and sales arrangements. We manage our exposure to price fluctuations by using back-to-back contracts and financial hedging positions. 
    
  During the year ended July 31, 2016, approximately 60% and 80% of Midstream Operations - Crude oil logistics' segment (Bridger) gross margin and EBITDA, respectively, was generated from its largest customer and Jamex. However, due to the September 1, 2016 termination of the Jamex TLA we do not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's largest customer in the future. Additionally, the continued, sustained decline in crude oil prices and resulting decrease in crude oil production in the regions in which we operate continued to significantly impact our trucking and rail operations during the three months ended October 31, 2016, a trend we anticipate will continue in fiscal 2017 and beyond. 

Summary Discussion of Results of Operations: 
    
  For the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015    
    
  During the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , we generated a net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners L.P. of $  43.1 million  , compared to $  79.8 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . 
    
  Our propane and related products segment generated operating income of   $16.5 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to   $13.7 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . Due to the seasonal nature of demand for propane, sales volumes of our propane and related products segment typically are higher during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year than during the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. The primary reason for the increase in operating income during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   compared to the   three months ended October 31, 2015   was decreased operating expense related to vehicle fuel costs.  
    
  Our crude oil logistics segment generated operating income of $1.0 million during the   three months ended October 31, 2016    compared to $2.3 million of operating loss during the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we committed to a plan to sell certain trucks, resulting in an increase of $13.4 million in "Loss on disposal of assets and other" that was not repeated in the current fiscal quarter. This favorable item was substantially offset by the impact of the termination of the Jamex TLA and decline in trucking and rail operations, as discussed above. 
    
  Corporate and other, including our water solutions operations, recognized an operating loss of   $27.3 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to an operating loss of   $58.9 million   recognized during the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . The prior year results from our water solutions operations include a $29.3 million asset impairment charge that was not repeated in the current fiscal quarter. 
    
   Interest expense  for both Ferrellgas and the operating partnership increased   $1.6 million   primarily due to the incurrence of new debt incurred to fund $52.4 million of Bridger growth capital expenditures and the repurchase of $62.8 million of common units from Jamex each as discussed above.  
    
  Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors decreased from   $11.2 million   in the prior period to   $(6.2) million   in the current period primarily due to a   $20.0 million   decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from our Crude oil logistics segment resulting from the termination of the Jamex TLA and decline in trucking operations, as discussed above. 
    
  Distributable cash flow shortage increased from   $40.5 million   in the prior period to   $55.9 million   in the current period, primarily due to a   $20.0 million   decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from our Crude oil logistics segment, as discussed above, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in maintenance capital expenditures.

Consolidated Results of Operations 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
       
  In this Quarterly Report we present three primary non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, and Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA  . Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., less the sum of the following: income tax benefit, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge, non-cash stock-based compensation charge, asset impairments, loss on asset sales and disposal, other income (expense), net, change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance costs, unrealized (non-cash) losses on changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, acquisition and transition expenses and net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest. Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership's performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes makes it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Equity Investors  . Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest, maintenance capital expenditures, cash paid for taxes, and proceeds from asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have  associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Common Unitholders  . Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributable cash flow attributable to general  
  
   65 

     Table of Contents  

partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to common unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  The following table summarizes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors and Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders for the three months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

(a) 
    Net cash interest expense is the sum of interest expense less non-cash interest expense and other income (expense), net.  This amount includes interest expense related to the accounts receivable securitization facility. 
              (b)  
    Maintenance capital expenditures include capitalized expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment.

  Items Impacting the Comparability of Our Financial Results 
    
  Our current and future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented due to the termination of the Jamex TLA, a significant contract for our Midstream operations - crude oil logistics segment.

Propane and related equipment sales 
    
  The following table summarizes propane sales volumes and the Adjusted EBITDA results of our propane and related equipment sales segment for the periods indicated: 

NM - Not meaningful 
  (a) Gross margin for Other Gas Sales is allocated to Gross margin "Retail - Sales to End Users" and "Wholesale - Sales to Resellers" based on the volumes in each respective category. 
  (b) Other primarily includes appliance and material sales, and to a lesser extent various customer fee income.  
  (c) Gross margin from "Propane and other gas liquids sales" represents "Revenues - Propane and other gas liquids sales" less "Cost of sales - Propane and other gas liquids sales" and does not include depreciation and amortization. 
    
  Propane sales volumes during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   increased   1%   or   1.6 million   gallons, from that of the prior year period primarily due to   1.4 million   of increased gallon sales to wholesale customers.  
    
    Our wholesale sales price per gallon correlates to the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   averaged 19% and 18% more than the prior year period, respectively. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged $0.51 and

     Table of Contents  

$0.43 per gallon during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged $0.46 and $0.39 per gallon during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Revenues  
    
  Retail and wholesale sales experienced virtually no change compared to the prior year period. The first fiscal quarter generally has fewer heat sensitive gallons sold and propane prices from a cents per gallon perspective did not change significantly enough to affect overall revenues. 
    
  Other gas sales decreased   $2.7 million   compared to the prior year period primarily due to   $3.8 million   resulting from decreased sales volumes, partially offset by a   $1.1 million   increase in sales price per gallon. 
    
  Other revenues decreased   $3.1 million   compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decrease in the sales of certain lower margin equipment. 
    
  Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales 
    
  Gross margin remained consistent with the prior year period as it only decreased   $0.4 million  .  
    
  Gross margin - Other 
    
  Gross margin decreased $0.4 million primarily due to a decrease in the sale of certain lower margin equipment. 
    
  Operating income 
    
  Operating income increased $2.8 million primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease in "Operating, general and administrative expense", primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in vehicle fuel costs. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA decreased $  1.1 million   primarily due to a   $0.4 million   decrease in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales", and a $0.4 decrease in "Gross margin - Other".

Midstream operations - Crude oil logistics 
    
  The following table summarizes the volume of product sold and hauled, as well as Adjusted EBITDA results of our crude oil logistics segment for the periods indicated: 

NM - Not meaningful 
  (a) Gross margin represents "Revenues - Midstream operations" less "Cost of sales - Midstream operations" and does not include depreciation and amortization. 
  (b) Operating, general, and administrative expenses are included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. General and administrative expenses include only certain items that were directly attributable to the crude oil logistics segment. 
    
  Crude oil hauled during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   decreased 54% or 13.0 million barrels, from that of the prior period primarily due to the termination of the Jamex TLA as discussed above. 
    
  Revenues 
    
  Crude oil logistics revenues decreased 82% or $100.1 million compared to the prior period, primarily due to the termination of the Jamex TLA as discussed above. The increase in crude oil sales reflects an $11.4 million increase related to the volume of crude oil sold and to a $5.6 million increase related to the change in the market price of crude oil.     
    
  Gross margin 
    
  Crude oil logistics gross margin decreased 80% or $29.3 million compared to the prior period, primarily due to the termination of the Jamex TLA as discussed above, which was partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in gross margin related to crude oil sales. This crude oil sales gross margin increase primarily related to improved margins and to a lesser extent increased volumes. 
    
  Operating income (loss) 
    
  We recorded operating income of $1.0 million during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   as compared to an operating loss of $2.3 million for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . Operating income increased due to a $13.4 million "Loss on asset sales and disposal" recognized in the prior year that was not repeated in the current fiscal quarter. Additionally, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.3 million due to the impact of the asset impairment charge recognized  
  
   69 

     Table of Contents  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Also operating, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.0 million primarily due to decreases in personnel, plant and office and bad debt expenses. These favorable effects to operating income were partially offset by a $26.5 million decrease in gross margin which resulted primarily from the termination of the Jamex TLA as discussed above. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA decreased   $20.0 million   primarily due to the $26.2 million decrease in Gross margin, partially offset by the   $6.1 million   decrease in operating, general and administrative expenses, both as discussed above. 
  Corporate   other 
    
  The following table summarizes the financial results of our corporate and other operations, which includes our Water solutions operations for the periods indicated: 

NM- Not Meaningful 
  (a) Gross margin represents "Revenues - Midstream operations" less "Cost of sales - Midstream operations" and does not include depreciation and amortization. 
    
  Operating loss 
    
  Corporate and other, including our water solutions operations, recognized an operating loss of $27.3 million   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to an operating loss of $58.9 million recognized during the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . Prior year results from our water solutions operations include an impairment charge of $29.3 million related to the write down of goodwill that was not repeated in the current period.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  The Adjusted EBITDA within "corporate and other" increased by   $0.6 million   primarily due to a decrease of $0.4 million general and administrative personnel and other expenses.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

70 

     Table of Contents  

General 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow from operating activities, borrowings under our secured credit facility or accounts receivable securitization facility and funds received from sales of debt and equity securities. These liquidity and capital resources enable us to fund our working capital requirements, letter of credit requirements, debt service payments, acquisition and capital expenditures and distributions to our unitholders. Our liquidity and capital resources may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, covenants in our debt agreements, unforeseen demands on cash, or other events beyond our control. 
    
  Our leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility. During fiscal 2016 our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 5.5x. Our leverage ratio was 5.48x as of July 31, 2016, which equated to headroom of $8.1 million or 0.3%, primarily because of the combination of (1) a $44.8 million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from Jamex at July 31, 2016; (2) the $45.9 million purchase of 2.4 million common units from Jamex in November 2015; (3) a $16.9 million repurchase of 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units from Jamex on September 1, 2016; (4) Midstream operations - crude oil logistics (Bridger) growth capital expenditures of approximately $52.4 million; (5) the warm weather in fiscal 2016 which was 19% warmer than normal and 16% warmer than fiscal 2015, which led to reduced demand for propane; and (6) the decline in our water solutions business. As a result of these factors, and the Jamex settlement discussed above, on September 27, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which our leverage ratio covenant was modified, as follows: 

As of October 31, 2016 our leverage ratio was 5.81x which equates to headroom of $78.9 million or 4.0%. Because of this leverage ratio requirement we continue to execute on a strategy to reduce our debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annual distribution, which was reduced during our quarter ended October 31, 2016 from an annualized rate of $2.05 to $0.40 per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until our leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that we deem appropriate for our business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, we believe it is possible our leverage ratio will exceed 5.95x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017.  
    
  As described in financing activities below, on November 22, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner announced a quarterly distribution of $0.10, payable on December 15, 2016, to all unitholders of record as of December 8, 2016, which equates to an annual distribution rate of $0.40, or $1.65 lower than our previous annual distribution rate of $2.05. This decrease in distributions will provide approximately $160 million of internally generated capital on an annualized basis to provide increased liquidity, reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
    
  Distributable Cash Flow 
    
  A reconciliation of distributable cash flow to distributions paid for the twelve months ended   October 31, 2016   to the twelve months ended   July 31, 2016   is as follows (in thousands): 

71 

     Table of Contents  

For the twelve months ended   October 31, 2016  , distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors decreased   $17.4 million   compared to the twelve months ended   July 31, 2016  . Cash distributions paid to equity investors decreased   $1.7 million   primarily due to reductions in common units outstanding, which resulted from a November 2015 repurchase and cancellation of 2.4 million common units and a September 2016 repurchase and cancellation of 0.9 million common units. These changes resulted in a decrease in our distribution coverage ratio to   0.89   for the twelve months ended   October 31, 2016   as compared to   0.97   for the twelve months ended   July 31, 2016  . Cash reserves, which we utilize to meet future anticipated expenditures, decreased by   $22.1 million   during the twelve months ended   October 31, 2016   compared to a decrease of   $6.4 million   in the twelve months ended   July 31, 2016  . We expect the reduction in our quarterly distributions, discussed above, will reduce our cash deficiencies in the future. 
       
  We believe that the liquidity available from our cash flow from operating activities, our secured credit facility and related amendment, the accounts receivable securitization facility and related amendment, combined with our other debt reduction initiatives, which may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annualized distribution will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements.  
    
  During periods of high volatility, our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund. Likewise our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us. 
    
  Our working capital requirements are subject to, among other things, the price of propane and crude oil, delays in the collection of receivables, volatility in energy commodity prices, liquidity imposed by insurance providers, downgrades in our credit ratings, decreased trade credit, significant acquisitions, the weather, customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane and crude oil. Relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements. 
    
  Our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business and weather conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business, a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season. Our midstream operations segment generally does not experience seasonality. Our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts. Historically, we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our propane and related equipment sales segment. 
    
  Our secured credit facility, publicly-held debt and accounts receivable securitization facility contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions. In general, these tests are based on our debt-to-cash flow ratio and cash flow-to-interest expense ratio. Our general partner currently believes that the most restrictive of these tests is the leverage ratio under the terms of our secured credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities, which is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in our secured credit facility. 
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , we met all of our required quarterly financial tests and covenants. Based upon current estimates of our cash flow, combined with other debt reduction initiatives which may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annualized distribution, our general partner believes  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  

that we will be able to continue to meet all of our required quarterly financial tests and covenants in fiscal   2017  . However, we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters if we were to experience: 

continued significantly warmer than normal temperatures during the winter heating season; 
                
    a more volatile energy commodity cost environment; 
                
    an unexpected downturn in business operations; 
                
    a significant delay in the collection of accounts or notes receivable; 
                
    a failure to execute our debt reduction initiatives; 
                
    a change in customer retention or purchasing patterns due to economic or other factors in the United States; or 
                
    a material downturn in the credit and/or equity markets. 
       
  Failure to meet applicable financial tests could have a material effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could further restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders, even if sufficient funds were available.  If we are unable to comply with any of the financial covenants, including the maximum leverage ratio, we will be required to negotiate a waiver or amendment to the covenant.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a waiver or amendment of covenant breaches if needed. 
    
  Our inability to comply with any of the covenants under our secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, in the absence of a waiver or amendment, will result in a default under both facilities.  A default under the facilities, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default that would permit the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under the facilities.  The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration under our other debt.  If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full and we may be unable to borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt, in which case our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. 
    
  Depending on the circumstances, we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders. No assurances can be given, however, that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter. 
    
  In order to reduce existing indebtedness, fund future acquisitions and expansive capital projects, we may obtain funds from our facilities, further reduce distributions, sell assets, issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing financing arrangements or issue additional common units. 
    
  Toward this purpose, the following registration statements were effective upon filing or declared effective by the SEC: 

a shelf registration statement for the periodic sale of common units for general business purposes, which, among other things, may include the following: repayment of outstanding indebtedness; the redemption of any senior notes or other securities (other than common units) previously issued; working capital; capital expenditures; acquisitions, or other general business purposes. As of October 31, 2016, Ferrellgas Partners had issued   6.3 million   common units from this shelf registration statement; and 
                
    an  acquisition  shelf registration statement for the periodic sale of up to $500.0 million in common units to fund acquisitions; as of October 31, 2016, Ferrellgas Partners had $500.0 million available under this shelf registration statement. 
       
  In addition, we monitor the trading market for our outstanding debt securities and we may from time to time repurchase outstanding senior notes, whether in open market transactions or privately negotiated repurchases. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $54.6 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $40.8 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a   $35.3 million   decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by a   $20.3 million   decrease in cash flow from operations. 
    
  The decrease in working capital requirements for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   compared to the   three months ended October 31, 2015   was primarily due to a   $27.2 million   decrease in requirements for accounts payable largely due to a decline in accounts payable during the three months ended October 31, 2015 as a result of decreased volumes in Midstream

     Table of Contents  

operations pipeline movements and decreases in the wholesale price of propane, and a $24.7 million decrease in requirements for other current liabilities resulting primarily from timing of payments made to employees and an increase in deferred revenues as a result of an increase in customers pre-buying propane for the winter. These decreases in working capital requirements were partially offset by a   $8.2 million   increase in requirements for accounts receivable related primarily to a decrease in billings in our Midstream operations as a result of decreased volumes and a   $10.4 million   increase in requirements for inventory, primarily due to increases in propane gas and related products inventory during the three months ended October 31, 2016. 
    
  The decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a $27.4 million decrease in gross margin, as discussed above by segment, a $1.6 million increase in "Interest expense", as discussed above, partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in "Operating expense", as discussed above by segment, exclusive of the effects of fluctuations in non-cash stock-based compensation. 
    
  The operating partnership 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $54.6 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $42.6 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a   $33.5 million   decrease in working capital requirements, partially offset by a   $20.3 million   decrease in cash flow from operations. 
    
  The decrease in working capital requirements for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   compared to the   three months ended October 31, 2015   was primarily due to a   $27.2 million   decrease in requirements for accounts payable largely due to a decline in accounts payable during the three months ended October 31, 2015 as a result of decreased volumes in Midstream operations pipeline movements and decreases in the wholesale price of propane, and a $22.8 million decrease in requirements for other current liabilities resulting primarily from timing of payments made to employees and an increase in deferred revenues as a result of an increase in customers pre-buying propane for the winter. These decreases in working capital requirements were partially offset by a   $7.9 million   increase in requirements for accounts receivable related primarily to a decrease in billings in our Midstream operations as a result of decreased volumes and a   $10.4 million   increase in requirements for inventory, primarily due to increases in propane gas and related products inventory during the three months ended October 31, 2016. 
    
  The decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a $27.4 million decrease in gross margin, as discussed above by segment, a $1.6 million increase in "Interest expense", partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in "Operating expense", exclusive of the effects of fluctuations in non-cash stock-based compensation. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners 
    
  Capital Requirements 
    
  Our business requires continual investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for our business consist primarily of:  

Maintenance capital expenditures. These capital expenditures include expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures include a routine replacement of a worn-out asset or replacement of major vehicle components; and 

Growth capital expenditures. These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples include expenditures for purchases of both bulk and portable propane tanks and other equipment to facilitate expansion of our customer base and operating capacity. 
       
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $7.7 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $22.0 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . This decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a   $15.6 million   decrease in "Capital expenditures", partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in "Proceeds from sale of assets".  

74 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in "Capital expenditures" is a result of our efforts to tightly control costs during this period of high leverage and includes reductions in all areas, including a   $7.3 million   decrease in Propane and related equipment sales, a $3.1 million decrease Midstream operations - crude oil logistics, and a $5.4 million decrease in Corporate and other.    
    
  Due to the mature nature of our Propane and related equipment sales operations segment, we do not anticipate significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures. However, future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects.   
    
  Due to the relatively new nature of our Midstream operations, we may experience significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures as our facilities age and future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $39.2 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $17.6 million   for the   three months ended October 31, 2015  . This increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to a $15.9 million repurchase of common units during the current quarter and a   $6.1 million   decrease in net credit facility and accounts receivable borrowings. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  Ferrellgas Partners paid a   $0.5125   per unit quarterly distribution on all common units, as well as the related general partner distributions, totaling   $50.3 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   in connection with the distributions declared for the three month period ended July 31, 2016. The quarterly distribution of   $0.10   on all common units and the related general partner distribution for the   three months ended October 31, 2016   totaling   $9.8 million   are expected to be paid on   December 15, 2016   to holders of record on   December 8, 2016  . 
        
  Secured credit facility 
    
  Our leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility. During fiscal 2016 our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 5.5x. Our leverage ratio was 5.48x as of July 31, 2016, which equated to headroom of $8.1 million or 0.3%, primarily because of the combination of (1) a $44.8 million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from Jamex at July 31, 2016; (2) the $45.9 million purchase of 2.4 million common units from Jamex in November 2015; (3) a $16.9 million repurchase of 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units from Jamex on September 1, 2016; (4) Midstream operations - crude oil logistics (Bridger) growth capital expenditures of approximately $52.4 million; (5) the warm weather in fiscal 2016 which was 19% warmer than normal and 16% warmer than fiscal 2015, which led to reduced demand for propane; and (6) the decline in our water solutions business. As a result of these factors, and the Jamex settlement discussed above, on September 27, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which our leverage ratio covenant was modified, as follows: 

As of October 31, 2016 our leverage ratio was 5.81x which equates to headroom of $78.9 million or 4.0%. Because of this  
  
   75 

     Table of Contents  

leverage ratio requirement we continue to execute on a strategy to reduce our debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annual distribution, which was reduced during our quarter ended October 31, 2016 from an annualized rate of $2.05 to $0.40 per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until our leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that we deem appropriate for our business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, we believe it is possible our leverage ratio will exceed 5.95x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017.  
    
  As of   October 31, 2016  , we had total borrowings outstanding under our secured credit facility of   $415.0 million  , of which   $318.2 million   was classified as long-term debt. Additionally, Ferrellgas had $173.6 million of capacity under our secured credit facility as of   October 31, 2016  . However, the leverage ratio covenant under this facility limits additional borrowings to $78.9 million as of   October 31, 2016  .  
    
  Borrowings outstanding at   October 31, 2016   under the secured credit facility had a weighted average interest rate of   4.1%  . All borrowings under the secured credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either: 

for Base Rate Loans or Swing Line Loans, the Base Rate, which is defined as the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America s prime rate; or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%; plus a margin varying from 0.75% to 2.50%; or 
                
    for Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Eurodollar Rate, which is defined as the LIBOR Rate plus a margin varying from 1.75% to 3.50%. 
       
  As of   October 31, 2016  , the federal funds rate and Bank of America s prime rate were 0.35% and 3.50%, respectively. As of   October 31, 2016  , the one-month and three-month LIBOR Rates were 0.53% and 0.89%, respectively. 
    
  In addition, an annual commitment fee is payable at a per annum rate ranging from 0.35% to 0.50% times the actual daily amount by which the secured credit facility exceeds the sum of (i) the outstanding amount of revolving credit loans and (ii) the outstanding amount of letter of credit obligations. 
    
  The obligations under this secured credit facility are secured by substantially all assets of the operating partnership, the general partner and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership but specifically excluding (a) assets that are subject to the operating partnership s accounts receivable securitization facility, (b) the general partner s equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners and (c) equity interest in certain unrestricted subsidiaries. Such obligations are also guaranteed by the general partner and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership. 
    
  Letters of credit outstanding at   October 31, 2016   totaled   $111.4 million   and were used primarily to secure insurance arrangements and, to a lesser extent, product purchases. At   October 31, 2016  , we had remaining letter of credit capacity of   $88.6 million  . 
    
  All standby letter of credit commitments under our secured credit facility bear a per annum rate varying from 1.75% to 3.50% (as of   October 31, 2016  , the rate was 3.00%) times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such letter of credit. Letter of credit fees are computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. 
    
  Accounts receivable securitization 
    
  Our leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing twelve month EBITDA of the operating partnership (adjusted for certain, defined items), as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility. During fiscal 2016 our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 5.5x. Our leverage ratio was 5.48x as of July 31, 2016, primarily because of the combination of (1) a $44.8 million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from Jamex at July 31, 2016; (2) the $45.9 million purchase of 2.4 million common units from Jamex in November 2015; (3) a $16.9 million repurchase of 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units from Jamex on September 1, 2016; (4) Midstream operations - crude oil logistics (Bridger) growth capital expenditures of approximately $52.4 million; (5) the warm weather in fiscal 2016 which was 19% warmer than normal and 16% warmer than fiscal 2015, which led to reduced demand for propane; and (6) the decline in our water solutions business. As a result of these factors, and the Jamex settlement discussed above, on September 27, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which our leverage ratio covenant was modified, as follows: 

76 

     Table of Contents  

As of October 31, 2016 our leverage ratio was 5.81x. Because of this leverage ratio requirement we continue to execute on a strategy to reduce our debt. This strategy may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annual distribution, which was reduced during our quarter ended October 31, 2016 from an annualized rate of $2.05 to $0.40 per common unit. We believe that any debt reducing actions taken would likely remain in effect until our leverage ratio reaches 4.5x or a level that we deem appropriate for our business. However, if weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful, we believe it is possible our leverage ratio will exceed 5.95x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2017.  
    
  Ferrellgas Receivables is a consolidated subsidiary. Expenses associated with accounts receivable securitization transactions are recorded in  Interest expense  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, borrowings and repayments associated with these transactions are recorded in  Cash flows from financing activities  in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  Cash flows from our accounts receivable securitization facility   increased     $12.0 million  . We received net funding of   $10.0 million   from this facility during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   as compared to net reductions in funding of   $2.0 million   from this facility during the three months ended October 31, 2015. 
    
  Our strategy is to maximize liquidity by utilizing the accounts receivable securitization facility along with borrowings under the secured credit facility. See additional discussion about the secured credit facility in  Financing Activities   Secured credit facility.  Our utilization of the accounts receivable securitization facility is limited by the amount of accounts receivable that we are permitted to securitize according to the facility agreement. As of   October 31, 2016  , we had received cash proceeds of   $74.0   million related to the securitization of our trade accounts receivable, with   no   remaining capacity to receive additional proceeds. As of   October 31, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate was   2.7%  . As our trade accounts receivable increase during the winter heating season, the securitization facility permits us to receive greater proceeds as eligible trade accounts receivable increases, thereby providing additional cash for working capital needs. 
    
  Common unit repurchase 
    
  On September 1, 2016, utilizing borrowings under our secured credit facility, Ferrellgas Partners paid approximately $16.9 million to Jamex and in return received 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units, which were cancelled upon receipt, and approximately 23 thousand barrels of crude oil. 
    
  We believe that the liquidity available from our cash flow from operating activities, our secured credit facility and related amendment, the accounts receivable securitization facility and related amendment, combined with our other debt reduction initiatives, which may include issuance of equity, issuance of debt not subject to our leverage ratio calculations, asset sales or a further reduction in our annualized distribution will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements. However, if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in these requirements, our needs could exceed our immediately available resources. Events that could cause increases in these requirements include, but are not limited to the following: 

a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane; 
                
    a significant reduction in the production of crude oil; 
                
    a significant delay in the collections of accounts or notes receivable; 
                
    increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities; 
                
    increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers; 
                
    a significant downgrade in our credit rating leading to decreased trade credit; or 
                
    a large uninsured unfavorable lawsuit settlement. 
     
   77 

     Table of Contents  

If one or more of these or other events caused a significant use of available funding, we may consider alternatives to provide increased liquidity and capital funding. No assurances can be given, however, that such alternatives would be available, or, if available, could be implemented. See a discussion of related risk factors in the section in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and under Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  The operating partnership 
    
  The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for the repurchase of common units discussed above, and cash flows related to distributions, as discussed below. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  The operating partnership paid cash distributions of   $66.7 million   and   $52.5 million   during the   three months ended October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The operating partnership expects to pay cash distributions of   $17.7 million   on   December 15, 2016  . 
    
  Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties 
    
  We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreements, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled $64.3 million for the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf as well as related general and administrative expenses. 
    
   Related party common unitholder information consisted of the following: 

(1)  Ferrell Companies is the owner of the general partner and is an approximate   23%   direct owner of Ferrellgas Partners' common units and thus a related party. Ferrell Companies also beneficially owns   195,686   and   51,204   common units of Ferrellgas Partners held by FCI Trading Corp. ("FCI Trading") and Ferrell Propane, Inc. ("Ferrell Propane"), respectively, bringing Ferrell Companies' beneficial ownership to   23.4%   at   October 31, 2016  . 
  (2)  FCI Trading is an affiliate of the general partner and thus a related party.  
  (3)  Ferrell Propane is controlled by the general partner and thus a related party.  
  (4)  James E. Ferrell is the Interim Chief Executive Officer and President of the general partner; and is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the general partner and thus a related party. JEF Capital Management owns   4,758,859   of these common units and is wholly-owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust Two for which James E. Ferrell is the trustee and sole beneficiary. The remaining   4,616   common units are held by Ferrell Resources Holding, Inc., which is wholly-owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust One, for which James E. Ferrell is the trustee and sole beneficiary. 
    
  During the   three months ended October 31, 2016  , Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership together paid the general partner distributions of $  1.0 million  . 
    
  On   December 15, 2016  , Ferrellgas Partners expects to pay distributions to Ferrell Companies, FCI Trading Corp., Ferrell Propane, Inc., James E. Ferrell (indirectly), and the general partner of $2.3 million, $20 thousand, $5 thousand, $0.5 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.  

ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  
   78 

     Table of Contents  

We did not enter into any risk management trading activities during the   three months ended October 31, 2016  . Our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be  other than trading.  
    
  Commodity price risk management 
    
  Our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short-term basis. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts.  
    
  Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  
    
  Our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, price swaps, options, futures and basis swaps to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market and with brokers who are clearing members with the New York Mercantile Exchange. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within GAAP guidance and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled. 
    
  Our risk management activities also attempt to mitigate price risks related to our crude oil line fill and inventory. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the price of crude oil or to capture market opportunities. 
    
  Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the financial markets that are equal and opposite to the forecasted crude oil line fill and inventory volume in order to minimize the risk of inventory price change. This risk management strategy locks in our sales price and is successful when our gains or losses on line fill or inventory are offset by our losses or gains in the financial markets. Our crude oil financial derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges. 
    
  Transportation Fuel Price Risk 
    
  Our risk management activities also attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase of gasoline and diesel fuel for use in the transport of propane from retail fueling stations. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. 
    
  Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the financial markets that are not more than the forecasted purchases of fuel for our internal use in the retail and supply propane delivery fleet in order to minimize the risk of decreased earnings from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy locks in our purchase price and is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the financial markets. Our transport fuel financial derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges. 
    
  Risk Policy and Sensitivity Analysis 
    
  Market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy. This policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts. We also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk, so as to manage exposures to changing market prices. 
    
  We have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options outstanding as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities. The potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a 10% adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at $  11.8 million   and   $12.4 million   as of   October 31, 2016   and   July 31, 2016  , respectively. The preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal 10%, thus actual results may differ. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the anticipated transactions associated with these transactions, which we anticipate will be 100% effective.

     Table of Contents  

Credit risk 
    
  We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of counterparties  financial condition (including credit ratings), and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines. 
    
  Our other counterparties consist of major energy companies who are suppliers, marketers, wholesalers, retailers, end users and financial institutions. The overall impact due to certain changes in economic, regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that counterparties may be similarly impacted. Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance.  
    
  At   October 31, 2016  , we had receivables from Jamex Marketing, LLC, a crude oil marketing company, totaling   $48.1 million  . On September 1, 2016, we entered into a group of agreements with Jamex which, among other things, Jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note ("Jamex Secured Promissory Note") in favor of Bridger in satisfaction of all obligations owed to Bridger under the Jamex TLA, including the   $48.1 million   owed to us on   October 31, 2016  . The Jamex Secured Promissory Note is guaranteed pursuant to a guaranty agreement, jointly by James Ballengee and Bacchus (up to a maximum aggregate amount of   $20.0 million  ), and fully guaranteed by the other Jamex entities. The obligations of Jamex and the other Jamex entities are secured by a lien on certain of those entities  assets, including Ferrellgas common units, other actively traded marketable securities and cash, which are to be held in a controlled account that can be seized by us in the event of default. 
    
  Interest rate risk 
    
  At   October 31, 2016  , we had $  489.0 million   in variable rate secured credit facility and collateralized note payable borrowings. We also have an interest rate swap that hedges a portion of the interest rate risk associated with these variable rate borrowings, as discussed in the table below. Thus, assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate, our interest rate risk related to these borrowings would result in a reduction to future earnings of $  3.3 million   for the twelve months ending   October 31,     2017  . The preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in interest rates may or may not equal one percent, thus actual results may differ. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposure by utilizing interest rate swaps. To the extent that we have debt with variable interest rates that is not hedged, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates.  
    
  We also manage a portion of our interest rate exposure associated with our fixed rate debt by utilizing an interest rate swap. A hypothetical one percent change in interest rates would result in a reduction to future earnings of   $1.4 million   for the twelve months ending   October 31,     2017  . 
    
   As discussed above, the following interest rate swaps are outstanding as of October 31, 2016, and are all designated as hedges for accounting purposes: 

ITEM 4.         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  An evaluation was performed by the management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective. 
    
  The management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the above mentioned partnerships and corporations have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of   October 31, 2016  , that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance.

During the most recent fiscal quarter ended   October 31, 2016  , there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers of combustible liquids such as propane and crude oil. As a result, at any given time, we can be threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as discussed below, we are not a party to any legal proceedings other than various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters; however, management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  We have been named as a defendant, along with a competitor, in putative class action lawsuits filed in multiple jurisdictions. The lawsuits allege that we and a competitor coordinated in 2008 to reduce the fill level in barbeque cylinders and combined to persuade a common customer to accept that fill reduction, resulting in increased cylinder costs to direct customers and end-user customers in violation of federal and certain state antitrust laws. The lawsuits seek treble damages, attorneys  fees, injunctive relief and costs on behalf of the putative class. These lawsuits have been consolidated into one case by a multidistrict litigation panel.  The Court has dismissed all claims brought by direct and indirect customers other than state law claims of indirect customers under Wisconsin, Maine and Vermont law. The direct customer plaintiffs have filed an appeal, which is pending. We believe we have strong defenses to the claims and intend to vigorously defend against the consolidated case. We do not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  In addition, putative class action cases have been filed in California relating to residual propane remaining in the tank after use.  We have prevailed at the trial court on a motion to dismiss those claims.  It is uncertain whether plaintiffs will appeal; we intend to vigorously defend any such appeal.  We do not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuit. 
    
  We have been named, along with several current and former officers, in several class action lawsuits alleging violations of certain securities laws based on alleged materially false and misleading statements in certain of our public disclosures.  The lawsuits, the first of which was filed on October 6, 2016 in the Southern District of New York, seek unspecified compensatory damages.  A derivative lawsuit with similar allegations has been filed in state court in Missouri naming Ferrellgas and several current and former officers and directors as defendants.  We believe that we have defenses and will vigorously defend these cases.  We do not believe loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to the putative class action lawsuits or the derivative action. 
    
  On October 21, 2016, Julio E. Rios II, an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC, and Jeremy H. Gamboa, also an Executive Vice President of the general partner and the Chief Operating Officer of Bridger Logistics, LLC both delivered notice of "good reason" for resignation to the general partner pursuant to their employment agreements alleging that the general partner had materially diminished their responsibilities and stating their intention to resign as a result if such purported material diminution is not cured within 30 days.  
    
  On November 28, 2016, Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa each resigned from their positions, purportedly for "good reason" pursuant to their employment agreements.  Each has indicated that they intend to make a claim for severance.  The general partner denies that Mr. Rios and Mr. Gamboa had "good reason" to resign and has other defenses to their claims for severance. We do not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time related to this matter.  

ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORS 
    
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016. 
    
  We may have difficulty maintaining compliance with the financial covenants, which include a maximum leverage ratio, in our secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. If weather continues to remain unseasonably warm or our debt reduction initiatives are unsuccessful we may be forced to seek an additional waiver or amendment to the secured credit facility and accounts receivables securitization facility.  If we were unsuccessful in obtaining these waivers or amendments it could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of our existing indebtedness. 
    
  Our secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility contain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the maximum leverage ratio will be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control, including unseasonably warm weather that reduces demand for propane and sustained low commodity prices, and our ability to execute on our debt reduction initiatives. 
  If we are unable to comply with any of the financial covenants, including the maximum leverage ratio, we will be required to negotiate a waiver or amendment to the covenant.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a waiver or amendment of covenant breaches if needed. 
  Our inability to comply with any of the covenants under our secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, in the absence of a waiver or amendment, will result in a default under both facilities.  A default under the facilities, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default that would permit the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under the facilities.  The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration under our other debt.  If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full and we may be unable to borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt, in which case our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. 
  You will be required to pay taxes on your share of our income even if you do not receive cash distributions from us. 
  You will be required to pay any federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income, including our taxable income associated with a disposition of property or cancellation of debt, whether or not you receive cash distributions from us. You may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability which results from that income. 
  As part of our debt reduction initiatives, we may engage in transactions that could have significant adverse tax consequences to our unitholders.  For example, we may sell some of our assets and use the proceeds to pay down debt or fund capital expenditures rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders, and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income and gain resulting from the sale without receiving a cash distribution.  We may also engage in transactions to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt, that could result in cancellation of indebtedness income (COD income) being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income. Any COD income may cause a unitholder to be allocated income with respect to our units with no corresponding distribution of cash to fund the payment of the resulting tax liability to the unitholder.   
  The ultimate effect of any such allocations will depend on the unitholder's individual tax position with respect to its units. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences to them of this income.
