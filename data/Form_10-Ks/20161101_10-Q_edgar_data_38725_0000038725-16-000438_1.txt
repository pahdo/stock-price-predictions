FRANKLIN ELECTRIC CO., INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   January 2, 2016  , which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of   October 1, 2016  , and for the   third   quarters and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations.  In the opinion of management, all accounting entries and adjustments (including normal, recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim period have been made.  Operating results for the   third   quarter and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  For further information, including a description of the critical accounting policies of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (the "Company"), refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  . 

2. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification, and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. 
    
  The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 during the second quarter ended July 2, 2016.  The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year 2016.  The Company has elected to continue its current policy of estimating forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures when they occur.           
  Under ASU 2016-09, excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as cash flows from operations, rather than as cash flows from financing activities.  The Company elected to apply the cash flow presentation requirements prospectively.   
    
  The standard also clarifies that cash flows related to employee taxes paid by withheld shares should be classified as a financing activity.  This provision had no impact to the Company, because these cash flows have historically been presented as financing activities.  
    
  Early adoption of the standard requires reflected adjustments as of January 3, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.  As such, previously reported first quarter 2016 results were impacted as follows:  

10 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability instead of a deferred asset.  The standard does not change the amortization of debt issuance costs, which will continue to follow the existing accounting guidance.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 during the first quarter ended April 2, 2016.  The retrospective adoption of this ASU required a total of approximately   $0.3 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs as of year-end 2015 to be reclassified from "Other assets" and "Other current assets" to a direct deduction from "Long-term debt" in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2016.  In addition, there were no impacts to the Company's results of operations, retained earnings, or cash flows in the current or previous interim and annual reporting periods.  
    
  Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases found in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 840.  This ASU requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  The Company is still in the process of analyzing the effect of this new standard to determine the impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related disclosures.   
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  .  ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.    ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations.  These ASUs are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt these standards.  The Company is still in the process of analyzing the effect of these new standards, including the transition method, to determine the impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related disclosures.

3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , provides guidance for defining, measuring, and disclosing fair value within an established framework and hierarchy.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The standard established a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value within the hierarchy are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets; 
    
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
    
  Level 3   Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as set forth in the table below: 

(In millions) 
    October 1, 2016 
    Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) 
    Significant Other Observable Inputs

The Company's Level 1 assets consist of cash equivalents which are generally made up of foreign bank guaranteed certificates of deposit.  
    
  Total debt, including current maturities, have carrying amounts of   $190.1 million   and   $220.7 million   and estimated fair values of   $194 million   and   $225 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively.  In the absence of quoted prices in active markets, considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value.  Estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market transaction.  In determining the fair value of its debt, the Company uses estimates based on rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.  Accordingly, the fair value of debt is classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.   
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   no   assets held for sale.  At   January 2, 2016  ,   $1.6 million   of assets were held for sale, recorded at carrying value in the Water Systems segment relating to an idle facility in Brazil.  The sale of the facility in Brazil was completed during the third quarter of 2016. 

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and, accordingly, is adjusted for changes in the Company s stock price at the end of each reporting period.  The Company has entered into share swap transaction agreements ("the swap") to mitigate the Company s exposure to the fluctuations in the Company's stock price.  The swap has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes and is cancellable with   30   days' written notice by either party.  As of   October 1, 2016  , the swap had a notional value based on   205,000   shares.  For the   third   quarter and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the swap resulted in gains of   $1.5 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively.  For the third quarter and nine months ended   October 3, 2015  , the swap resulted in losses of   $0.9 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively.  Gains and losses on the swap were primarily offset by gains and losses on the fair value of the deferred compensation stock liability.  All gains or losses and expenses related to the swap are recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income within the  Selling, general, and administrative expenses  line.

5. OTHER ASSETS 
  The Company has equity interests in various companies for various strategic purposes.  The investments are accounted for under the equity method and are included in  Other assets  on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The carrying amount of the investments is adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of earnings, losses, and dividends.  The investments are not considered material to the Company s financial position, neither individually nor in the aggregate.  The Company s proportionate share of earnings from its equity interests, included in the "Other income, net" line of the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income, were immaterial for the   third   quarters and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . 

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s intangible assets are as follows: 

Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the   third   quarters ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   was   $2.2 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively and   $6.3 million   and   $6.5 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is projected as follows: 

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting segment for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , is as follows: 

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  Defined Benefit Plans   - As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company maintained   two   domestic pension plans and   three   German pension plans.  The Company used a   January 2, 2016   measurement date for these plans.  One of the Company's domestic pension plans covers two management employees (one active employee and one former employee), while the other domestic plan covers all other eligible employees.  The   two   domestic and   three   German plans collectively comprise the 'Pension Benefits' disclosure caption.  
    
  Other Benefits   - The Company's other postretirement benefit plan provides health and life insurance to domestic employees hired prior to 1992. 
  
    13 

The following table sets forth the aggregated net periodic benefit cost for all pension plans for the   third   quarters and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  : 

In the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company made contributions of   $2.1 million   to the funded plans.  The amount of contributions to be made to the plans during the calendar year 2016 were finalized by September 15, 2016, based upon the plans' year-end valuation at   January 2, 2016  , and the funding level required for the plans' year ended   January 2, 2016  . 
    
  The following table sets forth the aggregated net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement benefit plan for the   third   quarters and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively: 

8. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for the nine month period ended October 1, 2016 was   25.3 percent   as compared to   11.7 percent   for the nine month period ended October 3, 2015. 
    
  The effective tax rate continues to be lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate as well as recognition of U.S. incentives and credits.  The Company has the ability to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings based on the earnings and cash projections of its other operations as well as cash on hand and available credit.   
    
  In addition during the three month period ended April 4, 2015, the Company settled the liability for the noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary during the first quarter.  This transaction created additional accretive benefits for the Company from the reversal of a deferred tax liability created in 2012 when the Company acquired the controlling interest and realized a gain on the then equity investment in such subsidiary. The Company also realized a gain on the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liability. 

14 

9. DEBT 
  Debt consisted of the following: 

Debt outstanding, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, at October 1, 2016 matures as follows: 

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method.  Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating security as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed.  The Company's participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a nonforfeitable right to receive dividends and therefore are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.  
    
  Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocated to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards. 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 
  
    15 

11.  EQUITY ROLL FORWARD 
  The schedule below sets forth equity changes in the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  : 

16 

12. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)  
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , are summarized below:   

(1) This accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component is included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (refer to Note 7 for additional details) and is included in the "Selling, general, and administrative expenses" line of the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  
    17 

13. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  Financial information by reportable business segment is included in the following summary: 

Property, plant, and equipment is the major asset group in "Other" of total assets as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  .  

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company is defending various claims and legal actions which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, based on current knowledge of the facts and after discussion with counsel, these claims and legal actions can be defended or resolved without a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and net cash flows. 
    
  At   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   $20.3 million   of commitments primarily for capital expenditures and purchase of raw materials to be used in production.  
    
  The Company provides warranties on most of its products.  The warranty terms vary but are generally   two   to   five years   from date of manufacture or   one   to   five years   from date of installation.  Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified.  These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims.  The Company actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims.  The Company believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserve. 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of the warranty accrual, as recorded in the "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" line of the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , are as follows: 

18 

15. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Company maintains the Franklin Electric Co., Inc. 2012 Stock Plan (the "2012 Stock Plan"), which is a stock-based compensation plan that provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards, and stock unit awards to key employees and non-employee directors.  
    
  The 2012 Stock Plan authorized   2,400,000   shares for issuance as follows:  

The Company also maintains the Amended and Restated Franklin Electric Co., Inc. Stock Plan (the "2009 Stock Plan") which, as amended in 2009, provided for discretionary grants of stock options and stock awards.  The 2009 Stock Plan authorized   4,400,000   shares for issuance as follows:  

All options in the 2009 Stock Plan have been awarded. 
    
  The Company currently issues new shares from its common stock balance to satisfy option exercises and the settlement of stock awards and stock unit awards made under the 2009 Stock Plan and/or the 2012 Stock Plan.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among Franklin Electric Co., Inc., Franklin Electric B.V., a Netherlands private company with limited liability ( Franklin B.V , and together with Franklin Electric Co., Inc., the  Borrowers ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan ), as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the lenders identified therein (the  Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement .  JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers.  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (which is referred to in this footnote as the  Previous Credit Agreement ) to October 28, 2021 and increased the commitment amount from   $150.0 million   to   $300.0 million  .   
    
  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides that the Borrowers may request an increase in the aggregate commitments by up to   $150.0 million   (not to exceed a total commitment of   $450.0 million  ) subject to the conditions contained therein.  All of the Company's present and future material domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guaranty all of the Borrowers' obligations under and in connection with the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Additionally, the Company unconditionally guaranties all of the obligations of Franklin B.V. under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
    
  Under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are required to pay certain fees, including a facility fee of   .100%   to   .275%   (depending on the Company's leverage ratio) of the aggregate commitment, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears.  
    
  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants include financial statements, notices of material events, conduct of business, inspection of property, maintenance of insurance, compliance with laws and most favored lender obligations. The affirmative covenants also include financial covenants with a maximum leverage ratio of   3.50   to 1.00 (using net debt in the measure of leverage ratio, whereas the Previous Credit Agreement used gross debt in such measure) and an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than   3.00   to 1.00 (using EBITDA in the measure, whereas the Previous Credit Agreement used EBIT). Under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the priority debt cap is measured as   20 percent   of total tangible assets, whereas the Previous Credit Agreement used net equity rather than total tangible assets. The negative covenants include limitations on loans or advances, investments, and the granting of liens by the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as prohibitions on certain consolidations, mergers, sales and transfers of assets (which restrictions on sales and transfers of assets were reduced to some degree versus the Previous Credit Agreement).   
    
  As was the case in the Previous Credit Agreement, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of defaults (with customary grace periods, as applicable, for certain of those events of default). If an event of default occurs, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides that (i) the commitments may be terminated and (ii) the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable. For certain events of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation, the commitments are automatically terminated and the loans outstanding automatically become due and payable. The full amount of the aggregate commitment may be borrowed as multicurrency loans, in Euros, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Canadian Dollars or any other agreed currency.  
    
  As in the Previous Credit Agreement, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for a swingline loan sub-facility of up to   $15.0 million   (with an additional discretionary amount of up to   $15.0 million  , which was not included under the Previous Credit Agreement), and a letter of credit subfacility of up to   $50.0 million   (increased from   $25.0 million   under the Previous Credit Agreement).  
    
  Loans may be made either at (i) a Eurocurrency rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin of   .75%   to   1.60%   (depending on the Company's leverage ratio) or (ii) an alternative base rate as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also includes a competitive bid option that permits the Borrowers to request that the lenders provide bids for the interest rate that will apply to specific loans. 
    
  In addition, on October 28, 2016, the Company entered into (1) First Amendment (the  First Amendment ) to Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement dated as of May 27, 2015 (the  New York Life Agreement ) by and among NYL Investors LLC and each of the undersigned holders of notes that are signatories thereto, and (2) Amendment No. 1 ( Amendment No. 1  and together with the First Amendment, the  Private Shelf Amendments ) to Third Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement dated as of May 28, 2015 (the  Prudential Agreement ) by and among the Company and PGIM, Inc. ( Prudential ) and the Prudential affiliates party thereto.  The Private Shelf Amendments were intended to make the covenants within the New York Life Agreement and Prudential Agreement consistent with those covenants that were modified in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as compared to the Previous Credit Agreement.    

21 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Private Shelf Amendments, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.2 - 10.4 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Third Quarter 2016 vs. Third Quarter 2015  
    
  OVERVIEW 
  Sales and earnings in the third quarter of 2016 increased from the third quarter last year.  The sales increase was due to price and volume partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  The Company's consolidated gross profit was $85.5 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $8.7 million or about 11 percent from the prior year s third quarter. 
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the third quarter of 2016 were $239.8 million, an increase of $7.3 million or about 3 percent compared to 2015 third quarter sales of $232.5 million.  Sales revenue decreased by $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 due to foreign currency translation.  The sales change in the third quarter of 2016, excluding foreign currency translation, was an increase of $7.8 million or about 3 percent. 

Net Sales-Water Systems 
  Water Systems sales were $182.0 million in the third quarter 2016, an increase of $8.5 million or about 5 percent versus the third quarter 2015 sales of $173.5 million.  Water Systems sales were reduced by $0.2 million in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.  Excluding foreign currency translation, Water Systems sales were up about 5 percent compared to the third quarter 2015. 
    
  Water Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada represented 37 percent of consolidated sales and increased by about 2 percent compared to the prior year.  Water Systems sales in the U.S and Canada were reduced by $0.1 million in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.  In the third quarter 2016, sales of groundwater pumping equipment grew by about 13 percent.  The growth in groundwater equipment sales was led by a 17 percent increase in residential systems.  Sales of groundwater pumping systems for agricultural applications grew by about 2 percent.  Third quarter 2016 sales of mobile dewatering equipment in the U.S. and Canada declined sharply due to reduced demand from equipment rental customer. 
    
  Water Systems sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were about 16 percent of consolidated sales and declined by about 3 percent compared to the third quarter 2015.  Water Systems sales were reduced by about 3 percent in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.  Sales in  the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were flat excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  Within this region, our business unit in Turkey had increased sales which were offset by lower sales in other regional business units primarily due to the political and economic turmoil in certain parts of the region as well as the lower price of oil. 
    
  Water Systems sales in Latin America were about 15 percent of consolidated sales for the third quarter and increased by about 15 percent compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Water Systems sales grew by $0.9 million or about 3 percent in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Latin American sales increased by about 12 percent compared to the third quarter 2015.  This growth in sales was led by increased sales in Brazil and Mexico.  This sales growth is a result of increasing demand for Franklin submersible pumps and motors, customer acceptance of the many product line upgrades that have been implemented over the past two years, and general market conditions. 
  
    22 

Water Systems sales in the Asia Pacific region were 8 percent of consolidated sales and grew about 19 percent compared to the third quarter prior year.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia Pacific sales grew by about 18 percent compared to the third quarter 2015.  The Asia Pacific region experienced year over year growth in groundwater product sales of 24 percent due in part to generally favorable weather conditions. 
    
  Net Sales-Fueling Systems 
  Fueling Systems sales represented 24 percent of consolidated sales and were $57.8 million in the third quarter 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million or about 2 percent versus the third quarter 2015 sales of $59.0 million.  Fueling Systems sales decreased by $0.3 million or about 1 percent in the quarter due to foreign currency translation.  Fueling Systems sales decreased by $0.9 million or about 1 percent after excluding foreign currency translation. 
    
  Fueling Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada grew by about 5 percent during the quarter with most of the sales growth coming from fuel pumping products, piping and containment systems.  Fueling Systems revenues were down in Europe and Asia Pacific in part due to lower capital spending on new filling station development by major oil companies and due to the timing of customer shipments. 
    
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 was 64.4 percent and 67.0 percent, respectively. Correspondingly, the gross profit margin increased to 35.6 percent from 33.0 percent, a 260 basis point improvement.  The Company s consolidated gross profit was $85.5 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $8.7 million, or about 11 percent, from the third quarter of 2015 gross profit of $76.8 million.  The gross profit margin increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, lower direct material costs and an improved sales mix of Water Systems products. 
    
  Selling, General, and Administrative ( SG A ) 
  Selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses were $55.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $47.7 million in the third quarter of prior year, an increase of $7.7 million or about 16 percent.  The Company s SG A expense increase in the quarter was primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses of about $4.0 million.  Marketing and Selling related expenses increased about $1.0 million to support sales growth and Research Development   Engineering (RD E) expense increased by $0.8 million in the quarter. 
    
  Restructuring (Income)/Expense 
  Restructuring income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.7 million and caused a $0.02 increase in diluted earnings per share. Restructuring income for the third quarter 2016 included a gain of $2.0 million from the sale of land and building in Brazil and $0.3 million in expenses related to equipment transfers, freight and relocation cost related to the transfer of production activities and other restructuring costs from continued manufacturing realignments. 
    
  Restructuring expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.3 million and caused a $0.02 reduction in diluted earnings per share. Restructuring expenses for the third quarter 2015 included $0.6 million in severance cost, $0.1 million in expenses related to equipment transfers, freight and relocation cost primarily in Europe related to the transfer of production activities from Germany to the Czech Republic and $0.6 million of other restructuring costs from continued manufacturing realignments. 
    
  Operating Income 
  Operating income was $31.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $4.0 million or about 14 percent from $27.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. 

There were specific items in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 that impacted operating income that were not operational in nature.  In the third quarter of 2016 there were two such items: $1.7 million of restructuring income and $0.3 million related to  
  
    23 

executive transition. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2015 there were three such items: $1.3 million of restructuring charges, $0.3 million related to executive transition and $0.1 million related to business realignment cost, primarily severance, in targeted fixed cost reduction actions. 
    
  The Company refers to these items as  non-GAAP adjustments  for purposes of presenting the non-GAAP financial measures of operating income after non-GAAP adjustments and percent operating income to net sales after non GAAP adjustments (operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments).  The Company believes this information helps investors understand underlying trends in the Company's business more easily.  The differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP measures are reconciled in the following tables: 

Operating Income-Water Systems 
  Water Systems operating income was $30.0 million in the third quarter 2016, up $6.9 million or 30 percent versus the third quarter 2015 as reported and up $3.7 million or 15 percent versus the third quarter 2015 after non-GAAP adjustments.  The third quarter operating income margin was 16.5 percent, up 320 basis points from 13.3 percent in the third quarter of 2015.  The third quarter operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments was 15.5 percent, an increase of 140 basis points from the 14.1 percent of net sales in the third quarter of 2015 after non-GAAP adjustments.  The increase in basis points was primarily due to improved margins from lower variable costs. 
    
  Operating Income-Fueling Systems 
  Fueling Systems operating income was $15.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $0.2 million or about 1 percent compared to $15.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 as reported, and down $0.1 million or 1 percent compared to $15.4 million after non-GAAP adjustments in the third quarter of 2015.  The third quarter operating income margin was 26.3 percent, an increase of 20 basis points from the as reported 26.1 percent of net sales in the third quarter of 2015.  The third quarter operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments was 26.5 percent, an increase of 40 basis points from the 26.1 percent of net sales in the third quarter of 2015 after non-GAAP adjustments.  The increase in basis points was primarily due to improved  
  
    24 

margins from lower variable costs. 
    
  Operating Income-Other 
  Operating income-other is composed primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses after non-GAAP adjustments were higher by about 26 percent, primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 was $2.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, lower primarily due to reduced average borrowings outstanding. 
    
  Other Income or Expense 
  Other income or expense was income of $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and income of $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Included in other income in the third quarter of 2016 was income from minority interests of $1.2 million and interest income of $0.2 million, primarily derived from the investment of cash balances in short-term securities.  Included in other income in the third quarter of 2015 was minority income of $1.0 million and interest income of $0.3 million, primarily derived from the investment of cash balances in short-term securities.  
    
  Foreign Exchange 
  Foreign currency-based transactions produced a gain for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.4 million.  Foreign currency-based transactions produced a loss for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.1 million. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 was $7.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was about 27 percent, flat to the third quarter 2015 tax rate before discrete adjustments.  The tax rate after discrete adjustments as a percentage of pre-tax earnings for the third quarter of 2016 was about 25 percent primarily due to the favorable impact from share based equity compensation payments.  The projected tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings and reduced taxes on foreign and repatriated earnings after the restructuring of certain foreign entities.  The Company has the ability to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings based on the earnings and cash projections of its other operations, current cash on hand and available credit. 
    
  Net Income 
  Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $23.7 million compared to the prior year third quarter net income of $21.0 million.  Net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. for the third quarter of 2016 was $23.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to the prior year third quarter net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. of $20.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share.  Earnings after non-GAAP adjustments for the third quarter of 2016 were $22.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to the prior year third quarter earnings after non-GAAP adjustments of $21.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. 
    
  There were specific items in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 that impacted net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. that were not operational in nature.  The Company refers to these items as  non-GAAP adjustments  for purposes of presenting the non-GAAP financial measures of earnings after non-GAAP adjustments and adjusted EPS.  The Company believes this information helps investors understand underlying trends in the Company's business more easily.  The differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP measures are reconciled in the following tables: 

25 

First Nine Months of 2016 vs. First Nine Months of 2015 
    
  OVERVIEW 
  Sales and earnings in the first nine months of 2016 were up from the same period last year.  The sales increase was related to volume and price increases partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation on sales. The Company's consolidated gross profit was $250.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $21.9 million or about 10 percent from the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales in the first nine months of 2016 were $710.3 million, an increase of $4.7 million or about 1 percent compared to sales in the first nine months of 2015 of $705.6 million.  The incremental impact of sales from acquired businesses was $0.7 million.  Sales revenue decreased by $21.8 million or about 3 percent in the first nine months of 2016 due to foreign currency translation.  The sales change in the first nine months of 2016, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation, was an increase of $25.8 million or about 4 percent. 

26 

Net Sales-Water Systems 
  Water Systems sales were $545.4 million in the first nine months 2016, flat versus the first nine months 2015.  The incremental impact of sales from acquired businesses was $0.7 million.  Foreign currency translation rate changes decreased sales $20.7 million, or about 4 percent, compared to sales in the first nine months of 2015.

  Water Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada were 37 percent of consolidated sales and increased by about 2 percent compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Sales revenue decreased by $1.9 million or about 1 percent in the first nine months of 2016 due to foreign currency translation.  Sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased by about 7 percent.  The growth in groundwater equipment sales was led by a 10 percent increase in residential systems.  Sales of groundwater pumping systems for agricultural applications grew by about 2 percent.  Sales of Pioneer branded mobile dewatering equipment declined by about 14 percent.  The decline in mobile dewatering equipment is primarily attributed to reduced demand in the oil and gas end markets. 
    
  Water Systems sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa were about 18 percent of consolidated sales and declined by about 6 percent compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Water Systems in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were reduced by $8.2 million or about 6 percent due to foreign currency translation.  Sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were flat excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  Within this region, our business unit in Turkey had increased sales which were offset by lower sales in other regional business units primarily due to the political and economic turmoil in certain parts of the region as well as the lower price of oil. 
    
  Water Systems sales in Latin America were about 13 percent of consolidated sales for the first nine months and declined by about 4 percent compared to the prior year's first nine months.  Sales revenue decreased by $10.1 million or about 10 percent in the first nine months of 2016 due to foreign currency translation.  The sales change in the first nine months of 2016, excluding foreign currency translation, was an increase of $6.1 million or about 6 percent.  The growth in sales was led by increased sales in Mexico and Brazil, in local currency.  This sales growth is a result of increasing demand for Franklin submersible pumps and motors, customer acceptance of the many product line upgrades that have been implemented over the past two years, and general market conditions. 
    
  Water Systems sales in the Asia Pacific region were 9 percent of consolidated sales and increased by about 15 percent compared to the first nine months of the prior year.

Foreign currency translation rate changes decreased sales $1.1 million or about 1 percent compared to sales in the first nine months of 2015.  The Fueling Systems sales change in the first nine months of 2016, excluding foreign currency translation, was an increase of $4.7 million or about 3 percent. 
    
  Fueling Systems sales in the U.S. and Canada grew by about 6 percent during the first nine months with sales growth coming from most product lines, especially in piping.  Outside the U.S. and Canada, Fueling Systems revenues were down overall with increased sales in India more than offset by a sales decline in Europe principally due to a reduction in the sale of storage tanks that support North Sea oil production. 

27 

Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was 64.7 percent and 67.6 percent, respectively.

The gross profit margin increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, lower direct material costs and lower fixed costs. 
    
  Selling, General, and Administrative ( SG A ) 
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $165.7 million in the first nine months of 2016 and increased by $6.5 million or 4 percent in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $159.2 million the first nine months of last year.  The Company s SG A expense increase in the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses of about $6.5 million and RD E spending of $1.2 million on new product development costs.  These increases were partially offset by lower fixed cost from the effect of foreign currency translation.

    There was $0.9 million of restructuring income. Restructuring included a gain of $2.0 million from the sale of land and building in Brazil and restructuring expenses of $1.1 million in other miscellaneous manufacturing realignment activities, primarily related to the continued European and Brazilian realignment activities.  
                
    Executive transition costs were $0.9 million.  
       
  In the first nine months of 2015 they were as follows:  
             
    There were $2.5 million of restructuring charges.  Restructuring expenses were severance expenses and other miscellaneous manufacturing realignment activities, primarily related to the continued European and Brazilian realignment activities.  
                
    Executive transition costs were $0.9 million.  
                
    Business realignment cost, primarily severance, in targeted fixed cost reduction actions of $0.5 million. 
                
    Other miscellaneous costs related to closed and pending acquisitions were $0.2 million. 
       
  The Company refers to these items as  non-GAAP adjustments  for purposes of presenting the non-GAAP financial measures of operating income after non-GAAP adjustments and percent operating income to net sales after non-GAAP adjustments  
  
    28 

(operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments).  The Company believes this information helps investors understand underlying trends in the Company's business more easily.  The differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP measures are reconciled in the following tables: 

Operating Income-Water Systems 
  Water Systems operating income was $85.6 million in the first none months of 2016, up $18.8 million or 28 percent versus the first nine months of 2015 as reported and up $14.6 million or 21 percent versus the first nine months of 2015 after non-GAAP adjustments.  The first nine months of 2016 as reported operating income margin was 15.7 percent, up 340 basis points from 12.3 percent in the first nine months of 2015.  The first nine months operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments was 15.4 percent and increased by 260 basis points compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments increased in Water Systems primarily due to pricing, lower direct material costs and operating leverage. 
    
  Operating Income-Fueling Systems 
  Fueling Systems operating income was $40.9 million in the first nine months of 2016, up $3.5 million or about 9 percent compared to $37.4 million in the first nine months of 2015 as reported, and up $3.6 million or 10 percent compared to $37.8 million after non-GAAP adjustments in the first nine months of 2015.  The first nine months of 2016 as reported operating income margin was 24.8 percent, an increase of 160 basis points from the as reported 23.2 percent of net sales in the first nine months of 2015.  The first nine months operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments was 25.1 percent up 170 basis points compared to the 23.4 percent of net sales in the first nine months of 2015.  Operating income margin after non-GAAP adjustments increased in Fueling Systems due to pricing, lower direct material costs and operating leverage. 
    
  Operating Income-Other 
  Operating income-other is composed primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses after non-GAAP adjustments were up about 10 percent compared to last year primarily due to higher incentive compensation. 

29 

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $6.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. 
    
  Other Income or Expense 
  Other income or expense was a gain of $2.8 million in the first nine months of 2016.  Included in other income in the first nine months of 2016 was minority income $1.7 million and interest income of $0.8 million, primarily derived from the investment of cash balances in short-term securities.  The first nine months of 2015 was a gain of $6.0 million.  Included in other income in the first nine months of 2015 was minority income $2.7 million and interest income of $0.6 million, primarily derived from the investment of cash balances in short-term securities.  The Company also realized a gain on the redeemable non-controlling interest liability in the first nine months of 2015 of about $2.7 million.  
    
  Foreign Exchange 
  Foreign currency-based transactions produced a gain for the first nine months of 2016 of $0.6 million.  Foreign currency-based transactions had no impact for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $20.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was about 25 percent and, before the impact of discrete events, was about 27 percent.  Discrete adjustments during the first nine months of 2016 were primarily due to the favorable impact from equity compensation share based payments.  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 was about 12 percent and, before the impact of discrete events, was about 27 percent.  Discrete adjustments during the first nine months of 2015 were the reversal of a deferred tax liability created in 2012 when the Company acquired the controlling interest in the Pioneer subsidiary and realized a gain on the then equity investment in Pioneer.  This first nine months tax benefit of about $4.8 million was treated as a non-GAAP adjustment.  Because in 2012, the gain was treated as a non-GAAP adjustment, the Company is now consistently treating the reversal of the tax liability related to that gain as a non-GAAP adjustment and reducing reported Earnings per Share in the first nine months of 2015 by $0.10 cents.  The Company also realized a gain on the redeemable non-controlling interest liability in the first nine months of 2015 of about $2.7 million which is included in  Other income .  This purchase transaction also resulted in other tax benefits of about $2.5 million, which were expensed through the Company s earnings in prior years as well as a 2015 benefit of about $1.0 million related to the 2015 gain.  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was about 27 percent before discrete adjustments.  The projected tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings and reduced taxes on foreign and repatriated earnings after the restructuring of certain foreign entities.  The Company has the ability to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings based on the earnings and cash projections of its other operations, current cash on hand and available credit. 
    
  Net Income 
  Net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $61.5 million compared to 2015 first nine months net income of $57.4 million.  Net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. for the first nine months of 2016 was $61.1 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to 2015 first nine months net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. of $56.8 million or $1.17 per diluted share.  Earnings after non-GAAP adjustments for the first nine months of 2016 were $59.7 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to the prior year first nine months earnings after non-GAAP adjustments of $53.6 million or $1.12 per diluted share. 
    
  There were specific items in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 that impacted net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. that were not operational in nature.  The Company refers to these items as  non-GAAP adjustments  for purposes of presenting the non-GAAP financial measures of earnings after non-GAAP adjustments and adjusted EPS.  The Company believes this information helps investors understand underlying trends in the Company's business more easily.  The differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP measures are reconciled in the following tables:

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Overview 
  The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, revolving credit agreement, and long-term debt funds available. 
    
  On May 27, 2015, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured private shelf agreement with NYL Investors LLC, an affiliate of New York Life (the "New York Life Agreement") for $150.0 million maximum aggregate principal borrowing capacity and the Company authorized the issuance of $75.0 million of floating rate senior notes due May 27, 2025. These senior notes have a floating interest rate of one-month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 1.35 percent with interest-only payments due on a monthly basis.  As of October 1, 2016, there was $75.0 million remaining borrowing capacity under the New York Life Agreement. 
    
  On December 31, 2012, the Company, Allen County, Indiana and certain institutional investors entered into a Bond Purchase and Loan Agreement.  Under the agreement, Allen County, Indiana issued a series of Project Bonds entitled  Taxable Economic Development Bonds, Series 2012 (Franklin Electric Co., Inc. Project)."  The aggregate principal amount of the Project Bonds that were issued and authenticated was limited to $25.0 million.  The Company then borrowed the proceeds under the Project  
  
    31 

Bonds through the issuance of Project Notes to finance the cost of acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the new Global Corporate Headquarters and Engineering Center. These Project Notes (tax increment financing debt) bear interest at 3.6 percent per annum.  Interest and principal balance of the Project Notes are due and payable by the Company directly to the institutional investors in aggregate semi-annual installments commencing on July 10, 2013, and concluding on January 10, 2033.  On May 5, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Bond Purchase and Loan Agreement.  This amendment provided for debt repayment guarantees from certain Company subsidiaries and waived certain non-financial covenants related to subsidiary guarantees.   
    
  On April 9, 2007, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (as amended as described in this paragraph, the "Prudential Agreement") in the amount of $175.0 million.  Under the Prudential Agreement, the Company issued notes in an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million on April 30, 2007 (the  B-1 Notes ) and $40.0 million on September 7, 2007 (the  B-2 Notes ).  The B-1 Notes and B-2 Notes bear a coupon of 5.79 percent and had at issuance an average life of 10 years with a final maturity in 2019.  On July 22, 2010, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Prudential Agreement to increase its borrowing capacity by $25.0 million.  On December 14, 2011, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement to redefine the debt to EBITDA ratio covenant in order to be equivalent to that under the Credit Agreement.  On December 31, 2012, the Company and Prudential Insurance Company of America entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement to extend the effective date to December 31, 2015.  On May 5, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement.   This amendment provided for debt repayment guarantees from certain Company subsidiaries and waived certain non-financial covenants related to subsidiary guarantees.  On May 28, 2015, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential to increase the total borrowing capacity from $200.0 million to $250.0 million.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company has $100.0 million borrowing capacity available under the Prudential Agreement.  Principal installments of $30.0 million are payable annually commencing on April 30, 2015 and continuing to and including April 30, 2019, with any unpaid balance due at maturity.   
    
  On December 14, 2006, the Company entered into an amended and restated unsecured, 60-month $120.0 million revolving credit agreement (as amended as described in this paragraph, the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement provides for various borrowing rate options including interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus interest spreads keyed to the Company s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ).  On December 14, 2011, the Company executed the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement to December 14, 2016, and increased the commitment amount to $150.0 million.  On May 5, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement.  This amendment provided for debt repayment guarantees from certain Company subsidiaries and waived certain non-financial covenants related to subsidiary guarantees.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company had $144.5 million borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement as $5.5 million in letters of commercial and standby letters of credit were outstanding and undrawn and no revolver borrowing was drawn and outstanding as of the end of the quarter.  
    
  The New York Life Agreement, the Project Bonds, the Prudential Agreement, and the Credit Agreement contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants relate to financial statements, notices of material events, conduct of business, inspection of property, maintenance of insurance, compliance with laws, and most favored lender obligations. The negative covenants include limitations on loans, advances and investments, and the granting of liens by the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as prohibitions on certain consolidations, mergers, sales, and transfers of assets. The covenants also include financial requirements, including a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. Cross default is applicable with the New York Life Agreement, the Project Bonds, the Prudential Agreement, and the Credit Agreement, but only if the Company is defaulting on an obligation exceeding $10.0 million.  As of October 1, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.  The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operations, capital expenditures, pension obligations, dividends, and debt service will be adequately funded from cash on hand, operations, and existing credit agreements.  
    
  At October 1, 2016, the Company had   $79.0 million   of cash on hand at various locations worldwide.  Approximately 12 percent of the cash on hand was in the U.S. and readily accessible.  Approximately 59 percent was in Europe, and the remaining 29 percent was in Mexico, Asia Pacific, and other locations combined.  On a regular basis the Company reviews international cash balances and, if appropriate based on forecasted expenditures and considerations for the post-tax economic efficiency, will reposition cash among its global entities.  Global cash balances are invested according to a written policy, and are generally in bank demand accounts and bank time deposits with the preservation of principal as the highest priority. 
    
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into certain amendments to the Credit Agreement, New York Life Agreement and Prudential Agreement, as described in footnote 17 - Subsequent Event.

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $70.9 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 compared to $60.3 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2015.  The increase in cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2016 in comparison to the first nine months of 2015 was largely attributable to large cash outflows in the first half of 2015 related to restructuring costs previously accrued at year-end 2014.  In addition, during the first quarter of 2015, the mandatory share purchase liability of $22.9 million for Pioneer was settled, resulting in a non-cash gain and reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities, also non-cash, both of which were adjustments to net income.  
    
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was $25.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 compared to $18.4 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures during the current period including the purchase of a building during the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was $48.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 compared to cash used of $10.1 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2015.  During the nine months ended October 3, 2015, the Company incurred higher borrowings to fund operating requirements and for the Pioneer mandatory share purchase liability and common stock repurchases.   
    
  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking information, such as statements about the Company s financial goals, acquisition strategies, financial expectations including anticipated revenue or expense levels, business prospects, market positioning, product development, manufacturing re-alignment, capital expenditures, tax benefits and expenses, and the effect of contingencies or changes in accounting policies. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   may increase,   may fluctuate,   plan,   goal,   target,   strategy,  and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as  may,   will,   should,   would,  and  could.  While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on present conditions, forward-looking statements made by the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including regional or general economic and currency conditions, various conditions specific to the Company s business and industry, new housing starts, weather conditions, market demand, competitive factors, changes in distribution channels, supply constraints, effect of price increases, raw material costs and availability, technology factors, integration of acquisitions, litigation, government and regulatory actions, the Company s accounting policies, and other risks, all as described in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, included in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  , and in Exhibit 99.1 thereto. Any forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q are based upon information presently available. The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking information, except as required by law. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  There have been no significant changes in the Company's exposure to market risk during the   third   quarter ended   October 1, 2016  .  For additional information, refer to Part II, Item 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15.  Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company began the process of a multi-year implementation of a global enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.  The new ERP system was designed to better support our business needs in response to the changing operating environment.  The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness as the implementation progresses. The Company expects that the new ERP system will enhance the overall system of internal controls over financial reporting through further automation and integration of business processes, although it is not being implemented in response to any identified deficiency in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.   
  
    33 

Other than the ERP implementation, there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10.1 
  EMPLOYMENT SECURITY AGREEMENT 
  This Employment Security Agreement ( Agreement ) is entered into as of the 12th day of September, 2016, by and between Franklin Electric Co., Inc., an Indiana corporation ( Franklin ), and Jonathan M. Grandon ( Executive ).

  WHEREAS  , Executive and Franklin desire to enter into this Agreement pertaining to the terms of the security Franklin is providing to Executive with respect to his employment. 
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.  Definitions  .    For purposes of this Agreement:

  (c)           Change in Control    means the occurrence of any of the following events: 
  (i)        any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity (other than Franklin or a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of Franklin), or any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Franklin representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of Franklin s then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; 
  (ii)        Franklin is party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization or other similar transaction with another corporation or other legal person unless, following such transaction, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the surviving, resulting or acquiring corporation or person or its parent  
  
   -1-     

entity entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or persons performing similar functions) is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of Franklin s outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors immediately prior to such transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such transaction, of Franklin s outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; 
  (iii)        The stockholders of Franklin approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of Franklin or Franklin sells all or substantially all of its business and/or assets to another corporation or other legal person unless, following such sale, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the acquiring corporation or person or its parent entity entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or persons performing similar functions) is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of Franklin s outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors immediately prior to such sale, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such sale, of Franklin s outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur by virtue of any transaction in which Executive is a participant in a group effecting an acquisition of Franklin if Executive holds an equity interest in the entity acquiring Franklin at the time of such acquisition. 
  (d)           Good Cause    means: 
  (i)        Executive s intentional and material misappropriation of, or damage to, the property or business of Franklin;  
  (ii)        Executive s conviction of a criminal violation involving fraud or dishonesty or of a felony that causes material harm or injury (whether financial or otherwise) to Franklin; or 
  (iii)        Executive s willful and continuous failure to perform his obligations under the Agreement, provided that Franklin shall first give written notice to Executive describing such failure and, as long as it is capable of being cured and  
  
   -2-     

does not involve acts of material dishonesty directed against Franklin, Executive does not substantially cure or correct such failure within 30 days thereafter, or if such failure can not reasonably be cured within such period, cure is not commenced within such period and diligently pursued and fully cured within 60 days of Franklin s original notice to Executive. 
  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event Franklin terminates the employment of Executive for Good Cause hereunder, Franklin shall give Executive at least 30 days  prior written notice specifying in detail the reason or reasons for Executive s termination. 
  (e)           Good Reason    means: 
  (i)        a material reduction in Executive s salary or retirement benefits or a material reduction in Executive s compensation and benefits in the aggregate, excluding, in the case of incentive benefits that are based upon the performance of Executive or Franklin, reductions in benefits resulting from diminished performance by Executive or Franklin;  
  (ii)        any purchaser (or affiliate thereof) who purchases substantially all of the assets of Franklin shall decline to assume all of Franklin s obligations under this Agreement; or 
  (iii)    the relocation of the Executive s principal place of employment by more than 50 miles. 
  (f)           Severance Period    means the period beginning on the date Executive s employment with Franklin terminates under circumstances described in Section 2 and ending on the date 24 months thereafter. 
  (g)           Target Bonus    means the amount that would be payable to Executive under the Executive Officer Annual Incentive Cash Bonus Program or any successor plan thereto for the year in which Executive s employment with Franklin terminates, assuming attainment of the target performance goals at 100% level and employment of Executive at the end of such year (such amount to be determined regardless of whether Executive would otherwise be eligible for a bonus under the terms of any such plan or the extent to which the performance goals are actually met). 
  2.        Termination of Employment  .    If within two years after a Change in Control, (a) Franklin terminates Executive s employment for any reason other than Good Cause, or (b) Executive terminates his employment with Franklin for Good Reason, Franklin shall make the payments and provide the benefits described in Section 3 below. 
  3.        Benefits Upon Termination of Employment  .    Upon termination of Executive s employment with Franklin under circumstances described in Section 2 above: 
  
   -3-     

(a)        Within 30 days following the date of such termination, Franklin shall pay Executive a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i), (ii) and (iii) below: 
  (i)    unpaid Base Salary earned by Executive through the date of termination (which shall include payment for all accrued but unused vacation pay); 
  (ii)    two times Executive s Base Salary; and 
  (iii)    an amount equal to the sum of (A) a  pro rata portion of Executive s Target Bonus (based on the date on which such termination of employment occurs), and (B) two times Executive s Target Bonus. 
  (b)        Franklin shall pay Executive a lump sum payment (calculated based on his age as of his termination of employment) within 30 days following his termination of employment of an amount equal to the increase in benefits under all tax-qualified and supplemental retirement plans maintained by Franklin in which Executive participates at termination of employment that results from crediting Executive with an additional 24 months of service for all purposes (including determining service and age for early retirement factors, if applicable) under such plans, and deeming Executive to be an employee of Franklin during the Severance Period. The amounts attributable to additional benefits under any such plan shall be based on Executive s compensation level as of his termination of employment.  The amounts attributable to additional benefits under any retirement plan that is a defined contribution plan shall include the additional Franklin contributions that would have been made or credited on Executive s behalf had he authorized the same elective contributions he had elected for the year in which the termination of employment occurs, and shall include earnings that would have accrued under the applicable plan during the Severance Period (the earnings will be determined by multiplying the aggregate contributions to each such plan by the weighted average of the rate of return of the actual investment alternatives elected by Executive as of the beginning of the 12-month period ending on the employment termination date).  Benefits accrued under such plans prior to Executive s termination of employment shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such plans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment under this Section 3(b) shall be offset by the lump sum value of the amounts of additional benefits paid or payable in accordance with the terms of such plans as a result of the occurrence of a Change in Control but not below zero. 
  (c)        If Executive holds any stock-based awards as of the date of his termination of employment, (i) all such awards that are stock options shall immediately become exercisable on such date and shall be exercisable for 12 months following such termination of employment, or if earlier, until the expiration of the term of the stock option; (ii) all restrictions on any awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units shall terminate or lapse; and (iii) all performance goals applicable to any performance-based awards shall be deemed satisfied at the target performance level, and in each case settlement of such awards shall be made to Executive within 30 days of Executive s termination.  To the extent any of the foregoing is not permissible under the terms of any plan pursuant to which the awards were granted, Franklin shall pay to Executive, in a lump sum within 30 days after termination of Executive s employment, an amount as follows:  (A) to the extent the acceleration of the exercise of such stock options is not permissible, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of  
  
   -4-     

the aggregate fair market value of the stock subject to such options, determined on the date of Executive s termination of employment, over the aggregate exercise price of such stock options; (B) to the extent the termination or lapse of restrictions on restricted stock or restricted stock units is not permissible, an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value of the stock subject to the restrictions (determined without regard to such restrictions); and (C) to the extent performance awards are limited, an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value of the additional shares that were not awarded.  Executive shall surrender all outstanding awards for which payment pursuant to the preceding sentence is made. 
  (d)        During the Severance Period, Executive and his spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to be covered by all employee benefit plans of Franklin providing health, prescription drug, dental, vision, disability and life insurance in which he or his spouse or eligible dependents were participating immediately prior to the date of his termination of employment, as if he continued to be an active employee of Franklin, and Franklin shall continue to pay the costs of such coverage under such plans on the same basis as is applicable to active employees covered thereunder; provided that, if participation in any one or more of such plans is not possible under the terms thereof, Franklin shall provide substantially identical benefits. The date of Executive s termination of employment shall be considered a  qualifying event  as such term is defined in Title I, Part 6 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( COBRA ), and any continued coverage by Executive, his spouse or eligible dependents under Franklin s group health plan after Executive s termination of employment shall be considered COBRA coverage. 
  (e)        During the Severance Period, Executive will receive 12 months of executive outplacement services (not to exceed $50,000) with a professional outplacement firm selected by Franklin. 
  (f)        If at the time of Executive s termination of employment for reasons other than death he is a  Key Employee  as determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(i), any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement that are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code shall not be paid or commence to be paid until six months following Executive s termination of employment, or if earlier, Executive s subsequent death, with the first payment to include the payments that otherwise would have been made during such period and including interest accruing thereon from the first day of the month following the date of such termination of employment until the date of payment, based on the applicable interest rate as defined in Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Each payment made pursuant to Section 3 shall be considered a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. 
  4.        Release of Claims  .      Payment by Franklin of the termination benefits provided in Section 3 hereof shall be conditioned on Executive s execution, and nonrevocation, of a release of claims.  Payment of such termination benefits shall be delayed until the expiration of the revocation period applicable to the executed release of claims, provided that if Executive does not execute the release of claims within 60 days of the date of termination of employment, the termination benefits described in Section shall be forfeited and Executive shall be entitled to receive only the benefits to which he is otherwise entitled under applicable law. 
  
   -5-     

5.        Death  .    If Executive dies during the Severance Period, all amounts payable hereunder to Executive, to the extent not paid, shall be paid, within 30 days of the date of Executive s death, to his surviving spouse or his designated beneficiary, or if none, then to his estate.  Executive s surviving spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to be covered under plans described in Section 3(d) during the remainder of the Severance Period.  On the death of the surviving spouse and eligible dependents, no further coverage under such plans shall be provided (other than any coverage required pursuant to COBRA). 
  6.        Excise Tax  .   
  (a)        If in connection with the Change in Control or other event Executive would be or is subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (an  Excise Tax ) with respect to any cash, benefits or other property received, or any acceleration of vesting of any benefit or award (the  Change in Control Benefits ), Executive may elect to have the Change in Control Benefits otherwise payable under this Agreement reduced to the largest amount payable without resulting in the imposition of such Excise Tax.  Within 15 days after the occurrence of the event that triggers the Excise Tax, a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by Franklin shall make a determination as to whether any Excise Tax would be reported with respect to the Change in Control Benefits and, if so, the amount of the Excise Tax, the total net after-tax amount of the Change in Control Benefits (after taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax) and the amount of reduction to the Change in Control Benefits necessary to avoid such Excise Tax.  Any reduction to the Change in Control Benefits shall first be made from any cash benefits payable pursuant to this Agreement, if any, and thereafter, as determined by Executive, and Franklin shall provide Executive with such information as is necessary to make such determination. Franklin shall be responsible for all fees and expenses connected with the determinations by the accounting firm pursuant to this paragraph 6. 
  (b)        Executive agrees to notify Franklin in the event of any audit or other proceeding by the IRS or any taxing authority in which the IRS or other taxing authority asserts that any Excise Tax should be assessed against Executive and to cooperate with Franklin in contesting any such proposed assessment with respect to such Excise Tax (a  Proposed Assessment ). Executive agrees not to settle any Proposed Assessment without the consent of Franklin.  If Franklin does not consent to allow Executive to settle the Proposed Assessment, within 30 days following such demand therefor, Franklin shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive with respect to any additional taxes, interest and/or penalties that Executive is required to pay by reason of the delay in finally resolving Executive s tax liability (such indemnification to be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive makes such remittance). 
  7.        Indemnification  .    Franklin shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Executive from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys  fees) incurred as a result of Executive s employment with Franklin to the fullest extent permitted by the Indiana Business Corporation Law. 
  
   -6-     

8.        Litigation Expenses  .    Franklin shall reimburse Executive all out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys  fees, incurred by Executive in connection with any enforcement, claim or legal action or proceeding involving this Agreement, whether brought by Executive or by or on behalf of Franklin or by another party.  Such reimbursement shall be made within 30 days of Executive s submission of an invoice following resolution of the claim.  Franklin shall pay prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by Executive, calculated at the published prime interest rate charged by Franklin s principal banking connection from the date that payment(s) to him should have been made under this Agreement. 
  9.        Post-Termination Payment Obligations  .    Subject to Section 4,     Franklin's obligation to pay Executive the compensation and to make the other arrangements provided herein to be paid and made after termination of Executive's employment with Franklin shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that Franklin may have against him or anyone else.  All amounts so payable by Franklin shall be paid without notice or demand.  Each and every such payment made by Franklin shall be final and Franklin will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from Executive or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reason whatsoever. 
  10.        Disclosure Of Confidential Information  .  Without the consent of Franklin, Executive shall not at any time divulge, furnish or make accessible to anyone (other than in the regular course of business of Franklin) any knowledge or information with respect to confidential or secret processes, inventions, formulae, machinery, plan, devices or materials of Franklin or with respect to any confidential or secret engineering development or research work of Franklin or with respect to any other confidential or secret aspect of the business of Franklin.  Executive recognizes that irreparable injury will result to Franklin and its business and properties, in the event of any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section 10.  In the event of any breach of any of the commitments of Executive pursuant to this Section 10, Franklin shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies and damages available, to injunctive relief to restrain the violation of such commitments by Executive or by any person or persons acting for or with Executive in any capacity whatsoever. 
  11.        Solicitation Of Employees  .  During Executive s employment with Franklin and for a period of 18 months after termination of employment, Executive shall not (a) directly or indirectly, employ or retain or solicit for employment or arrange to have any other person, firm or other entity employ or retain or solicit for employment or otherwise participate in the employment or retention of any person who is an employee of Franklin or (b) encourage or solicit any such employee to leave the service of Franklin.  Executive also acknowledges and agrees that he shall comply with the terms of the Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement in effect between him and Franklin.  Executive and Franklin agree that of the amount paid to Executive pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement, a portion equal to one times Executive s Base Salary and one times the Target Bonus paid or payable to Executive pursuant to subparagraph 3(c) shall serve as adequate consideration for the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 11. 
  12.        Executive Assignment  .    No interest of Executive or his spouse or any other beneficiary under this Agreement, or any right to receive any payment or distribution hereunder,  
  
   -7-     

shall be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind, nor may such interest or right to receive a payment or distribution be taken, voluntarily or involuntarily, for the satisfaction of the obligations or debts of, or other claims against, Executive or his spouse or other beneficiary, by operation of law or otherwise, other than pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order to which Executive is a party. 
  13.        Reimbursements or In-Kind Benefits  .    Reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are subject to the following restrictions:  (a) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursements, or in-kind benefits provided, to Executive during a calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the in-kind benefits provided in any other calendar year, and (b) reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. 
  14.        Waiver, Modification  .

No waiver by either party at any time of any breach by the other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same time or at any prior or subsequent time.

  16.        Entire Agreement  .

  19.        Employment with an Affiliate  .    If Executive is employed by Franklin and an Affiliate, or solely by an Affiliate, on the date of termination of employment of Executive under circumstances described in Section 2, then (a) employment or termination of employment as used in this Agreement shall mean employment or termination of employment of Executive with Franklin and such Affiliate, or with such Affiliate, as applicable, and related references to Franklin shall also

The Administrative Agent shall notify the US Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.

Each Letter of Credit shall provide that any payments thereunder shall be in Agreed Currencies.

Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at anytime shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time;   provided   that, with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any letter of credit agreement related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such times. 
  (b)        Expiration Date  .  Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the applicable Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit or such later date as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree to in its sole discretion (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any Issuing Bank s sole discretion a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank may have an expiration date up to two years after the Maturity Date, provided that the Borrowers shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the amount available under such Letter of Credit on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. 
  (c)        Participations  .  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative  
  
   35 

Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
  (d)        Reimbursement  .  If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, the Borrower on behalf of which the Letter of Credit was issued shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date such Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if such Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Company, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by such Issuing Bank pursuant such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the US Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the US Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the US Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;   provided   that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than the Dollar Amount of $500,000, the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with   Section 2.03   or   2.05   that such payment be financed with a Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount in such currency and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan, as applicable.  If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in   Section 2.07   with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and   Section 2.07   shall apply,   mutatis     mutandis  , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If any Borrower s reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars would subject the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, such Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement. 
  (e)        Obligations Absolute  .  Each Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be  
  
   36 

performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower s obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of applicable Issuing Bank;   provided   that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
  (f)        Disbursement Procedures  .  The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;   provided   that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  All LC Disbursements shall be made in Agreed Currencies.  
  (g)        Interim Interest  .  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, at the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate for such Agreed Currency plus the then effective Applicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Loans) and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable;   provided   that, if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then   Section 2.13(d)   shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest  
  
   37 

accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
  (h)        Replacement and Resignation of Issuing Bank  .  
  (a)        Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)  .  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
  (b)        Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty days  prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders, in which case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with   Section 2.06(i)(a)   above. 
  (i)        Cash Collateralization  .  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the US Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;   provided   that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars that the Borrowers are not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in the applicable currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of   Article VII  .  For the purposes of this paragraph, the LC Exposure denominated in Agreed Currencies other than Dollars shall be calculated using the applicable Exchange Rate on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the US Borrower.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers  risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any applicable Issuing Bank (ratably in the case of more than one Issuing Bank) for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of  
  
   38 

Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. 
  (j)        Issuing Bank Agreements  . Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) promptly following the end of each calendar month, the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding at the end of such month, (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letter of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not permit any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the amount of any Letter of Credit to occur without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that it is then permitted under this Agreement, (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit, the date of such payment under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such payment, (iv) on any Business Day on which any Borrower fails to reimburse any payment under any Letter of Credit required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such payment and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. 
  SECTION 2.07.         Funding of Borrowings  .    (a)   On the proposed date of each Borrowing, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, if any, (i) if such Loan is denominated in Dollars, not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, in Federal or other funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, in Chicago, Illinois, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, and (ii) if such Loan is denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency in the city of and at the address of the Administrative Agent s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.  Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in   Article IV   has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrowers to an account of the Borrowers maintained with one of the Lenders and designated by the Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request;   provided   that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in   Section 2.06(e)   shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.07  , to the extent that a Loan made by a Lender matures on the same date of a Borrowing hereunder, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of the Loan it is then making to the repayment of principal of the maturing Loan.  Further, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.07  , Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in   Section 2.05  . 
  (a)        Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is  
  
   39 

made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars) or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. 
  SECTION 2.08.         Interest Elections  .    (a)   Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the US Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect the same or different Interest Periods therefor or the same or different Agreed Currency, all as provided in this Section;   provided  ,   however  , that any conversion of any Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  The US Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. 
  (a)        To make an election pursuant to this Section, the US Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election (by telephone or irrevocable written notice in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars or by irrevocable written notice (via an Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the US Borrower) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under   Section 2.03   if the Borrowers were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the US Borrower. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit any Borrower to (i) change the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with   Section 2.02(d)   or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under such Borrowing.  
  (b)        Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with   Section 2.02  : 
  (i)        the applicable Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); 
  (ii)        the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; 
  (iii)        whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and 
  
   40 

(iv)        if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Agreed Currency to be applicable thereto and the Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term  Interest Period . 
  If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. 
  (c)        Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
  (d)        If the US Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars in respect of which the US Borrower shall have failed to deliver an Interest Election Request prior to the third (3   rd   ) Business Day preceding the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with   Section 2.11  .  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the US Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall automatically be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month. 
  SECTION 2.09.         Termination and Reduction of Commitments  .    (a)   Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. 
  (a)        The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;   provided   that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars) and (ii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with   Section 2.11  , the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed the total Commitments. 
  (b)        The US Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the US Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;   provided   that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the US Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the US Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. 
  
   41 

SECTION 2.10.         Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt  .    (a)   The US Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made. 
  (a)        The Dutch Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to the Dutch Borrower on the Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan made to the Dutch Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made to the Dutch Borrower on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made. 
  (b)        On each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the applicable Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans made to such Borrower then outstanding.  
  (c)        Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Debt of each of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
  (d)        The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and, if applicable, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each of the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. 
  (e)        The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section shall be   prima     facie   evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;   provided   that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
  (f)        Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to   Section 9.04  ) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 
  SECTION 2.11.         Prepayment of Loans  .    (a)   Subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section, the Borrowers may from time to time prepay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding ABR Borrowings, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000, any portion of the outstanding ABR Borrowings, and may from time to time prepay, subject to the payment of any break funding amounts required by   Section 2.16   but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowings,  
  
   42 

or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowings.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrowers shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.  
  (a)        The US Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment, or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date of prepayment.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by   Section 2.13   and (ii) break funding payments pursuant to   Section 2.16  .

  the Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately repay Borrowings or cash collateralize LC Exposure in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to   Section 2.06(j)  , as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to cause (1) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal

Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in Dollars in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;   provided   that any Facility Fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of calculating the Facility Fee hereunder, the principal amount of each Borrowing made in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall be at any time the Dollar Amount of such Borrowing as determined on the most recent Computation Date with respect to such Borrowing. 
  (a)        The US Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily Dollar Amount of such Lender s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender s Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in the applicable Agreed Currency on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;   provided   that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b)        The US Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the US Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 
  (c)        All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to an Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of Facility Fees and participation fees, to the Lenders.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 
  SECTION 2.13.         Interest  .    (a)   The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Margin (or, in the case of any Swingline Loan, such other rate as agreed between the applicable Borrower and the Swingline Lender). 
  (a)        The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, at the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, or (ii) in the case of a Competitive Loan that is a Eurocurrency Loan, at the Eurocurrency Reference Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable to such Loan. 
  (b)        Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Fixed Rate. 
  (c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the US Borrower declare that (i) each Eurocurrency Loan shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum,   provided   that, during the continuance of an Event of Default under   Section 7.01(h)   or   (i)  , the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Loans without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
  (d)        Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments;   provided   that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
  
   45 

(e)        All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days (except that interest (i) computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) for Borrowings denominated in British pounds sterling, Australian Dollars or Canadian Dollars shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days) and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.   
  SECTION 2.14.         Alternate Rate of Interest  .   
  (a)        If at the time that the Administrative Agent shall seek to determine the applicable Screen Rate on the Quotation Day for any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing such Screen Rate shall not be available for such Interest Period and/or for the applicable currency with respect to such Eurocurrency Borrowing for any reason, and the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine that it is not possible to determine the Interpolated Rate (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), then if (i) such Borrowing shall be requested in Dollars, then such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate and (ii) such Borrowing shall be requested in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then the applicable Screen Rate shall be equal to the rate determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion after consultation with the Company and consented to in writing by the Required Lenders (the    Alternative Rate      provided   that, until such time as the Alternative Rate shall be determined and so consented to by the Required Lenders, Borrowings shall not be available in such Agreed Currency. 
  (b)        If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing: 
  (i)        the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means (including, without limitation, by means of an Interpolated Rate) do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Reference Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for a Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period; or 
  (ii)        the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or in the case of a Competitive Loan that is a Eurocurrency Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the Eurocurrency Reference Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for such Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period or the applicable Agreed Currency; 
  then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the US Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the US Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then the Screen Rate for such  
  
   46 

Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be the Alternative Rate;   provided   that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted. 
  SECTION 2.15.         Increased Costs  .    (a)   If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity, compulsory loan, insurance charge or other assessment, liquidity or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate) or any Issuing Bank; 
  (ii)        impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or 
  (iii)        subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other recipient of any payments to be made by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Excluded Taxes or (C) Other Taxes); 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Person of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Person of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Person hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the US Borrower will pay to such Person such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Person for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the US Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)        A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the US Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The US Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)        Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the US Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than  
  
   47 

90 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the US Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor;   provided     further   that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made. 
  SECTION 2.16.         Break Funding Payments  .  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to   Section 2.11  ), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under   Section 2.11(b)   and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to   Section 2.19  , then, in any such event, the US Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the US Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
  SECTION 2.17.         Taxes  .    (a)   Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;   provided   that if the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or any Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
  (a)        In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
  
   48 

(b)        The US Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the US Borrower by a Lender, or any Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (c)        As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the US Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  (d)        Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrowers are located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the US Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. 
  (e)        If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the US Borrower or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.17  , it shall pay over such refund to the US Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the US Borrower under this   Section 2.17   with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);   provided  , that the US Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person. 
  (f)        Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the US Borrower to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such amounts were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this   Section 2.17(g)   shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.  Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. 
  
   49 

(g)        If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the US Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(h),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
  (h)        For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the Effective Date, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). 
  SECTION 2.18.         Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs  .   
      (a)     (i)    Each Loan shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such Loan was made.  The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under   Section 2.15  ,   2.16   or   2.17  , or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7   th    Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to   Sections 2.15  ,   2.16  ,   2.17   and   9.03   shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto, and except that all payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in any currency other than Dollars shall be made in such currency on the date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency for the account of the Administrative Agent, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at, (a) with respect to ABR Loans and Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, its address specified in the Administrative Questionnaire or at any address specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender and (b) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, in the funds received from the applicable Borrower at the address of the Administrative Agent s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge any account of any Borrower maintained with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its Affiliates for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. 
  
   50 

(i)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which such Credit Event was made (the    Original Currency   ) no longer exists or the US Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. 
  (b)        If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
  (c)        If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;   provided   that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by either Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
  (d)        Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the US Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the  
  
   51 

Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars). 
  (e)        If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to   Section 2.05(c)  ,   2.06(d)   or   (e)  ,   2.07(b)  ,   2.18(d)   or   9.03(c)  , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender s obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
  SECTION 2.19.         Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  .    (a)   If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15  , or if either of the Borrowers is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.15   or   2.17  , as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The US Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  
  (a)        If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15  , or if either of the Borrowers is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in   Section 9.04  ), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to   Sections 2.15   or   2.17  ) and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that (i) the US Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.15   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.17  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  SECTION 2.20.         Market Disruption  .  Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in   Article II   and   Article IV   with respect to any Borrowing in any Agreed Currency other than  
  
   52 

Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Borrowing any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Loans comprising such Borrowing to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrowers, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the US Borrower and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in   Section 2.03(b)  , be made on the proposed date of such Borrowing in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be, as ABR Loans, unless the US Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be. 
  SECTION 2.21.         Judgment Currency  .  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from either of the Borrowers hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the    specified currency   ) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent s main office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non appealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under   Section 2.18(c)  , such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower. 
  SECTION 2.22.         Defaulting Lenders  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
  (a)        fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 2.12(a)  ; 
  (b)        the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to   Section 9.02  );   provided  , that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the  
  
   53 

case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby; 
  (c)        if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
  (i)        all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure referred to in clause (b) of the definition of such term) shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Commitments and (y) that such reallocation does not, as to any non-Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed its Commitment; 
  (ii)        if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the US Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)   first  , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y)   second  , cash collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only the Borrowers  obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in   Section 2.06(j)   for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
  (iii)        if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)   with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; 
  (iv)        if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)   shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders  Applicable Percentages; and 
  (v)        if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all Facility Fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under   Section 2.12(b)   with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure shall be payable ratably to the applicable Issuing Banks until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 
  (d)        so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Banks shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender s then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the US Borrower in accordance with   Section 2.22(c)  , and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly  
  
   54 

issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with   Section 2.22(c)(i)   (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein). 
  If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. 
  In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers, the Swingline Lender and each of the Issuing Banks each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

  ARTICLE VIII              The Administrative Agent 
  SECTION 8.01.         The Administrative Agent  .    (a)   Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks), and no Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  agent  as used herein or in any other Loan Document (or any similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. 
  (a)        The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. 
  (b)        The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in   Section 9.02  ), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage  
  
   71 

of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in   Section 9.02  ) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by any Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in   Article IV   or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
  (c)        The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  (d)        The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 
  (e)        Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the US Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent,   provided   that such appointment shall be in consultation with the Borrowers if such successor is one of the Lenders and shall be subject to the approval of the Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such successor is not one of the Lenders.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and   Section 9.03   shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 
  
   72 

(f)        Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and letters of credit and not investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Company and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder. 
  (g)        None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph. 
  The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or any Electronic System.

  SECTION 9.02.         Waivers; Amendments  .    (a)   No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrowers therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
  (a)        Except with respect to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;   provided   that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby (except that any amendment or modification of the financial covenants in this Agreement (or defined terms used in the financial covenants  
  
   75 

in this Agreement) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (ii)), (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change   Section 2.18(b)   or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of  Required Lenders  or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by   Section 2.01(b)   to be parties to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date) or (vi) release the Company from the obligations under   Article X   or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender;   provided     further   that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be (it being understood that any change to   Section 2.22   shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender); provided further, that no such agreement shall amend or modify the provisions of   Section 2.06   or any letter of credit application and any bilateral agreement between the Company and any Issuing Bank regarding such Issuing Bank s Letter of Credit Commitment or the respective rights and obligations between the Company and such Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the such Issuing Bank, respectively, or except as set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit Commitment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification.

(a)   The US Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of pocket expenses incurred during  any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit. 
  (a)        The US Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an    Indemnitee   ) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for  
  
   76 

any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by either of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to either of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by either of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective equity holders, Affiliates or creditors and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;   provided   that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This   Section 9.03(b)   shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
  (b)        To the extent that the US Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the US Borrower s failure to pay any such amount shall not relieve the US Borrower of any default in the payment thereof);   provided   that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. 
  (c)        To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall  assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
  (d)        All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days after written demand therefor. 
  SECTION 9.04.         Successors and Assigns  .    (a)   The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by such Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related  
  
   77

  (A)        the Borrowers (  provided   that the Borrowers shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless they shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof),   provided  ,   further   that no consent of the Borrowers shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee (except in the case of an assignment to a competitor of the Borrowers in which case the consent of the Borrowers shall still be required); 
  (B)        the Administrative Agent,  
  (C)        the Issuing Banks, and 
  (D)        the Swingline Lender. 
  (ii)        Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
  (A)        except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,   provided   that no such consent of the Borrowers shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  (B)        each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement,   provided   that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans; 
  (C)        the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (x) an Assignment and Assumption or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, such fee to be paid by either the assigning Lender or the assignee Lender or shared between such Lenders; and 
  
   78 

(D)        the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a completed Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrowers and their affiliates and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws. 
  For the purposes of this   Section 9.04(b)  , the terms    Approved Fund    and    Ineligible Institution    have the following meanings: 
     Approved Fund    means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

  (iii)        Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.15  ,   2.16  ,   2.17   and   9.03  ).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this   Section 9.04   shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
  (iv)        The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, any Issuing Bank, and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  (v)        Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, the assignee s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee  
  
   79 

referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register;   provided   that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to   Section 2.05(c)  ,   2.06(d)   or   (e)  ,   2.07(b)  , 2  .18(d)   or   9.03(c)  , the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
  (b)        (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a    Participant   ), other than an Ineligible Institution, in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to   Section 9.02(b)   that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.15  ,   2.16   and   2.17   to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 9.08   as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.18(c)   as though it were a Lender. 
  (i)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 2.15   or   2.17   than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation and the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers  prior written consent (which consent shall expressly set forth such right to greater payment).  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 2.17   unless the US Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with   Section 2.17(e)   as though it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under   Section 2.17(e)   shall be delivered to the participating Lender).  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the obligations under this Agreement (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in the obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such interest is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  
   80 

(c)        Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

  ARTICLE X              US Borrower Guaranty 
  
   86 

SECTION 10.01.         US Borrower Guaranty  .    (a)   In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Dutch Borrower hereunder, the US Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Dutch Borrower s obligations hereunder and the Specified Ancillary Obligations (collectively, the    Guaranteed Obligations   ). The US Borrower further agrees that the due and punctual payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Guaranteed Obligation.  The US Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank and the Lenders immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability they incur as a result of any other Loan Party or a Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by the US Borrower under this   Article X   on the date when it would have been due (but so that the amount payable by the US Borrower under this indemnity will not exceed the amount which it would have had to pay under this   Article X   if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee). 
  (a)        The US Borrower waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of the US Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the obligations hereunder; (e) the failure of the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations, if any; (f) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of the US Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (g) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the US Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason related this Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction purporting to prohibit the payment by the US Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (h) any other act (other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations), omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the US Borrower or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the US Borrower to subrogation. 
  (b)        The US Borrower further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.

(c)        The obligations of the US Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations), and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, including, without limitation, any defenses that may exist under the provisions of the Illinois Sureties Act or any similar statutes (all of which defenses are hereby waived). 
  (d)        The US Borrower further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall constitute a continuing and irrevocable guarantee of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff) is rescinded, or is or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a holder of the Guaranteed Obligations in its discretion). 
  (e)        In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the US Borrower by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Dutch Borrower to pay any obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the US Borrower hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the Guaranteed Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The US Borrower further agrees that if payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York, Chicago or any other Eurocurrency Payment Office and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender in any material respect, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the US Borrower shall make payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Equivalent Amount in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, Chicago or such other Eurocurrency Payment Office as is designated by the Administrative Agent and, as a separate and independent obligation, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. 
  (f)        Upon payment by the US Borrower of any sums as provided above, all rights of the US Borrower against the Dutch Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations owed by the Dutch Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders. 
  (g)        Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the US Borrower hereunder except the full performance and payment in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
  (h)        The US Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this   Section 10.01   or the Guaranty, as applicable, in respect of Specified Swap Obligations (  provided  , however, that the US Borrower shall only be liable under this paragraph for the  
  
   88 

maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this paragraph or otherwise under this   Section 10.01   voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The US Borrower intends that this paragraph constitute, and this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute, a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of each other Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
  (i)        The US Borrower agrees that it is not a surety for purposes of the Illinois Sureties Act or any similar statutes.  The US Borrower waives any right that it may have under the Illinois Sureties Act or any similar statutes to assert the applicability thereof to the provisions of this Agreement to require that the Administrative Agent commence action against any Borrower or any other person or against any of the collateral.
