AGRITEK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

Note 1 -  Organization   

Business   

Agritek Holdings, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Agritek ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Agritek Venture Holdings, Inc. ( AVHI ), acquires and leases
real estate to licensed marijuana operators, including providing complete turnkey growing space and related facilities to
licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners. Additionally, the Company offers a variety of services and product lines
to the medicinal marijuana sector including the distribution of hemp based nutritional products and a line of innovative solutions
for electronically processing merchant transactions. 

On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a certificate
of amendment (a  Certificate of Amendment ), increasing the authorized capital of the Company to 1,001,000,000 shares
of capital stock; consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock par value $0.0001 and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.01. The majority of the Company s shareholders consented to the Certificate of Amendment increasing the authorized
capital. 

Note 2    Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation and Principles
of Consolidation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included
in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Interim results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full
year. Certain amounts from the 2015 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements of the Company  include the consolidated accounts of Agritek and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, AVHI and Prohibition Products, Inc. ( PPI ). PPI, a Florida corporation, was originally formed on July
1, 2013 as The American Hemp Trading Company, Inc. ( AHTC ) and on August 27, 2014, AHTC changed its name to PPI. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company records accounts receivable from
amounts due from its customers upon the shipment of products. The allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses
charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely.
The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based
on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience. While management uses the best information available
to make its evaluations, this estimate is susceptible to significant change in the near term. As of September 30, 2016, based on
the above criteria, the Company has a full allowance for doubtful accounts of $43,408. 

Inventory   

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
market value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving
inventory is made based on management analysis or inventory levels and future sales forecasts. 

Deferred Financing Costs   

The costs related to the issuance of debt are
capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method through the maturities of the related debt. 

Derivative Financial Instruments   

The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments, including
stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at
its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

For option-based simple derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount   

The Company may record debt issue costs and/or
debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt.  These costs may be paid in the form of
cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of
the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

Original Issue Discount   

For certain convertible debt issued, the Company
may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount.  The original issue discount would be recorded to debt discount,
reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. 

Marketable Securities   

The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
in the period earned or incurred. 

Investment of Non-Marketable Securities   

The Company s investment in non-marketable
securities consist of cash investments in a less than 10% interest in two privately held companies that provide merchant processing
services. Petrogress, Inc. (formerly 800 Commerce, Inc. and a subsidiary of the Company through its  deconsolidation in May
2012) derived substantially all of its  revenues, through April 2015, from these privately held companies. 

Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
and except for land, depreciation is provided by use of a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
Company reviews property and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts of assets may not be recoverable. In November 2015, the Company was made aware that the land transaction regarding 80 acres
in Pueblo County, Colorado, may not have been properly deeded to the Company. The company was a party to the land purchase,
however, it was recently discovered, and the second party to the land contract never filed the original quit claim deed on behalf
of the Company, even though a copy of the notarized quit claim deed was sent to the Company. To date, the Company has paid a total
of $47,438 ($36,000 at closing) and is on the deed of trust of the property with a remaining note balance of approximately $75,000
held by the original owner. Accordingly, until the deed is properly recorded, the Company reduced the remaining balance of the
note payable for the acquisition of the land of $74,313 and recorded a reserve allowance for the remaining balance of the asset
of $54,490. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:  

Furniture and equipment  
      5 years   

The Company's property and equipment consisted
of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Depreciation expense of $1,173 and $2,625 was
recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $692 and $2,075 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets   

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on events and
changes in circumstances in the nine months ending September 30, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying amount of goodwill initially
recorded from an acquisition in September 2014, and determined that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and accordingly
recognized an impairment loss of $192,849 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the month in which products are shipped or commissions are earned. No revenue has
been recognized from leasing arrangements to date. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined under
a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). 

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers
the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity
to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed in
the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term
maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.  The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative
of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects,
calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax
asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. Interest
and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor paid,
any interest or penalties. 

Uncertain tax positions are measured and recorded
by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized
or continue to be recognized. The Company s tax years subsequent to 2005 remain subject to examination by federal and state
tax jurisdictions. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share are computed in accordance
with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss), after
deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities, if any, outstanding during the period. As of September
30, 2016 there were warrants and options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock and the Company s outstanding convertible
debt is convertible into approximately 485,848,122 shares of common stock. These amounts are not included in the computation of
dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation    

The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded stock and warrant based compensation of $0 and $2,371, respectively compared to $94,370 and $551,475
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. (See Note 8). 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Advertising   

The Company records advertising costs as incurred.
For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016, advertising expense was $321 and $6,321, respectively, compared to $25,756
and $63,510 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Note 3    Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

Note 4    Impairment of Goodwill   

On September 12, 2014,
the Company completed the asset acquisition of the entire line of products, technology and customers of Dry Vapes Holdings,
Inc. 

The Company recorded the acquisition using
the acquisition method, which requires the Company to record the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (if any) at their acquisition
date fair values and record any excess of the consideration given, including liabilities assumed (if any) over the fair value of
the assets acquired as goodwill. The acquired assets consisted solely of inventory. The transaction resulted in the Company recording
goodwill of $192,849. Based on events and changes in circumstances in the nine months ending September 30, 2015, the Company reviewed
the carrying amount of the goodwill, and determined that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and accordingly recognized
an impairment loss of $192,849 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Note 5    Sales Concentration and
Concentration of Credit Risk   

Cash   

Financial   instruments   that   potentially   subject   the   Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains cash balances at one financial institution,
which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The FDIC insured institution insures
up to $250,000 on account balances. 

Sales and Accounts Receivable   

Following is a summary of customers who accounted
for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company s revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the accounts
receivable balance as of September 30, 2016: 

Purchases   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
the Company s purchases were from one vendor. 

Note 6    Convertible Debt and Note
Payable   

2014 Convertible Note   

In January 2014, the Company entered into a
Secured Promissory Note for $1,660,000 (the  2014 Company Note ) to Tonaquint, Inc. ( Tonaquint ) which
includes a purchase price of $1,500,000 and transaction costs of $160,000. On January 31, 2014, the Company received $300,000 of
the purchase price. Tonaquint also issued to the Company 6 secured promissory notes, each in the amount of $200,000 (the 2014  Investor

The debt issuance costs included in the 2015
Convertible Notes were amortized over the earlier of the terms of the Note or any redemptions and have been expensed as debt issuance
costs (included in interest expense). 

Among other terms the 2015 Notes are due nine
to twelve months from their issuance date, bearing interest at 8% per annum, payable in cash or shares at a conversion price (the
 Conversion Price ) for each share of common stock equal to 39% - 42% of the average of the lowest three trading prices
(as defined in the note agreements) per share of the Company s common stock for the ten to eighteen trading days immediately
preceding the date of conversion. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, as defined in the 2015 Convertible Notes, the Company
was required to pay interest at 22% per annum and the holders could at their option declare a Note, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the 2015 Convertible Notes provide for adjustments for dividends payable
other than in shares of common stock, for reclassification, exchange or substitution of the common stock for another security or
securities of the Company or pursuant to a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets, where there is a change in
control of the Company. 

The Company determined that the conversion
feature of the 2015 Convertible Notes represent an embedded derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of
shares upon conversion. Accordingly, the 2015 Convertible Notes were not considered to be conventional debt under ASC 815-40 (formerly
EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company s Own Stock)
and the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly,
the fair value of these derivative instruments being recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding
amount recorded as a discount to each Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of
the Notes. The change in the fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet.
The embedded feature included in the 2015 Convertible Notes resulted in an initial debt discount of $211,750, an initial derivative
liability expense of $71,761 and an initial derivative liability of $283,511.

debentures is due and payable one year from their respective funding date, and the LG and Cerebrus Debentures are convertible into
shares of the Company s common stock at any time at the discretion of LG and Cerebrus, respectively, at a VCP. The VCP is
calculated as the lowest trading price during the eighteen (18) trading days immediately prior to the conversion date multiplied

by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 148% on the 180 th  day from issuance. Beginning on the 180 th  day
after the issuance of the Debentures, the Company is not permitted to prepay the Debenture, so long as the Debenture is still outstanding,
unless the Company and the holder agree otherwise in writing.

of approximately $2,400 annually. The Company paid the $50,000 in July 2014, and has not used the property and any water and has
not paid for any water rights after September 30, 2015. The Company has recorded $32,850 and $34,933 and $98,550 and $125,633 of
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, (included in leased property expenses).
The Company is currently in default of the lease agreement, as rents have not been paid since February 2015.  

Legal  
Other   

On May 6, 2016, the
Company, B. Michael Freidman and Barry Hollander (former CFO) were named as defendants in a Summons/Complaint filed by Justin Braune
in Palm Beach County Civil Court, Florida. The complaint alleges that Mr. Braune is entitled to 27,500,000 shares of common stock
of the Company. The defendants will defend this lawsuit as Mr. Braune sent an email to the Company and the Company s transfer
agent cancelling 12,500,000 shares on October 16, 2015 and his letter of resignation dated November 4, 2015, clearly stated that
he confirmed he had cancelled 15,000,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Braune s letter of resignation was filed as Exhibit
5.1 on Form 8-K with the SEC on November 9, 2015. 

Note 10    Going Concern    

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had an
accumulated deficit of $16,642,564   and working capital deficit of $3,741,640, inclusive of a derivative
liability of $2,808,648. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Note 11    Segment Reporting

St. George Investments, LLC.   

On October 31, 2016, the Company entered into
a Convertible Promissory Note ( St. George 2016 Notes ) for $555,000 to St. George Investments, LLC., ( St. George )
which includes a purchase price of $500,000 and transaction costs of $5,000 and OID interest of $50,000. On October 31, 2016, the

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following is management s discussion
and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management.
This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words  believes,   anticipates,   may, 
 will,   should,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   continue, 
and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports
or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes
to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The independent auditor s report on our
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph
that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to the factors
prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note 10 to the unaudited condensed financial statements. 

While our financial statements are presented
on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern.

months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The 2015 amount is comprised of the amortization of restricted common stock issued
to our CEO. 

Stock compensation expense, other (included
in professional and consulting fees) was $0 and $0, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared

$100,000 as stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company also agreed the advisor shall
receive a non-qualified stock option to purchase 1,000,000 shares ( Option Shares ) of the Company s common stock
at an exercise price equal to $0.05 per share. Accordingly, the Company recorded $2,371 and $8,694 as stock compensation expense

Capital
Resources and Liquidity   

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to
generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $7,540, a decrease of $4,008, from $11,548 as of December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had current liabilities of $3,776,721
(including $2,808,648 of non-cash derivative liabilities) compared to current assets of $35,801 which resulted in working capital
deficit of $3,741,640. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible debt, derivative
liabilities and notes payable. 

Operating Activities  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net cash used in operating activities was $250,139 compared to $445,561 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company had a net loss for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 of $3,195,683 offset by a gain on debt settlements of $84,057 which were impacted by non-cash expenses

We do not have cash and cash equivalents on
hand to meet our obligations. We presently maintain our daily operations and capital needs through the sale of our products and
financings available to us from lenders. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016, a net loss and net cash
used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting to produce sufficient
revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances
to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its
business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We have identified the following policies below
as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting
policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve making estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations.
For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and the best estimates routinely
require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. 

Basis of Presentation and Principles
of Consolidation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included
in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Interim results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full
year. Certain amounts from the 2015 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements of the Company  include the consolidated accounts of Agritek and its wholly owned
subsidiaries AVHI and Prohibition Products, Inc. ( PPI ). PPI, a Florida corporation, was originally formed on July
1, 2013 as The American Hemp Trading Company, Inc. ( AHTC ) and on August 27, 2014, AHTC changed its name to PPI. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company records accounts receivable from
amounts due from its customers upon the shipment of products. The allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses
charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely.
The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based
on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience. While management uses the best information available
to make its evaluations, this estimate is susceptible to significant change in the near term. As of September 30, 2016, based on
the above criteria, the Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $44,068. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the month in which products are shipped or commissions are earned. No revenue has
been recognized from leasing arrangements to date. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined under
a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). 

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers
the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity
to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed in
the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term
maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.  The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative
of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share are computed in accordance
with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss), after
deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities, if any, outstanding during the period. As of September
30, 2016 there were warrants and options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock and the Company s outstanding convertible
debt is convertible into approximately 485,848,122 shares of common stock These amounts are not included in the computation of
dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive. 

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation   

The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have
additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size
and operations of the Company, we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
AGRITEK HOLDINGS, Inc. (the  Company ) promises to pay to the order of LG CAPITAL FUNDING, LLC and its authorized
successors and permitted assigns (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of Sixty Five Thousand Six Hundred
Twenty Five Dollars exactly (U.S. $65,625.00) on April 15, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and to pay interest on the
principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on April 15, 2016. The interest will be paid to
the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note.
The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1218 Union Street, Suite #2, Brooklyn, NY 11225, initially, and if
changed, last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The Company
will pay each interest payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note on the Maturity Date, less any amounts required
by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address
appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding
principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum represented
by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is
exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall
pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. 

2. The Company
shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3. This Note may
be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ) and applicable
state securities laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due
presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is
duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and
neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing
to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a),
and any prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being
converted (  Notice of Conversion  ) in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 

4. (a) The Holder
of this Note is entitled, at its option, after full cash payment for the shares convertible hereunder,   to convert all or
any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common
Stock  ), at a price (  Conversion Price  ) for each share of Common Stock equal to 58% of the   lowest
closing bid price   of the Common Stock as reported on the OTCQB maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. upon which the
Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ),
for the    eighteen      prior   trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is
received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method
of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes
to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion
may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within
3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion.
No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable
shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes
below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce
the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.
 In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 48%
instead of 58% while that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion
if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would
exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 

(b) Interest on
any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in
Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest
Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a
portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 

(c) The
Notes may be prepaid with the following penalties: 

This Note may not
be prepaid after the 180 th  day. Such redemption must be closed and funded within 3 days of giving notice of redemption
of the right to redeem shall be null and void. 

(d)  Upon (i) a
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
(ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or (iii)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity
(other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification,
conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem
this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the
election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued
but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)  In case of
any Sale Event in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to
be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this
Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification,
capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could
have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to
such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received by the
holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor
person or entity acting in good faith. 

5. No provision
of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of,
and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6. The Company
hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor,
notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder and
shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto. 

7. The Company
agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder in
collecting any amount due under this Note. 

8. If one or more
of the following described  Events of Default  shall occur: 

(a) The Company
shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company; or 

(b) Any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements heretofore
or hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Note, or the Securities
Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any material respect; or 

(c) The Company
shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of the Company
under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or 

(d) The Company
shall (1) become insolvent; (2) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment
for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee,
liquidator or receiver for its or for a substantial part of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy relief,
consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal
or state laws as applicable; or 

(e) A trustee,
liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial part of its property or business without its consent
and shall not be discharged within thirty (30) days after such appointment; or 

(f) Any governmental
agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of any governmental agency shall assume custody or control of the
whole or any substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or 

(g) One or more
money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the aggregate,
shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid, unvacated, unbonded
or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of any proposed sale
thereunder; or 

(h) defaulted on
or breached any term of any other note of similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and failed to cure such default
within the appropriate grace period; or 

(i) The Company
shall have its Common Stock delisted from a trading market (including the OTC BB market) or, if the Common Stock trades on an
exchange, then trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases to file its 1934 act
reports with the SEC; 

(j) If a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof are no longer serving as members of the Board;

shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3 business days
of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion; or 

(l)  The Company
shall not replenish the reserve set forth in Section 12, within 3 business days of the request of the Holder. 

(m) The Company
shall not be  current  in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or 

(n)  The Company shall lose
the  bid  price for its stock in a market (including the OTCQB marketplace or other exchange). 

Then, or at any time thereafter, unless
cured within 5 days, and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing by the Holder
(which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice
of any kind (other than notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in any note or other
instruments contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any period of
grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law.
Upon an Event of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not
permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section 8(k) the
penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered
to the Company. This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th  day. The penalty for a breach of
Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the outstanding
principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under
this Note shall increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing after the 6 month anniversary of
the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price
for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion
discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note is not paid at maturity,
the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. 

If the Holder shall
commence an action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney,
then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other
costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

Make-Whole for Failure
to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares
by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a Failure

in respect of the Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: 

Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion shares)] 

The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver
Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time of the Holder s written
notice to the Company. 

9. In case any
provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and
the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

10. Neither this
Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the Company
and the Holder. 

11. The Company
represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has not been a  shell  issuer for the 12 months following
the Company  having reported Form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. 

12. The Company
shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 85,393,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under this
Note (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any shares remaining in the Share Reserve shall be
cancelled. The Company shall pay all transfer agent costs associated with issuing and delivering the share certificates to Holder.
If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. The company should at all
times reserve a minimum of four times the amount of shares required if the note would be fully converted.  The Holder may
reasonably request increases from time to time to reserve such amounts. The Company will instruct its transfer agent to provide
the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its conversions. 

13. The Company
will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations
etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 

14. This Note shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed within
the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby
mutually waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York or in the
Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile transmission
of an executed counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this
Note to be duly executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is
exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall

or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if the Holder prevails
in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses incurred
in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.

Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time of the Holder s written
notice to the Company. 

9. In case any
provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and
the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

successors and permitted assigns (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face amount of Twenty Two Thousand Dollars
(U.S. $22,000.00) on March 23, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and to pay interest on the principal amount outstanding
hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on March 23, 2016. The interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this
Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note. The principal of, and interest
on, this Note are payable at 1218 Union Street, Suite #2, Brooklyn, NY 11225, initially, and if changed, last appearing on the
records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment
and the outstanding principal due upon this Note on the Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld,
to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing on the records of
the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall
satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum represented by such check or wire transfer.
Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. 

This Note is subject
to the following additional provisions: 

1. This Note is
exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall
pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. 

2. The Company
shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 

3. This Note may
be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ) and applicable
state securities laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due
presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is
duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and
neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing
to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a),
and any prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being
converted (  Notice of Conversion  ) in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 

4. (a) The Holder
of this Note is entitled, at its option, after full cash payment for the shares convertible hereunder,   to convert all or
any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the   Common
Stock  ), at a price (  Conversion Price  ) for each share of Common Stock equal to 58% of the   lowest
closing bid price   of the Common Stock as reported on the OTCQB maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. upon which the
Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future (  Exchange  ),
for the    eighteen      prior   trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is
received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method
of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes
to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion
may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within
3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion.
No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable
shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes
below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce
the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.
 In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 48%
instead of 58% while that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion
if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would
exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 

(b) Interest on
any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in
Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest
Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a
portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 

(c) This Note may
not be prepaid, except that if the $22,000 Rule 144 convertible redeemable note issued by the Company of even date herewith is
redeemed by the Company within 6 months of the issuance date of such Note, all obligations of the Company under this Note and
all obligations of the Holder under the Holder Issued Note will each be automatically be deemed satisfied and this Note and the
Holder Issued Note will be automatically be deemed cancelled and of no further force or effect. 

(d)  Upon (i) a
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
(ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or (iii)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity
(other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification,
conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem
this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the
election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued
but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)  In case of
any Sale Event in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to
be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this
Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification,
capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could
have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to
such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received by the
holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor
person or entity acting in good faith. 

5. No provision
of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of,
and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6. The Company
hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor,

collecting any amount due under this Note.

Expense Amount  ), all of which amount is included in the initial principal balance of this Note. The purchase price for
this Note and the Warrants (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) shall be $500,000.00 (the   Purchase Price  ),
computed as follows: $555,000.00 original principal balance, less the OID, less the Transaction Expense Amount. The Purchase Price
shall be payable by delivery to Borrower at Closing of the Investor Notes (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and a wire transfer
of immediately available funds in the amount of the Initial Cash Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). This Note
shall be comprised of nine (9) tranches (each, a   Tranche  ), consisting of (i) an initial Tranche in an amount
equal to $115,000.00 and any interest, costs, fees or charges accrued thereon or added thereto under the terms of this Note and
the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (the   Initial   Tranche  ), and (ii)
eight (8) additional Tranches, each in the amount of $55,000.00, plus any interest, costs, fees or charges accrued thereon or added
thereto under the terms of this Note and the other Transaction Documents (each, a   Subsequent Tranche  ). The
Initial Tranche shall correspond to the Initial Cash Purchase Price, the OID and the Transaction Expense Amount, and may be converted
into shares of Common Stock (as defined below) any time subsequent to the Purchase Price Date. The first Subsequent Investor Notethe

 1.  
  Payment; Prepayment . 

 1.1.  
  Payment . Provided there is an Outstanding Balance, on each Installment Date (as defined below), Borrower shall pay
to Lender an amount equal to the Installment Amount (as defined below) due on such Installment Date in accordance with Section 8.
All payments owing hereunder shall be in lawful money of the United States of America or Conversion Shares (as defined below),
as provided for herein, and delivered to Lender at the address or bank account furnished to Borrower for that purpose. All payments
shall be applied first to (a) costs of collection, if any, then to (b) fees and charges, if any, then to (c) accrued and unpaid
interest, and thereafter, to (d) principal. 

 1.2.  
  Prepayment . Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as Borrower has not received a Lender Conversion Notice (as defined
below) or an Installment Notice (as defined below) from Lender where the applicable Conversion Shares have not yet been delivered
and so long as no Event of Default has occurred since the Effective Date (whether declared by Lender or undeclared and regardless
of whether or not cured), then Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than five (5) Trading Days prior written
notice to Lender to prepay the Outstanding Balance of this Note, in full, in accordance with this Section 1. Any notice of prepayment
hereunder (an   Optional Prepayment Notice  ) shall be delivered to Lender at its registered address and shall
state: (i) that Borrower is exercising its right to prepay this Note, and (ii) the date of prepayment, which shall be not less
than five (5) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the   Optional
Prepayment Date  ), Borrower shall make payment of the Optional Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order
of Lender as may be specified by Lender in writing to Borrower. If Borrower exercises its right to prepay this Note, Borrower shall
make payment to Lender of an amount in cash equal to 125% (the   Prepayment Premium  ) multiplied by the then
Outstanding Balance of this Note (the   Optional Prepayment Amount  ). In the event Borrower delivers the Optional
Prepayment Amount to Lender prior to the Optional Prepayment Date or without delivering an Optional Prepayment Notice to Lender
as set forth herein without Lender s prior written consent, the Optional Prepayment Amount shall not be deemed to have been
paid to Lender until the Optional Prepayment Date. Moreover, in such event the Optional Prepayment Liquidated Damages Amount will
automatically be added to the Outstanding Balance of this Note on the day Borrower delivers the Optional Prepayment Amount to Lender.
In the event Borrower delivers the Optional Prepayment Amount without an Optional Prepayment Notice, then the Optional Prepayment
Date will be deemed to be the date that is five (5) Trading Days from the date that the Optional Prepayment Amount was delivered
to Lender and Lender shall be entitled to exercise its conversion rights set forth herein during such five (5) day period. In addition,
if Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to Lender within two (2)
Trading Days following the Optional Prepayment Date, Borrower shall forever forfeit its right to prepay this Note. 

 2.  
  Security . This Note is unsecured. 

 3.  
  Lender Optional Conversion . 

 3.1.  
  Lender Conversions . Lender has the right at any time after the Purchase Price Date until the Outstanding Balance
has been paid in full, including without limitation (a) until any Optional Prepayment Date (even if Lender has received an Optional
Prepayment Notice) or at any time thereafter with respect to any amount that is not prepaid, and (b) during or after any Fundamental
Default Measuring Period, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a   Lender
Conversion  ) all or any part of the Outstanding Balance into shares (  Lender Conversion Shares  ) of
fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (  Common Stock  ), of Borrower as per
the following conversion formula: the number of Lender Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the   Conversion
Amount  ) divided by the Lender Conversion Price (as defined below). Conversion notices in the form attached hereto as
 Exhibit A  (each, a   Lender Conversion Notice  ) may be effectively delivered to Borrower by any method
of Lender s choice (including but not limited to facsimile, email, mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery), and all
Lender Conversions shall be cashless and not require further payment from Lender. Borrower shall deliver the Lender Conversion
Shares from any Lender Conversion to Lender in accordance with Section 9 below. 

 3.2.  
  Lender Conversion Price . Subject to adjustment as set forth in this Note, the price at which Lender has the right
to convert all or any portion of the Outstanding Balance into Common Stock is $0.05 per share of Common Stock (the   Lender
Conversion Price  ). However, in the event the Market Capitalization falls below the Minimum Market Capitalization at
any time, then in such event (a) the Lender Conversion Price for all Lender Conversions occurring after the first date of such
occurrence shall equal the lower of the Lender Conversion Price and the Market Price as of any applicable date of Conversion, and
(b) the true-up provisions of Section 11 below shall apply to all Lender Conversions that occur after the first date the Market
Capitalization falls below the Minimum Market Capitalization, provided that all references to the  Installment Notice 
in Section 11 shall be replaced with references to a  Lender Conversion Notice  for purposes of this Section 3.2, all
references to  Installment Conversion Shares  in Section 11 shall be replaced with references to  Lender Conversion
Shares  for purposes of this Section 3.2, and all references to the  Installment Conversion Price  in Section
11 shall be replaced with references to the  Lender Conversion Price  for purposes of this Section 3.2. 

 3.3.  
  Application to Installments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, including without limitation Section
8 hereof, Lender may, in its sole discretion, apply all or any portion of any Lender Conversion toward any Installment Conversion
(as defined below), even if such Installment Conversion is pending, as determined in Lender s sole discretion, by delivering
written notice of such election (which notice may be included as part of the applicable Lender Conversion Notice) to Borrower at
any date on or prior to the applicable Installment Date. In such event, Borrower may not elect to allocate such portion of the
applicable Installment Amount pursuant to this Section 3.3 in the manner prescribed in Section 8.3; rather, Borrower must reduce
the applicable Installment Amount by the Conversion Amount described in this Section 3.3. 

 4.  
  Defaults and Remedies . 

 4.1.  
  Defaults . The following are events of default under this Note (each, an   Event of Default  ): (a)
Borrower fails to pay any principal, interest, fees, charges, or any other amount when due and payable hereunder; (b) Borrower
fails to deliver any Lender Conversion Shares in accordance with the terms hereof; (c) Borrower fails to deliver any Installment
Conversion Shares (as defined below) or True-Up Shares (as defined below) in accordance with the terms hereof; (d) a receiver,
trustee or other similar official shall be appointed over Borrower or a material part of its assets and such appointment shall
remain uncontested for twenty (20) days or shall not be dismissed or discharged within sixty (60) days; (e) Borrower becomes insolvent
or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, subject to applicable grace
periods, if any; (f) Borrower makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (g) Borrower files a petition for relief
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (domestic or foreign); (h) an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is commenced or
filed against Borrower; (i) Borrower defaults or otherwise fails to observe or perform any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement
of Borrower contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, other than those specifically set forth in this Section 4.1
and Section 4 of the Purchase Agreement; (j) any representation, warranty or other statement made or furnished by or on behalf
of Borrower to Lender herein, in any Transaction Document, or otherwise in connection with the issuance of this Note is false,
incorrect, incomplete or misleading in any material respect when made or furnished; (k) the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction
without Lender s prior written consent; (l) Borrower fails to maintain the Share Reserve as required under the Purchase Agreement;
(m) Borrower effectuates a reverse split of its Common Stock without twenty (20) Trading Days prior written notice to Lender; (n)
any money judgment, writ or similar process is entered or filed against Borrower or any subsidiary of Borrower or any of its property
or other assets for more than $100,000.00, and shall remain unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of twenty (20) calendar
days unless otherwise consented to by Lender; (o) Borrower fails to be DWAC Eligible; (p) Borrower fails to observe or perform
any covenant set forth in Section 4 of the Purchase Agreement, or (q) Borrower breaches any covenant or other term or condition
contained in any Other Agreements. 

 4.2.  
  Remedies . At any time and from time to time after Lender becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default,
Lender may accelerate this Note by written notice to Borrower, with the Outstanding Balance becoming immediately due and payable
in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time following the occurrence of any Event of Default,
Lender may, at its option, elect to increase the Outstanding Balance by applying the Default Effect (subject to the limitation
set forth below) via written notice to Borrower without accelerating the Outstanding Balance, in which event the Outstanding Balance
shall be increased as of the date of the occurrence of the applicable Event of Default pursuant to the Default Effect, but the
Outstanding Balance shall not be immediately due and payable unless so declared by Lender (for the avoidance of doubt, if Lender
elects to apply the Default Effect pursuant to this sentence, it shall reserve the right to declare the Outstanding Balance immediately
due and payable at any time and no such election by Lender shall be deemed to be a waiver of its right to declare the Outstanding
Balance immediately due and payable as set forth herein unless otherwise agreed to by Lender in writing). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in clauses (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of Section 4.1, the Outstanding Balance
as of the date of acceleration shall become immediately and automatically due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount,
without any written notice required by Lender. At any time following the occurrence of any Event of Default, upon written notice
given by Lender to Borrower, interest shall accrue on the Outstanding Balance beginning on the date the applicable Event of Default
occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law (  Default
Interest  );  provided, however , that no Default Interest shall accrue during the Fundamental Default Measuring
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Lender may continue making Lender Conversions at any time following an Event of Default until
such time as the Outstanding Balance is paid in full. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that Lender may continue making
Conversions following the entry of any judgment or arbitration award in favor of Lender until such time that the entire judgment
amount or arbitration award is paid in full. Borrower agrees that any judgment or arbitration award will, by its terms, be made
convertible into Common Stock. Any Conversions made following a judgment or arbitration award shall be made pursuant to the following
formula: the amount of the judgment or arbitration award being converted divided by 80% of the lowest Closing Bid Price in the
ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of Conversion. In such event, Borrower and Lender agree that it is their expectation
that any such judgment amount or arbitration award that is converted will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of
determining the holding period under Rule 144. Borrower and Lender agree and stipulate that any judgment or arbitration award entered
against Borrower shall be reduced by $1,000.00 and such $1,000.00 shall become the new Outstanding Balance of this Note and this
Note shall expressly survive such judgment or arbitration award. Additionally, following the occurrence of any Event of Default,
Borrower may, at its option, pay any Lender Conversion in cash instead of Lender Conversion Shares by paying to Lender on or before
the applicable Delivery Date (as defined below) a cash amount equal to the number of Lender Conversion Shares set forth in the
applicable Lender Conversion Notice multiplied by the highest intra-day trading price of the Common Stock that occurs during the
period beginning on the date the applicable Event of Default occurred and ending on the date of the applicable Lender Conversion
Notice. In connection with acceleration described herein, Lender need not provide, and Borrower hereby waives, any presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and Lender may immediately and without expiration of any grace period enforce any
and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law. Such acceleration may
be rescinded and annulled by Lender at any time prior to payment hereunder and Lender shall have all rights as a holder of the
Note until such time, if any, as Lender receives full payment pursuant to this Section 4.2. No such rescission or annulment shall
affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Nothing herein shall limit Lender s right
to pursue any other remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver Conversion Shares upon Conversion of the Notes
as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

 4.3.  
  Fundamental Default Remedies . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in addition to all other remedies
set forth herein, after giving effect to the Lender Offset Right (as defined below), which shall occur automatically upon the occurrence
of any Fundamental Default, the Fundamental Liquidated Damages Amount shall be added to the Outstanding Balance upon Lender s
delivery to Borrower of a notice (which notice Lender may deliver to Borrower at any time following the occurrence of a Fundamental
Default) setting forth its election to declare a Fundamental Default and the Fundamental Liquidated Damages Amount that will be
added to the Outstanding Balance. 

 4.4.  
  Certain Additional Rights . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event Borrower fails to make any
payment when due or fails to deliver any Conversion Shares as and when required under this Note, then (a) the Lender Conversion
Price for all Lender Conversions occurring after the date of such failure to pay shall equal the lower of the Lender Conversion
Price and the Market Price as of any applicable date of Conversion, and (b) the true-up provisions of Section 11 below shall apply
to all Lender Conversions that occur after the date of such failure to pay, provided that all references to the  Installment
Notice  in Section 11 shall be replaced with references to a  Lender Conversion Notice  for purposes of this
Section 4.4, all references to  Installment Conversion Shares  in Section 11 shall be replaced with references to  Lender
Conversion Shares  for purposes of this Section 4.4, and all references to the  Installment Conversion Price 
in Section 11 shall be replaced with references to the  Lender Conversion Price  for purposes of this Section 4.4.
For the avoidance of doubt, Lender s exercise of the rights granted to it pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall not relieve
Borrower of its obligation to continue paying the Installment Amount on all future Installment Dates. 

 5.  
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset . Borrower acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset (except as set forth in Section 20 below), deduction or counterclaim of
any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors and assigns,
and agrees to make the payments or Conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note. 

 6.  
  Waiver . No waiver of any provision of this Note shall be effective unless it is in the form of a writing signed by
the party granting the waiver. No waiver of any provision or consent to any prohibited action shall constitute a waiver of any
other provision or consent to any other prohibited action, whether or not similar. No waiver or consent shall constitute a continuing
waiver or consent or commit a party to provide a waiver or consent in the future except to the extent specifically set forth in
writing. 

 7.  
  Rights Upon Issuance of Securities . 

 7.1.  
  Subsequent Equity Sales . Except with respect to Excluded Securities, if Borrower or any subsidiary thereof, as applicable,
at any time this Note is outstanding, shall sell, issue or grant any Common Stock, option to purchase Common Stock, right to reprice,
preferred shares convertible into Common Stock, or debt, warrants, options or other instruments or securities to Lender or any
third party which are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock (collectively, the   Equity
Securities  ), including without limitation any Deemed Issuance, at an effective price per share less than the then effective
Lender Conversion Price (such issuance is referred to herein as a   Dilutive Issuance  ), then, the Lender Conversion
Price shall be automatically reduced and only reduced to equal such lower effective price per share. If the holder of any Equity
Securities so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion,
exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options, or rights per share which are issued in connection with
such Dilutive Issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is less than the Lender
Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Lender Conversion Price on the date of such
Dilutive Issuance, and the then effective Lender Conversion Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal such lower effective
price per share. Such adjustments described above to the Lender Conversion Price shall be permanent (subject to additional adjustments
under this section), and shall be made whenever such Equity Securities are issued. Borrower shall notify Lender, in writing, no
later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Equity Securities subject to this Section 7.1, indicating therein the
applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price, or other pricing terms (such notice, the
  Dilutive   Issuance Notice  ). For purposes of clarity, whether or not Borrower provides a Dilutive Issuance
Notice pursuant to this Section 7.1, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, on the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Lender
Conversion Price shall be lowered to equal the applicable effective price per share regardless of whether Borrower or Lender accurately
refers to such lower effective price per share in any subsequent Installment Notice or Lender Conversion Notice. 

 7.2.  
  Adjustment of Lender Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision
hereof, if Borrower at any time on or after the Effective Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Lender Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision hereof, if
Borrower at any time on or after the Effective Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes
of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Lender Conversion Price in effect immediately prior
to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall become effective immediately
after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 7.2 occurs
during the period that a Lender Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Lender Conversion Price
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

 7.3.  
  Other Events . In the event that Borrower (or any subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof
are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect Lender from dilution or if any event occurs of the
type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then Borrower s
board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Lender Conversion Price so as to
protect the rights of Lender, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.3 will increase the Lender Conversion
Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7, provided further that if Lender does not accept such adjustments
as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then Borrower s board of directors and Lender
shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments,
whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by Borrower. 

 8.  
  Borrower Installments . 

 8.1.  
  Installment Conversion Price . Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price for each Installment
Conversion (the   Installment Conversion Price  ) shall be the lesser of (a) the Lender Conversion Price, and
(b) the Market Price. 

 8.2.  
  Installment Conversions . Beginning on the date that is six (6) months after the Purchase Price Date and on the same
day of each month thereafter until the Maturity Date (each, an   Installment Date  ), if paying in cash, Borrower
shall pay to Lender the applicable Installment Amount due on such date subject to the provisions of this Section 8, and if paying
in Installment Conversion Shares (as defined below), Borrower shall deliver such Installment Conversion Shares on or before the
Delivery Date. Payments of each Installment Amount may be made (a) in cash;  provided, however , that in the event Lender
has paid off all or any portion of any Investor Note (such amount that is prepaid, the   Investor Note Prepayment Amount  ),
Borrower may not pay any portion of any Installment Amount in cash for a period of ninety (90) days following the date Investor
delivered the applicable Investor Note Prepayment Amount to Borrower (the   Standstill Period  ) and any payment
in cash of any Installment Amount made during the Standstill Period shall be deemed to be a prepayment pursuant to Section 1 above
and shall be subject to the Prepayment Premium provided in such section, or (b) by converting such Installment Amount into shares
of Common Stock (  Installment Conversion Shares  , and together with the Lender Conversion Shares, the   Conversion
Shares  ) in accordance with this Section 8 (each instance of Borrower thus converting, an   Installment Conversion  )
per the following formula: the number of Installment Conversion Shares equals the portion of the applicable Installment Amount
being converted divided by the Installment Conversion Price, or (c) by any combination of the foregoing, so long as the cash is
delivered to Lender on the applicable Installment Date and the Installment Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender on or before
the applicable Delivery Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower will not be entitled to elect an Installment Conversion with
respect to any portion of any applicable Installment Amount and shall be required to pay the entire amount of such Installment
Amount in cash if on the applicable Installment Date there is an Equity Conditions Failure, and such failure is not waived in writing
by Lender. Moreover, in the event Borrower desires to pay all or any portion of any Installment Amount in cash, it must notify
Lender in writing of such election and the portion of the applicable Installment Amount it elects to pay in cash not more than
twenty-five (25) or less than fifteen (15) Trading Days prior to the applicable Installment Date. If Borrower fails to so notify
Lender, it shall not be permitted to elect to pay any portion of such Installment Amount in cash unless otherwise agreed to by
Lender in writing or proposed by Lender in an Installment Notice delivered by Lender to Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary herein, Borrower shall only be obligated to deliver Installment Amounts with respect to Tranches that
have become Conversion Eligible Tranches and shall have no obligation to pay to Lender any Installment Amount with respect to any
Tranche that has not become a Conversion Eligible Tranche. In furtherance thereof, in the event Borrower has repaid all Conversion
Eligible Tranches pursuant to the terms of this Note, it shall have no further obligations to deliver any Installment Amount to
Lender unless and until any Subsequent Tranche that was not previously a Conversion Eligible Tranche becomes a Conversion Eligible
Tranche pursuant to the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding that failure to repay this Note in full by the Maturity Date is an
Event of Default, the Installment Dates shall continue after the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 8 until the Outstanding
Balance is repaid in full, provided that Lender shall, in Lender s sole discretion, determine the Installment Amount for
each Installment Date after the Maturity Date. 

 8.3.  
  Allocation of Installment Amounts . Subject to Section 8.2 regarding an Equity Conditions Failure, for each Installment
Date, Borrower may elect to allocate the amount of the applicable Installment Amount between cash and Installment Conversion, by
email or fax delivery of a notice to Lender substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit B  (each, an   Installment
Notice  ), provided, that to be effective, each applicable Installment Notice must be received by Lender not more than
twenty-five (25) or less than fifteen (15) Trading Days prior to the applicable Installment Date. If Lender has not received an
Installment Notice within such time period, then Lender may prepare the Installment Notice and deliver the same to Borrower by
fax or email. Following its receipt of such Installment Notice, Borrower may either ratify Lender s proposed allocation in
the applicable Installment Notice or elect to change the allocation by written notice to Lender by email or fax on or before 12:00
p.m. New York time on the applicable Installment Date, so long as the sum of the cash payments and the amount of Installment Conversions
equal the applicable Installment Amount, provided that Lender must approve any increase to the portion of the Installment Amount
payable in cash. If Borrower fails to notify Lender of its election to change the allocation prior to the deadline set forth in
the previous sentence (and seek approval to increase the amount payable in cash), it shall be deemed to have ratified and accepted
the allocation set forth in the applicable Installment Notice prepared by Lender. If neither Borrower nor Lender prepare and deliver
to the other party an Installment Notice as outlined above, then Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that the entire Installment
Amount be converted via an Installment Conversion. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that regardless of which party prepares the
applicable Installment Notice, the amounts and calculations set forth thereon are subject to correction or adjustment because of
error, mistake, or any adjustment resulting from an Event of Default or other adjustment permitted under the Transaction Documents
(an   Adjustment  ). Furthermore, no error or mistake in the preparation of such notices, or failure to apply
any Adjustment that could have been applied prior to the preparation of an Installment Notice may be deemed a waiver of Lender s
right to enforce the terms of the Note, even if such error, mistake, or failure to include an Adjustment arises from Lender s
own calculation. Borrower shall deliver the Installment Conversion Shares from any Installment Conversion to Lender in accordance
with Section 9 below on or before each applicable Delivery Date. 

 9.  
  Method of Conversion Share Delivery . On or before the close of business on the third (3 rd ) Trading Day
following the Installment Date or the third (3 rd ) Trading Day following the date of delivery of a Lender Conversion
Notice, as applicable (the   Delivery Date  ), Borrower shall, provided it is DWAC Eligible at such time, deliver
or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable Conversion Shares electronically via DWAC to the account designated by Lender
in the applicable Lender Conversion Notice or Installment Notice.   If Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, it shall deliver to
Lender or its broker (as designated in the Lender Conversion Notice or Installment Notice, as applicable), via reputable overnight
courier, a certificate representing the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares to which Lender
shall be entitled, registered in the name of Lender or its designee. For the avoidance of doubt, Borrower has not met its obligation
to deliver Conversion Shares by the Delivery Date unless Lender or its broker, as applicable, has actually received the certificate
representing the applicable Conversion Shares no later than the close of business on the relevant Delivery Date pursuant to the
terms set forth above. Moreover, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, in the
event Borrower or its transfer agent refuses to deliver any Conversion Shares to Lender on grounds that such issuance is in violation
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Rule 144  ), Borrower shall deliver or cause its transfer
agent to deliver the applicable Conversion Shares to Lender with a restricted securities legend, but otherwise in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 9. In conjunction therewith, Borrower will also deliver to Lender a written opinion from its counsel
or its transfer agent s counsel opining as to why the issuance of the applicable Conversion Shares violates Rule 144. 

 10.  
  Conversion Delays . If Borrower fails to deliver Conversion Shares or True-Up Shares in accordance with the timeframes
stated in Sections 9 or 11, as applicable, Lender, at any time prior to selling all of those Conversion Shares or True-Up Shares,
as applicable, may rescind in whole or in part that particular Conversion attributable to the unsold Conversion Shares or True-Up
Shares, with a corresponding increase to the Outstanding Balance (any returned amount will tack back to the Purchase Price Date
for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144). In addition, for each Lender Conversion, in the event that Lender
Conversion Shares are not delivered by the fourth Trading Day (inclusive of the day of the Lender Conversion), a late fee equal
to the greater of (a) $500.00 and (b) 2% of the applicable Lender Conversion Share Value rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.00
(but in any event the cumulative amount of such late fees for each Lender Conversion shall not exceed 200% of the applicable Lender
Conversion Share Value) will be assessed for each day after the third Trading Day (inclusive of the day of the Lender Conversion)
until Lender Conversion Share delivery is made; and such late fee will be added to the Outstanding Balance (such fees, the   Conversion
Delay Late Fees  ). For illustration purposes only, if Lender delivers a Lender Conversion Notice to Borrower pursuant
to which Borrower is required to deliver 100,000 Lender Conversion Shares to Lender and on the Delivery Date such Lender Conversion
Shares have a Lender Conversion Share Value of $20,000.00 (assuming a Closing Trade Price on the Delivery Date of $0.20 per share
of Common Stock), then in such event a Conversion Delay Late Fee in the amount of $500.00 per day (the greater of $500.00 per day
and $20,000.00 multiplied by 2%, which is $400.00) would be added to the Outstanding Balance of the Note until such Lender Conversion
Shares are delivered to Lender. For purposes of this example, if the Lender Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender twenty (20)
days after the applicable Delivery Date, the total Conversion Delay Late Fees that would be added to the Outstanding Balance would
be $10,000.00 (20 days multiplied by $500.00 per day). If the Lender Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender one hundred (100)
days after the applicable Delivery Date, the total Conversion Delay Late Fees that would be added to the Outstanding Balance would
be $40,000.00 (100 days multiplied by $500.00 per day, but capped at 200% of the Lender Conversion Share Value). 

 11.  
  True-Up . On the date that is twenty (20) Trading Days (a   True-Up Date  ) from each date that the
Installment Conversion Shares delivered by Borrower to Lender become Free Trading, there shall be a true-up where Borrower shall
deliver to Lender additional Installment Conversion Shares (  True-Up Shares  ) if the Installment Conversion
Price as of the True-Up Date is less than the Installment Conversion Price used in the applicable Installment Notice. In such event,
Borrower shall deliver to Lender within three (3) Trading Days of the True-Up Date (the   True-Up Share Delivery Date  )
a number of True-Up Shares equal to the difference between the number of Installment Conversion Shares that would have been delivered
to Lender on the True-Up Date based on the Installment Conversion Price as of the True-Up Date and the number of Installment Conversion
Shares originally delivered to Lender pursuant to the applicable Installment Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Installment
Conversion Price as of the True-Up Date is higher than the Installment Conversion Price set forth in the applicable Installment
Notice, then Borrower shall have no obligation to deliver True-Up Shares to Lender, nor shall Lender have any obligation to return
any excess Installment Conversion Shares to Borrower under any circumstance. For the convenience of Borrower only, Lender may,
in its sole discretion, deliver to Borrower a notice (pursuant to a form of notice substantially in the form attached hereto as
 Exhibit C ) informing Borrower of the number of True-Up Shares it is obligated to deliver to Lender as of any given True-Up
Date, provided that if Lender does not deliver any such notice, Borrower shall not be relieved of its obligation to deliver True-Up
Shares pursuant to this Section 11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower fails to deliver any required True-Up Shares on
or before any applicable True-Up Share Delivery Date, then in such event the Outstanding Balance of this Note will automatically
increase by a sum equal to the number of True-Up Shares deliverable as of the applicable True-Up Date multiplied by the Market
Price for the Common Stock as of the applicable True-Up Date (under Lender s and Borrower s expectations that any such
increase will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144). 

 12.  
  Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or the other Transaction Documents,
if at any time Lender shall or would be issued shares of Common Stock under any of the Transaction Documents, but such issuance
would cause Lender (together with its affiliates) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding on such date (including for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such issuance) (the
  Maximum Percentage  ), then Borrower must not issue to Lender shares of Common Stock which would exceed the
Maximum Percentage. For purposes of this section, beneficial ownership of Common Stock will be determined pursuant to Section 13(d)
of the 1934 Act. The shares of Common Stock issuable to Lender that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred
to herein as the   Ownership   Limitation   Shares  . Borrower will reserve the Ownership Limitation
Shares for the exclusive benefit of Lender. From time to time, Lender may notify Borrower in writing of the number of the Ownership
Limitation Shares that may be issued to Lender without causing Lender to exceed the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice,
Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated shares to Lender, with a corresponding reduction
in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the term  4.99%  above shall be replaced
with  9.99%  at such time as the Market Capitalization is less than $10,000,000.00. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained herein, if the term  4.99%  is replaced with  9.99%  pursuant to the preceding sentence, such
increase to  9.99%  shall remain at 9.99% until increased, decreased or waived by Lender as set forth below. By written
notice to Borrower, Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be
effective until the 61st day after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and
non-waivable and shall apply to all affiliates and assigns of Lender. 

 13.  
  Payment of Collection Costs . If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or enforcement prior
to commencing arbitration or legal proceedings, or is collected or enforced through any arbitration or legal proceeding, or Lender
otherwise takes action to collect amounts due under this Note or to enforce the provisions of this Note, then Borrower shall pay
the costs incurred by Lender for such collection, enforcement or action including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and
disbursements. Borrower also agrees to pay for any costs, fees or charges of its transfer agent that are charged to Lender pursuant
to any Conversion or issuance of shares pursuant to this Note. 

 14.  
  Opinion of Counsel . In the event that an opinion of counsel is needed for any matter related to this Note, Lender
has the right to have any such opinion provided by its counsel. Lender also has the right to have any such opinion provided by
Borrower s counsel. 

 15.  
  Governing Law; Venue . This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Note shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of
Utah, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. The provisions set
forth in the Purchase Agreement to determine the proper venue for any disputes are incorporated herein by this reference. 

 16.  
  Resolution of Disputes . 

 16.1.  
  Arbitration of Disputes . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by the Arbitration Provisions
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) set forth as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement. 

 16.2.  
  Calculation Disputes . Notwithstanding the Arbitration Provisions, in the case of a dispute as to any Calculation
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement), such dispute will be resolved in the manner set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

 17.  
  Cancellation . After repayment or conversion of the entire Outstanding Balance (including without limitation delivery
of True-Up Shares pursuant to the payment of the final Installment Amount, if applicable), this Note shall be deemed paid in full,
shall automatically be deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued. 

 18.  
  Amendments . The prior written consent of both parties hereto shall be required for any change or amendment to this
Note. 

 19.  
  Assignments . Borrower may not assign this Note without the prior written consent of Lender. This Note and any shares
of Common Stock issued upon conversion of this Note may be offered, sold, assigned or transferred by Lender without the consent
of Borrower. 

 20.  
  Offset Rights . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any of the other Transaction Documents, (a)
the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Lender maintains a right of offset pursuant to the terms of the Investor Notes that,
under certain circumstances, permits Lender to deduct amounts owed by Borrower under this Note from amounts otherwise owed by Lender
under the Investor Notes (the   Lender Offset Right  ), and (b) at any time Borrower shall be entitled to deduct
and offset any amount owing by the initial Lender under the Investor Notes from any amount owed by Borrower under this Note (the
  Borrower Offset Right  ). In order to exercise the Borrower Offset Right, Borrower must deliver to Lender (a)
a completed and signed Borrower Offset Right Notice in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit D , (b) the original Investor
Note being offset marked  cancelled  or, in the event the applicable Investor Note has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
a lost note affidavit in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender, and (c) a check payable to Lender in the amount of $250.00. In
the event that Borrower s exercise of the Borrower Offset Right results in the full satisfaction of Borrower s obligations
under this Note, Lender shall return the original Note to Borrower marked  cancelled  or, in the event this Note has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost note affidavit in a form reasonably acceptable to Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt,
Borrower shall not incur any Prepayment Premium set forth in Section 1 hereof with respect to any portions of this Note that are
satisfied by way of a Borrower Offset Right. 

 21.  
  Time is of the Essence . Time is expressly made of the essence with respect to each and every provision of this Note
and the documents and instruments entered into in connection herewith. 

 22.  
  Notices . Whenever notice is required to be given under this Note, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall
be given in accordance with the subsection of the Purchase Agreement titled  Notices.  

 23.  
  Liquidated Damages . Lender and Borrower agree that in the event Borrower fails to comply with any of the terms or
provisions of this Note, Lender s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate because
of the parties  inability to predict future interest rates, future share prices, future trading volumes and other relevant
factors. Accordingly, Lender and Borrower agree that any fees, balance adjustments, Default Interest or other charges assessed
under this Note are not penalties but instead are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under
Lender s and Borrower s expectations that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for
purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144). 

 24.  
  Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH OF LENDER AND BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO DEMAND
THAT ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS NOTE OR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE
STATUTE, LAW, RULE OR REGULATION. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING
SUCH PARTY S RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY. 

 25.  
  Voluntary Agreement . Borrower has carefully read this Note and has asked any questions needed for Borrower to understand
the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Note and fully understand them. Borrower has had the opportunity to seek the
advice of an attorney of Borrower s choosing, or has waived the right to do so, and is executing this Note voluntarily and
without any duress or undue influence by Lender or anyone else. 

 26.  
  Severability . If any part of this Note is construed to be in violation of any law, such part shall be modified to
achieve the objective of Borrower and Lender to the fullest extent permitted by law and the balance of this Note shall remain in
full force and effect. 

 27.  
  Par Value Adjustments . If at any time Lender delivers a Conversion Notice to Borrower and as of such date the Conversion
Price would be less than the Par Value, then, as liquidated damages, Company must pay to Lender the Par Value Adjustment Amount
in cash within one (1) Trading Day of delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice (a   Par Value Adjustment  ).
If Borrower does not deliver the Par Value Adjustment Amount as required, then such amount shall automatically be added to the
Outstanding Balance. The number of Conversion Shares deliverable pursuant to any relevant Conversion Notice following a Par Value
Adjustment shall be equal to (a) the Conversion Amount, divided by (b) the Par Value. In the event of a Par Value Adjustment, Lender
will use a Conversion Notice in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit E .

ATTACHMENT 1  

  DEFINITIONS  

For purposes
of this Note, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

 A1.  
   Adjusted Outstanding Balance   means the Outstanding Balance of this Note as of the date the applicable
Fundamental Default occurred less any Conversion Delay Late Fees included in such Outstanding Balance. 

 A2.  
   Approved Stock Plan   means any equity compensation plan which has been approved by the shareholders
of Borrower and is in effect as of the Purchase Price Date, pursuant to which Borrower s securities may be issued to any
employee, officer or director for services provided to Borrower. 

 A3.  
   Bloomberg   means Bloomberg L.P. (or if that service is not then reporting the relevant information regarding
the Common Stock, a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by Lender and reasonably satisfactory to Borrower). 

 A4.  
   Closing Bid Price   and   Closing Trade Price   means the last closing bid price and
last closing trade price, respectively, for the Common Stock on its principal market, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if its principal
market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not designate the closing bid price or the closing trade price (as
the case may be) then the last bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock prior to 4:00:00 p.m., New
York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if its principal market is not the principal securities exchange or trading market for
the Common Stock, the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock on the principal securities
exchange or trading market where the Common Stock is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg, or if the foregoing do not apply,
the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market on the electronic
bulletin board for the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, is
reported for the Common Stock by Bloomberg, the average of the bid prices, or the ask prices, respectively, of any market makers
for the Common Stock as reported by OTC Markets Group, Inc., and any successor thereto. If the Closing Bid Price or the Closing
Trade Price cannot be calculated for the Common Stock on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Bid Price
or the Closing Trade Price (as the case may be) of the Common Stock on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by Lender and Borrower. If Lender and Borrower are unable to agree upon the fair market value of the Common Stock, then such dispute
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures in Section 16.2. All such determinations shall be appropriately adjusted
for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during such period. 

 A5.  
   Conversion   means a Lender Conversion under Section 3 or an Installment Conversion under Section 8. 

 A6.  
   Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance   means the Outstanding Balance of this Note less the sum of
each Subsequent Tranche that has not yet become a Conversion Eligible Tranche (i.e., Lender has not yet paid the outstanding balance
of the Investor Note that corresponds to such Subsequent Tranche). 

 A7.  
   Conversion Factor   means 60%, subject to the following adjustments. If at any time the lowest intra-day
trade price during the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding any date of measurement is below $0.01, then in such event
the then-current Conversion Factor shall be reduced by 10% for all future Conversions (subject to other reductions set forth in
this section). If at any time after the Effective Date, Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor
will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. If at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares
are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by an additional 5% for all future
Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date, the Conversion Factor
shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that
occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate
occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate
times). For example, the first time Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will
be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. Following such event, the first time the Conversion Shares are no longer
DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 55% to 50% for purposes of this example.
If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(c), then for purposes of this
example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third
occurrences of such Major Default. 

 A8.  
   Deemed Issuance   means an issuance of Common Stock that shall be deemed to have occurred on the latest
possible permitted date pursuant to the terms hereof or any applicable Warrant in the event Borrower fails to deliver Conversion
Shares as and when required pursuant to Section 9 of the Note or Warrant Shares (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) as and when
required pursuant to the Warrants. For the avoidance of doubt, if Borrower has elected or is deemed under Section 8.3 to have elected
to pay an Installment Amount in Installment Conversion Shares and fails to deliver such Installment Conversion Shares, such failure
shall be considered a Deemed Issuance hereunder even if an Equity Conditions Failure exists at that time or other relevant date
of determination. 

 A9.  
   Default Effect   means multiplying the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance as of the date the applicable
Event of Default occurred by (a) 15% for each occurrence of any Major Default, or (b) 5% for each occurrence of any Minor Default,
and then adding the resulting product to the Outstanding Balance as of the date the applicable Event of Default occurred, with
the sum of the foregoing then becoming the Outstanding Balance under this Note as of the date the applicable Event of Default occurred;
provided that the Default Effect may only be applied three (3) times hereunder with respect to Major Defaults and three (3) times
hereunder with respect to Minor Defaults; and provided further that the Default Effect shall not apply to any Event of Default
pursuant to Section 4.1(b) hereof. 

 A10.  
   DTC   means the Depository Trust Company or any successor thereto. 

 A11.

   DTC/FAST Program   means the DTC s Fast Automated Securities Transfer program. 

 A13.  
   DWAC   means the DTC s Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system. 

 A14.  
   DWAC Eligible   means that (a) Borrower s Common Stock is eligible at DTC for full services pursuant
to DTC s operational arrangements, including without limitation transfer through DTC s DWAC system, (b) Borrower has
been approved (without revocation) by DTC s underwriting department, (c) Borrower s transfer agent is approved as an
agent in the DTC/FAST Program, (d) the Conversion Shares are otherwise eligible for delivery via DWAC; (e) Borrower has previously
delivered all Conversion Shares to Lender via DWAC; and (f) Borrower s transfer agent does not have a policy prohibiting
or limiting delivery of the Conversion Shares via DWAC. 

 A15.  
   Equity Conditions Failure   means that any of the following conditions has not been satisfied during
any applicable Equity Conditions Measuring Period (as defined below): (a) with respect to the applicable date of determination
all of the Conversion Shares would be freely tradable under Rule 144 or without the need for registration under any applicable
federal or state securities laws (in each case, disregarding any limitation on conversion of this Note); (b) on each day during
the period beginning one month prior to the applicable date of determination and ending on and including the applicable date of
determination (the   Equity Conditions Measuring Period  ), the Common Stock is listed or designated for quotation
(as applicable) on any of NYSE, NASDAQ, OTCQX, OTCQB, or OTC Pink Current Information (each, an   Eligible Market  )
and shall not have been suspended from trading on any such Eligible Market (other than suspensions of not more than two (2) Trading
Days and occurring prior to the applicable date of determination due to business announcements by Borrower); (c) on each day
during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, Borrower shall have delivered all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note on a timely basis as set forth in Section 9 hereof and all other shares of capital stock required to be delivered
by Borrower on a timely basis as set forth in the other Transaction Documents; (d) any shares of Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the event requiring determination may be issued in full without violating Section 12 hereof (Lender acknowledges
that Borrower shall be entitled to assume that this condition has been met for all purposes hereunder absent written notice from
Lender); (e) any shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with the event requiring determination may be issued in
full without violating the rules or regulations of the Eligible Market on which the Common Stock is then listed or designated for
quotation (as applicable); (f) on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, no public announcement of a pending,
proposed or intended Fundamental Transaction shall have occurred which has not been abandoned, terminated or consummated; (g) Borrower
shall have no knowledge of any fact that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the Conversion Shares to not be freely tradable
without the need for registration under any applicable state securities laws (in each case, disregarding any limitation on conversion
of this Note); (h) on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, Borrower otherwise shall have been in material
compliance with each, and shall not have breached any, term, provision, covenant, representation or warranty of any Transaction
Document; (i) without limiting clause (j) above, on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, there shall not
have occurred an Event of Default or an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute an Event of Default;
(k) on each Installment Date, the average and median daily dollar volume of the Common Stock on its principal market for the previous
twenty (20) Trading Days shall be greater than $20,000.00; (l) the ten (10) day average VWAP of the Common Stock is greater than
$0.01; and (m) the Common Stock shall be DWAC Eligible as of each applicable Installment Date or other date of determination. 

 A16.  
   Excluded Securities   means any shares of Common Stock, options, or convertible securities issued or
issuable in connection with any Approved Stock Plan;  provided that  the option term, exercise price or similar provisions
of any issuances pursuant to such Approved Stock Plan are not amended, modified or changed on or after the Purchase Price Date. 

 A17.  
   Free Trading   means that (a) the shares or certificate(s) representing the applicable shares of Common
Stock have been cleared and approved for public resale by the compliance departments of Lender s brokerage firm and the clearing
firm servicing such brokerage, and (b) such shares are held in the name of the clearing firm servicing Lender s brokerage
firm and have been deposited into such clearing firm s account for the benefit of Lender. 

 A18.  
   Fundamental Default   means that Borrower either fails to pay the entire Outstanding Balance to Lender
on or before the Maturity Date or fails to pay the Mandatory Default Amount within three (3) Trading Days of the date Lender delivers
any notice of acceleration to Borrower pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Note. 

 A19.  
   Fundamental Default Conversion Value   means the Adjusted Outstanding Balance multiplied by the highest
Fundamental Default Ratio that occurs during the Fundamental Default Measuring Period. 

 A20.  
   Fundamental Default Measuring Period   means a number of months equal to the Outstanding Balance as of
the date the Fundamental Default occurred divided by the Installment Amount, with such number being rounded up to the next whole
month;  provided, however , that if Borrower repays the entire Outstanding Balance prior to the conclusion of the Fundamental
Default Measuring Period, the Fundamental Default Measuring Period shall end on the date of repayment. For illustration purposes
only, if the Outstanding Balance were equal to $125,000.00 as of the date a Fundamental Default occurred and if the Installment
Amount were $28,500.00, then the Fundamental Default Measuring Period would equal five (5) months calculated as follows: $125,000.00/$28,500.00
equals 4.386, rounded up to five (5). 

 A21.  
   Fundamental Default Ratio   means a ratio that will be calculated on each Trading Day during the Fundamental
Default Measuring Period by dividing the Closing Trade Price for the Common Stock on a given Trading Day by the Lender Conversion
Price (as adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof) in effect for such Trading Day. 

 A22.  
   Fundamental Liquidated Damages Amount   means the greater of (a) (i) the quotient of the Outstanding
Balance on the date the Fundamental Default occurred divided by the then-current Conversion Factor, minus (ii) the Outstanding
Balance on the date the Fundamental Default occurred, or (b) the Fundamental Default Conversion Value. 

 A23.  
   Fundamental Transaction   means that (a) (i) Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not Borrower or any of its subsidiaries
is the surviving corporation) any other person or entity, or (ii) Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions, sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its respective properties or assets to any other person or entity, or (iii) Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, allow any other person or entity to make a purchase, tender or exchange

or entities making or party to, such purchase, tender or exchange offer), or (iv) Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, consummate a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination

interest on all Conversion Eligible Tranches as of the applicable Installment Date, and accrued and unpaid late charges, if any,
under this Note as of the applicable Installment Date, and any other amounts accruing or owing to Lender under this Note as of
such Installment Date;  provided, however,  that, if the remaining amount owing under all then-existing Conversion Eligible
Tranches or otherwise with respect to this Note as of the applicable Installment Date is less than the Installment Amount set forth
above, then the Installment Amount for such Installment Date (and only such Installment Amount) shall be reduced (and only reduced)
by the amount necessary to cause such Installment Amount to equal such outstanding amount. 

 A25.

pursuant to any Lender Conversion multiplied by the Closing Trade Price of the Common Stock on the Delivery Date for such Lender

product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing (1) the applicable Optional Prepayment Amount by (2) the
Lender Conversion Price as of the date Borrower delivered the applicable Optional Prepayment Amount to Lender, multiplied by (ii)
the Closing Trade Price of the Common Stock on the date Borrower delivered the applicable Optional Prepayment Amount to Lender,
and (b) the applicable Optional Prepayment Amount paid by Borrower to Lender. For illustration purposes only, if the applicable
Optional Prepayment Amount were $50,000.00, the Lender Conversion Price as of the date the Optional Prepayment Amount was paid
to Lender was equal to $0.75 per share of Common Stock, and the Closing Trade Price of a share of Common Stock as of such date
was equal to $1.00, then the Optional Prepayment Liquidated Damages Amount would equal $16,666.67 computed as follows: (a) $66,666.67
(calculated as (i) (1) $50,000.00 divided by (2) $0.75 multiplied by (ii) $1.00) minus (b) $50,000.00. 

 A34.  
   Other Agreements   means, collectively, (a) all existing and future agreements and instruments between,
among or by Borrower (or an affiliate), on the one hand, and Lender (or an affiliate), on the other hand, and (b) any financing

 A35.  
   Outstanding Balance   means as of any date of determination, the Purchase Price, as reduced or increased,
as the case may be, pursuant to the terms hereof for payment, Conversion, offset, or otherwise, plus the OID, the Transaction Expense
Amount, accrued but unpaid interest, collection and enforcements costs (including attorneys  fees) incurred by Lender, transfer,
stamp, issuance and similar taxes and fees related to Conversions, and any other fees or charges (including without limitation
Conversion Delay Late Fees) incurred under this Note. 

 A36.  
   Par Value   means the par value of the Common Stock on any relevant date of determination. The Par Value
as of the Effective Date is $0.0001. 

 A37.  
   Par Value Adjustment Amount   means an amount calculated as follows: (a) the number of Conversion Shares
deliverable under a particular Conversion Notice (prior to any Par Value Adjustment) multiplied by the Par Value, less (b) the
Conversion Amount (prior to any Par Value Adjustment), plus (c) $500.00. For illustration purposes only, if for a given Conversion,
the Conversion Amount was $20,000.00, the Conversion Price was $0.0008 and the Par Value was $0.001 then the Par Value Adjustment
Amount would be $5,500.00 (25,000,000 Conversion Shares ($20,000.00/$0.0008) multiplied by the Par Value of $0.001 ($25,000.00)
minus the Conversion Amount of $20,000.00 plus $500.00 equals $5,500.00). 

 A38.  
   Purchase Price Date   means the date the Initial Cash Purchase Price is delivered by Lender to Borrower. 

 A39.  
   Trading Day   means any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.

   VWAP   means the volume weighted average price of the Common stock on the principal market for a particular
Trading Day or set of Trading Days, as the case may be, as reported by Bloomberg.

costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities
(the   Transaction Expense Amount  ), all of which amount is included in the initial principal balance of the
Note. The Purchase Price, therefore, shall be $500,000.00, computed as follows: $555,000.00 initial principal balance, less the
OID, less the Transaction Expense Amount. The Initial Cash Purchase Price shall be the Purchase Price less the sum of the initial
principal amounts of the Investor Notes. The portions of the OID and the Transaction Expense Amount allocated to the Initial Cash
Purchase Price are set forth on  Exhibit C .

  4.  
  Company Covenants . Until all of Company s obligations under all of the Transaction Documents are paid and
performed in full, or within the timeframes otherwise specifically set forth below, Company will at all times comply with the
following covenants: (i) so long as Investor beneficially owns any of the Securities and for at least twenty (20) Trading Days
(as defined in the Note) thereafter, Company will timely file on the applicable deadline all reports required to be filed with
the SEC pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, and will take all reasonable action under its control to ensure
that adequate current public information with respect to Company, as required in accordance with Rule 144 of the 1933 Act, is
publicly available, and will not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports under the 1934 Act even if the 1934
Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would permit such termination; (ii) the Common Stock shall be listed or quoted for
trading on any of (a) NYSE, (b) NASDAQ, (c) OTCQX, (d) OTCQB, or (e) OTC Pink Current Information; (iii) when issued, the Conversion
Shares and the Warrant Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid for and non-assessable, free and clear of all
liens, claims, charges and encumbrances; (iv) trading in Company s Common Stock will not be suspended, halted, chilled,
frozen, reach zero bid or otherwise cease on Company s principal trading market; (v) Company will not transfer, assign,
sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise alienate or encumber the Investor Notes in any way without the prior written consent of
Investor, which consent may be given or withheld in Investor s sole and absolute discretion; (vi) Company will not have
at any given time more than two (2) Variable Security Holders (as defined below), excluding Investor, without Investor s
prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in Investor s sole and absolute discretion; (vii) at Closing
and on the first day of each calendar quarter for so long as the Note remains outstanding or on any other date during which the
Note is outstanding, as may be requested by Investor, Company shall cause its Chief Executive Officer to provide to Investor a
certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit E  (the   Officer s Certificate  )
certifying in his personal capacity and in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Company the number of Variable Security
Holders of Company as of the date the applicable Officer s Certificate is executed; and (viii) if at any time the Common
Stock trades below $0.0005, Company shall, as soon as practicable but in no event longer than sixty (60) days thereafter, reduce
the par value of its Common Stock to $0.00001 or below. For purposes hereof, the term   Variable Security Holder  
means any holder of any Company securities that (A) have or may have conversion rights of any kind, contingent, conditional or
otherwise, in which the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to such conversion right varies with the market price of
the Common Stock, or (B) are or may become convertible into Common Stock (including without limitation convertible debt, warrants
or convertible preferred stock), with a conversion price that varies with the market price of the Common Stock, even if such security
only becomes convertible following an event of default, the passage of time, or another trigger event or condition (each a   Variable
Security Issuance  ). For avoidance of doubt, the issuance of shares of Common Stock under, pursuant to, in exchange
for or in connection with any contract or instrument, whether convertible or not, is deemed a Variable Security Issuance for purposes
hereof if the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued is based upon or related in any way to the market price of the Common
Stock, including, but not limited to, Common Stock issued in connection with a Section 3(a)(9) exchange, a Section 3(a)(10) settlement,
or any other similar settlement or exchange.  

  5.  
  Conditions to Company s Obligation to Sell . The obligation of Company hereunder to issue and sell the Securities
to Investor at the Closing is subject to the satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:  

  5.1.  
 Investor shall have executed this Agreement and the Investor Notes and delivered the same to Company.  

  5.2.  
 Investor shall have delivered the Initial Cash Purchase Price to Company in accordance with Section 1.2 above.  

  6.  
  Conditions to Investor s Obligation to Purchase . The obligation of Investor hereunder to purchase the Securities
at the Closing is subject to the satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions, provided that
these conditions are for Investor s sole benefit and may be waived by Investor at any time in its sole discretion:  

  6.1.  
 Company shall have executed this Agreement, the Warrants, and the Note and delivered the same to Investor.  

  6.2.  
 Company s Chief Executive Officer shall have executed the Officer s Certificate and delivered the same to Investor.  

  6.3.  
 Company shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Irrevocable Letter of Instructions to Transfer Agent (the   TA
Letter  ) substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit F  acknowledged and agreed to in writing by Company s
transfer agent (the   Transfer Agent  ).  

  6.4.  
 Company shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Secretary s Certificate substantially in the form attached
hereto as  Exhibit G  evidencing Company s approval of the Transaction Documents.  

  6.5.  
 Company shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Share Issuance Resolution substantially in the form attached
hereto as  Exhibit H  to be delivered to the Transfer Agent.  

  6.6.  
  Company shall have delivered to Investor fully executed copies of all other Transaction Documents required to be executed
by Company herein or therein.  

  7.  
  Reservation of Shares . At all times during which the Note is convertible or any Warrant is exercisable for shares
of Common Stock, Company will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock to provide for all issuances of Common Stock
under the Note and Warrant at least (i) five (5) times the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the Outstanding
Balance (as defined in the Note) by the Installment Conversion Price (as defined in the Note),  plus  (ii) five (5) times
the number of Warrant Shares (as determined pursuant to the Warrants) deliverable upon full exercise of the Warrants (the   Share
Reserve  ), but in any event not less than 70,000,000 shares of Common Stock shall be reserved at all times for such
purpose (the   Transfer Agent Reserve  ). Company further agrees that it will cause the Transfer Agent to immediately
add shares of Common Stock to the Transfer Agent Reserve in increments of 10,000,000 shares as and when requested by Investor
in writing from time to time, provided that such incremental increases do not cause the Transfer Agent Reserve to exceed the Share
Reserve. In furtherance thereof, from and after the date hereof and until such time that the Note has been paid in full and the
Warrants exercised in full, Company shall require the Transfer Agent to reserve for the purpose of issuance of Conversion Shares
under the Note and Warrant Shares under the Warrants, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Transfer Agent Reserve.
Company shall further require the Transfer Agent to hold such shares of Common Stock exclusively for the benefit of Investor and
to issue such shares to Investor promptly upon Investor s delivery of a conversion notice under the Note or a notice of
exercise under any Warrant. Finally, Company shall require the Transfer Agent to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
Note and the Warrants to Investor out of its authorized and unissued shares, and not the Transfer Agent Reserve, to the extent
shares of Common Stock have been authorized, but not issued, and are not included in the Transfer Agent Reserve. The Transfer
Agent shall only issue shares out of the Transfer Agent Reserve to the extent there are no other authorized shares available for
issuance and then only with Investor s written consent.  

  8.  
  Terms of Future Financings . So long as the Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by Company of any security with
any term or condition more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that
was not similarly provided to Investor in the Transaction Documents, then Company shall notify Investor of such additional or
more favorable term and such term, at Investor s option, shall become a part of the Transaction Documents for the benefit
of Investor. Additionally, if Company fails to notify Investor of any such additional or more favorable term, but Investor becomes
aware that Company has granted such a term to any third party, Investor may notify Company of such additional or more favorable
term and such term shall become a part of the Transaction Documents retroactive to the date on which such term was granted to
the applicable third party. The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder of such
security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, conversion lookback periods, interest rates,
original issue discounts, stock sale price, conversion price per share, warrant coverage, warrant exercise price, and anti-dilution/conversion
and exercise price resets.  

  9.  
  Miscellaneous . The provisions set forth in this Section 9 shall apply to this Agreement, as well as all other Transaction
Documents as if these terms were fully set forth therein; provided, however, that in the event there is a conflict between any
provision set forth in this Section 9 and any provision in any other Transaction Document, the provision in such other Transaction
Document shall govern.  

  9.1.  
  Certain Capitalized Terms . To the extent any capitalized term used in any Transaction Document is defined in any
other Transaction Document (as noted therein), such capitalized term shall remain applicable in the Transaction Document in which
it is so used even if the other Transaction Document (wherein such term is defined) has been released, satisfied, or is otherwise
cancelled or terminated.  

  9.2.  
  Arbitration of Claims . The parties shall submit all Claims (as defined in  Exhibit I ) arising under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or any other agreement between the parties and their affiliates or any Claim relating to the
relationship of the parties to binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions set forth in  Exhibit I  attached
hereto (the   Arbitration Provisions  ). The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Arbitration Provisions
are unconditionally binding on the parties hereto and are severable from all other provisions of this Agreement. By executing
this Agreement, Company represents, warrants and covenants that Company has reviewed the Arbitration Provisions carefully, consulted
with legal counsel about such provisions (or waived its right to do so), understands that the Arbitration Provisions are intended
to allow for the expeditious and efficient resolution of any dispute hereunder, agrees to the terms and limitations set forth
in the Arbitration Provisions, and that Company will not take a position contrary to the foregoing representations. Company acknowledges
and agrees that Investor may rely upon the foregoing representations and covenants of Company regarding the Arbitration Provisions.  

  9.3.  
  Governing Law; Venue . This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State
of Utah, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. Each party
consents to and expressly agrees that exclusive venue for arbitration of any dispute arising out of or relating to any Transaction
Document or the relationship of the parties or their affiliates shall be in Salt Lake County, Utah. Without modifying the parties
obligations to resolve disputes hereunder pursuant to the Arbitration Provisions, for any litigation arising in connection with
any of the Transaction Documents (and notwithstanding the terms (specifically including any governing law and venue terms) of
any transfer agent services agreement or other agreement between the Transfer Agent and Company, such litigation specifically
includes, without limitation any action between or involving Company and the Transfer Agent under the TA Letter or otherwise related
to Investor in any way (specifically including, without limitation, any action where Company seeks to obtain an injunction, temporary
restraining order, or otherwise prohibit the Transfer Agent from issuing shares of Common Stock to Investor for any reason)),
each party hereto hereby (i) consents to and expressly submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah, (ii) expressly submits to the exclusive venue of any such court for the purposes hereof,
(iii) agrees to not bring any such action (specifically including, without limitation, any action where Company seeks to obtain
an injunction, temporary restraining order, or otherwise prohibit the Transfer Agent from issuing shares of Common Stock to Investor
for any reason) outside of any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah, and (iv) waives any claim of improper
venue and any claim or objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or any other claim, defense or objection to the bringing
of any such proceeding in such jurisdiction or to any claim that such venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. Finally,
Company covenants and agrees to name Investor as a party in interest in, and provide written notice to Investor in accordance
with Section 9.13 below prior to bringing or filing, any action (including without limitation any filing or action against any
person or entity that is not a party to this Agreement, including without limitation the Transfer Agent) that is related in any
way to the Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated herein or therein, including without limitation any action brought
by Company to enjoin or prevent the issuance of any shares of Common Stock to Investor by the Transfer Agent, and further agrees
to timely name Investor as a party to any such action. Company acknowledges that the governing law and venue provisions set forth
in this Section 9.3 are material terms to induce Investor to enter into the Transaction Documents and that but for Company s
agreements set forth in this Section 9.3 Investor would not have entered into the Transaction Documents.  

  9.4.  
  Specific Performance . Company acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage may occur to Investor in the event
that Company fails to perform any material provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents in accordance
with its specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that Investor shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
cure breaches of the provisions of this Agreement or such other Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof or thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any Investor may be entitled under the Transaction
Documents, at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Investor seeks to obtain an injunction against Company
or specific performance of any provision of any Transaction Document, such action shall not be a waiver of any right of Investor
under any Transaction Document, at law, or in equity, including without limitation its rights to arbitrate any Claim pursuant
to the terms of the Transaction Documents.  

  9.5.  
  Calculation Disputes . Notwithstanding the Arbitration Provisions, in the case of a dispute as to any determination
or arithmetic calculation under the Transaction Documents, including without limitation, calculating the Outstanding Balance,
Warrant Shares, Exercise Shares (as defined in the Warrants), Delivery Shares (as defined in the Warrants), Lender Conversion
Price (as defined in the Note), Lender Conversion Shares (as defined in the Note), Installment Conversion Price, Installment Conversion
Shares (as defined in the Note), Conversion Factor (as defined in the Note), Market Price (as defined in the Note), or VWAP (as
defined in the Note) (each, a   Calculation  ), Company or Investor (as the case may be) shall submit any disputed
Calculation via email or facsimile with confirmation of receipt (i) within two (2) Trading Days after receipt of the applicable
notice giving rise to such dispute to Company or Investor (as the case may be) or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute,
at any time after Investor learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If Investor and Company are unable to agree
upon such Calculation within two (2) Trading Days of such disputed Calculation being submitted to Company or Investor (as the
case may be), then Investor will promptly submit via email or facsimile the disputed Calculation to Unkar Systems Inc. (  Unkar
Systems  ). Investor shall cause Unkar Systems to perform the Calculation and notify Company and Investor of the results
no later than ten (10) Trading Days from the time it receives such disputed Calculation. Unkar Systems  determination of
the disputed Calculation shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error. Unkar Systems  fee for performing
such Calculation shall be paid by the incorrect party, or if both parties are incorrect, by the party whose Calculation is furthest
from the correct Calculation as determined by Unkar Systems. In the event Company is the losing party, no extension of the Delivery
Date (as defined in the Note) shall be granted and Company shall incur all effects for failing to deliver the applicable shares
in a timely manner as set forth in the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor may, in its sole discretion,
designate an independent, reputable investment bank or accounting firm other than Unkar Systems to resolve any such dispute and
in such event, all references to  Unkar Systems  herein will be replaced with references to such independent, reputable
investment bank or accounting firm so designated by Investor.  

  9.6.  
  Counterparts . Each Transaction Document may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. The parties hereto confirm that any electronic copy of
another party s executed counterpart of a Transaction Document (or such party s signature page thereof) will be deemed
to be an executed original thereof.  

  9.7.  
  Document Imaging . Investor shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to image or make copies of all or any selection
of the agreements, instruments, documents, and items and records governing, arising from or relating to any of Company s
loans, including, without limitation, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and Investor may destroy or archive
the paper originals. The parties hereto (i) waive any right to insist or require that Investor produce paper originals, (ii)
agree that such images shall be accorded the same force and effect as the paper originals, (iii) agree that Investor is entitled
to use such images in lieu of destroyed or archived originals for any purpose, including as admissible evidence in any demand,
presentment or other proceedings, and (iv) further agree that any executed facsimile (faxed), scanned, emailed, or other imaged
copy of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be deemed to be of the same force and effect as the original manually
executed document.  

  9.8.  
  Headings . The headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not form part of, or affect
the interpretation of, this Agreement.  

  9.9.  
  Severability . In the event that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable
statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall
be deemed modified to conform to such statute or rule of law. Any provision hereof which may prove invalid or unenforceable under
any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.  

  9.10.  
  Entire Agreement . This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents, contains the entire understanding
of the parties with respect to the matters covered herein and therein and, except as specifically set forth herein or therein,
neither Company nor Investor makes any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking with respect to such matters. For the
avoidance of doubt, all prior term sheets or other documents between Company and Investor, or any affiliate thereof, related to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (collectively,   Prior Agreements  ), that may have
been entered into between Company and Investor, or any affiliate thereof, are hereby null and void and deemed to be replaced in
their entirety by the Transaction Documents. To the extent there is a conflict between any term set forth in any Prior Agreement
and the term(s) of the Transaction Documents, the Transaction Documents shall govern.  

  9.11.  
  No Reliance . Company acknowledges and agrees that neither Investor nor any of its officers, directors, members,
managers, representatives or agents has made any representations or warranties to Company or any of its officers, directors, representatives,
agents or employees except as expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents and, in making its decision to enter into the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, Company is not relying on any representation, warranty, covenant or promise of Investor
or its officers, directors, members, managers, agents or representatives other than as set forth in the Transaction Documents.  

  9.12.  
  Amendments . No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended other than by an instrument in writing signed
by both parties hereto.  

  9.13.

9.14.  
  Successors and Assigns . This Agreement or any of the severable rights and obligations inuring to the benefit of
or to be performed by Investor hereunder may be assigned by Investor to a third party, including its affiliates, in whole or in
part, without the need to obtain Company s consent thereto. Company may not assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement or delegate its duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Investor.  

  9.15.  
  Survival . The representations and warranties of Company and the agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing hereunder notwithstanding any due diligence investigation conducted by or on behalf of Investor. Company
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Investor and all its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and agents for loss or damage
arising as a result of or related to any breach or alleged breach by Company of any of its representations, warranties and covenants
set forth in this Agreement or any of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement, including advancement of expenses as
they are incurred.  

  9.16.  
  Further Assurances . Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and
things, and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other party may
reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.  

  9.17.  
  Investor s Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Liquidated Damages . All rights, remedies, and powers conferred
in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies, and shall be
in addition to every other right, power, and remedy that Investor may have, whether specifically granted in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, or existing at law, in equity, or by statute, and any and all such rights and remedies may be
exercised from time to time and as often and in such order as Investor may deem expedient. The parties acknowledge and agree that
upon Company s failure to comply with the provisions of the Transaction Documents, Investor s damages would be uncertain
and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate because of the parties  inability to predict future interest rates
and future share prices, Investor s increased risk, and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment
opportunity for Investor, among other reasons. Accordingly, any fees, charges, and default interest due under the Note, the Warrants,
and the other Transaction Documents are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Company s
and Investor s expectations that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Closing Date for purposes of determining
the holding period under Rule 144 under the 1933 Act). The parties agree that such liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate
of Investor s actual damages and not a penalty, and shall not be deemed in any way to limit any other right or remedy Investor
may have hereunder, at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that under the circumstances existing at the time this
Agreement is entered into, such liquidated damages are fair and reasonable and are not penalties. All fees, charges, and default
interest provided for in the Transaction Documents are agreed to by the parties to be based upon the obligations and the risks
assumed by the parties as of the Closing Date and are consistent with investments of this type. The liquidated damages provisions
of the Transaction Documents shall not limit or preclude a party from pursuing any other remedy available at law or in equity;
 provided, however , that the liquidated damages provided for in the Transaction Documents are intended to be in lieu of
actual damages.  

  9.18.  
  Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, if at any time Investor would be issued shares of Common Stock under any of the Transaction Documents, but such issuance
would cause Investor (together with its affiliates) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding the Maximum Percentage (as
defined in the Note), then Company must not issue to Investor the shares that would cause Investor to exceed the Maximum Percentage.
The shares of Common Stock issuable to Investor that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein
as the   Ownership Limitation Shares  . Company shall reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive
benefit of Investor. From time to time, Investor may notify Company in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares
that may be issued to Investor without causing Investor to exceed the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Company
shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated shares to Investor, with a corresponding reduction in
the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. For purposes of this Section, beneficial ownership of Common Stock will be determined
under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act.  

  9.19.  
  Attorneys  Fees and Cost of Collection . In the event of any arbitration or action at law or in equity to enforce
or interpret the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, the parties agree that the party who is awarded
the most money (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines, penalties, fees,
or other charges awarded to any party) shall be deemed the prevailing party for all purposes and shall therefore be entitled to
an additional award of the full amount of the attorneys  fees, deposition costs, and expenses paid by such prevailing party
in connection with arbitration or litigation without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual claims or defenses giving
rise to the fees and expenses. Nothing herein shall restrict or impair an arbitrator s or a court s power to award
fees and expenses for frivolous or bad faith pleading. If (i) the Note or any Warrant is placed in the hands of an attorney
for collection or enforcement prior to commencing arbitration or legal proceedings, or is collected or enforced through any arbitration
or legal proceeding, or Investor otherwise takes action to collect amounts due under the Note or to enforce the provisions of
the Note or any Warrant, or (ii) there occurs any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership of Company or other proceedings
affecting Company s creditors  rights and involving a claim under the Note or any Warrant; then Company shall pay
the costs incurred by Investor for such collection, enforcement or action or in connection with such bankruptcy, reorganization,
receivership or other proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees, expenses, deposition costs, and disbursements.  

  9.20.  
  Waiver . No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in the form of a writing signed
by the party granting the waiver. No waiver of any provision or consent to any prohibited action shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision or consent to any other prohibited action, whether or not similar. No waiver or consent shall constitute a
continuing waiver or consent or commit a party to provide a waiver or consent in the future except to the extent specifically
set forth in writing.  

  9.21.  
   Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL

JURY .

Exhibit
I    

ARBITRATION
PROVISIONS   

1.  Dispute
Resolution . For purposes of this  Exhibit I , the term   Claims   means any disputes, claims, demands,
causes of action, requests for injunctive relief, requests for specific performance, liabilities, damages, losses, or controversies
whatsoever arising from, related to, or connected with the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents and any communications
between the parties related thereto, including without limitation any claims of mutual mistake, mistake, fraud, misrepresentation,
failure of formation, failure of consideration, promissory estoppel, unconscionability, failure of condition precedent, rescission,
and any statutory claims, tort claims, contract claims, or claims to void, invalidate or terminate the Agreement (or these Arbitration
Provisions (defined below)) or any of the other Transaction Documents. The term  Claims  specifically excludes a dispute
over Calculations. The parties to the Agreement (the   parties  ) hereby agree that the arbitration provisions
set forth in this  Exhibit I  (  Arbitration Provisions  ) are binding on each of them. As a result, any
attempt to rescind the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions) or declare the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions)
or any other Transaction Document invalid or unenforceable for any reason is subject to these Arbitration Provisions. These Arbitration
Provisions shall also survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement. Any capitalized term not defined in these Arbitration
Provisions shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.  

  2.  Arbitration .
Except as otherwise provided herein, all Claims must be submitted to arbitration (  Arbitration  ) to be conducted
exclusively in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah and pursuant to the terms set forth in these Arbitration Provisions. Subject
to the arbitration appeal right provided for in Paragraph 5 below (the   Appeal Right  ), the parties agree that
the award of the arbitrator rendered pursuant to Paragraph 4 below (the   Arbitration Award  ) shall be (a) final
and binding upon the parties, (b) the sole and exclusive remedy between them regarding any Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings
presented or pleaded to the arbitrator, and (c) promptly payable in United States dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset
(with respect to monetary awards). Subject to the Appeal Right, any costs or fees, including without limitation attorneys 
fees, incurred in connection with or incident to enforcing the Arbitration Award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
be charged against the party resisting such enforcement. The Arbitration Award shall include default interest (as defined or otherwise
provided for in the Note,   Default Interest  ) (with respect to monetary awards) at the rate specified in the
Note for Default Interest both before and after the Arbitration Award. Judgment upon the Arbitration Award will be entered and
enforced by any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah.  

  3.  The
Arbitration Act . The parties hereby incorporate herein the provisions and procedures set forth in the Utah Uniform Arbitration
Act, U.C.A.   78B-11-101  et seq.  (as amended or superseded from time to time, the   Arbitration Act  ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to, and to the maximum extent permitted by, Section 105 of the Arbitration Act, in the
event of conflict or variation between the terms of these Arbitration Provisions and the provisions of the Arbitration Act, the
terms of these Arbitration Provisions shall control and the parties hereby waive or otherwise agree to vary the effect of all
requirements of the Arbitration Act that may conflict with or vary from these Arbitration Provisions.  

  4.  Arbitration
Proceedings . Arbitration between the parties will be subject to the following:  

  4.1  Initiation
of Arbitration . Pursuant to Section 110 of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that a party may initiate Arbitration by
giving written notice to the other party (  Arbitration Notice  ) in the same manner that notice is permitted
under Section 9.13 of the Agreement;  provided, however , that the Arbitration Notice may not be given by email or fax. Arbitration
will be deemed initiated as of the date that the Arbitration Notice is deemed delivered to such other party under Section 9.13
of the Agreement (the   Service Date  ). After the Service Date, information may be delivered, and notices may
be given, by email or fax pursuant to Section 9.13 of the Agreement or any other method permitted thereunder. The Arbitration
Notice must describe the nature of the controversy, the remedies sought, and the election to commence Arbitration proceedings.
All Claims in the Arbitration Notice must be pleaded consistent with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.  

  4.2  Selection
and Payment of Arbitrator .  

   (a)
Within ten (10) calendar days after the Service Date, Investor shall select and submit to Company the names of three (3) arbitrators
that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services (http://www.utahadrservices.com) (such
three (3) designated persons hereunder are referred to herein as the   Proposed Arbitrators  ). For the avoidance
of doubt, each Proposed Arbitrator must be qualified as a  neutral  with Utah ADR Services. Within five (5) calendar
days after Investor has submitted to Company the names of the Proposed Arbitrators, Company must select, by written notice to
Investor, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions. If
Company fails to select one of the Proposed Arbitrators in writing within such 5-day period, then Investor may select the arbitrator
from the Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to Company.  

   (b)
If Investor fails to submit to Company the Proposed Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Service Date pursuant
to subparagraph (a) above, then Company may at any time prior to Investor so designating the Proposed Arbitrators, identify the
names of three (3) arbitrators that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Service by written
notice to Investor. Investor may then, within five (5) calendar days after Company has submitted notice of its Proposed Arbitrators
to Investor, select, by written notice to Company, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties
under these Arbitration Provisions. If Investor fails to select in writing and within such 5-day period one (1) of the three (3)
Proposed Arbitrators selected by Company, then Company may select the arbitrator from its three (3) previously selected Proposed
Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to Investor.  

   (c)
If a Proposed Arbitrator chosen to serve as arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the party
that selected such Proposed Arbitrator may select one (1) of the other three (3) Proposed Arbitrators within three (3) calendar
days of the date the chosen Proposed Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as arbitrator. If
all three (3) Proposed Arbitrators decline or are otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the arbitrator selection process
shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 4.2.  

   (d)
The date that the Proposed Arbitrator selected pursuant to this Paragraph 4.2 agrees in writing (including via email) delivered
to both parties to serve as the arbitrator hereunder is referred to herein as the   Arbitration Commencement Date  .
If an arbitrator resigns or is unable to act during the Arbitration, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with
this Paragraph 4.2 to continue the Arbitration. If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list of neutrals and there
is no successor thereto, then the arbitrator shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association.  

   (e)
Subject to Paragraph 4.10 below, the cost of the arbitrator must be paid equally by both parties. Subject to Paragraph 4.10 below,
if one party refuses or fails to pay its portion of the arbitrator fee, then the other party can advance such unpaid amount (subject
to the accrual of Default Interest thereupon), with such amount being added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Arbitration
Award.  

  4.3  Applicability
of Certain Utah Rules . The parties agree that the Arbitration shall be conducted generally in accordance with the Utah Rules
of Civil Procedure and the Utah Rules of Evidence. More specifically, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply, without limitation,
to the filing of any pleadings, motions or memoranda, the conducting of discovery, and the taking of any depositions. The Utah
Rules of Evidence shall apply to any hearings, whether telephonic or in person, held by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is the parties  intent that the incorporation of such rules will in no event supersede these Arbitration Provisions.
In the event of any conflict between the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or the Utah Rules of Evidence and these Arbitration Provisions,
these Arbitration Provisions shall control.  

  4.4  Answer
and Default . An answer and any counterclaims to the Arbitration Notice shall be required to be delivered to the party initiating
the Arbitration within twenty (20) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date. If an answer is not delivered by the
required deadline, the arbitrator must provide written notice to the defaulting party stating that the arbitrator will enter a
default award against such party if such party does not file an answer within five (5) calendar days of receipt of such notice.
If an answer is not filed within the five (5) day extension period, the arbitrator must render a default award, consistent with
the relief requested in the Arbitration Notice, against a party that fails to submit an answer within such time period.  

  4.5  Related
Litigation . The party that delivers the Arbitration Notice to the other party shall have the option to also commence concurrent
legal proceedings with any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah (  Litigation Proceedings  ),
subject to the following: (a) the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings is to be substantially similar to the claims set forth
in the Arbitration Notice, provided that an additional cause of action to compel arbitration will also be included therein, (b)
so long as the other party files an answer to the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings and an answer to the Arbitration Notice,
the Litigation Proceedings will be stayed pending an Arbitration Award (or Appeal Panel Award (defined below), as applicable)
hereunder, (c) if the other party fails to file an answer in the Litigation Proceedings or an answer in the Arbitration proceedings,
then the party initiating Arbitration shall be entitled to a default judgment consistent with the relief requested, to be entered
in the Litigation Proceedings, and (d) any legal or procedural issue arising under the Arbitration Act that requires a decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction may be determined in the Litigation Proceedings. Any award of the arbitrator (or of the Appeal
Panel (defined below)) may be entered in such Litigation Proceedings pursuant to the Arbitration Act.  

  4.6  Discovery .
Pursuant to Section 118(8) of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that discovery shall be conducted as follows:  

   (a)
Written discovery will only be allowed if the likely benefits of the proposed written discovery outweigh the burden or expense
thereof, and the written discovery sought is likely to reveal information that will satisfy a specific element of a claim or defense
already pleaded in the Arbitration. The party seeking written discovery shall always have the burden of showing that all of the
standards and limitations set forth in these Arbitration Provisions are satisfied. The scope of discovery in the Arbitration proceedings
shall also be limited as follows:  

  (i) To
facts directly connected with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.  

  (ii) To
facts and information that cannot be obtained from another source or in another manner that is more convenient, less burdensome
or less expensive than in the manner requested.  

   (b)
No party shall be allowed (i) more than fifteen (15) interrogatories (including discrete subparts), (ii) more than fifteen (15)
requests for admission (including discrete subparts), (iii) more than ten (10) document requests (including discrete subparts),
or (iv) more than three (3) depositions (excluding expert depositions) for a maximum of seven (7) hours per deposition. The costs
associated with depositions will be borne by the party taking the deposition. The party defending the deposition will submit a
notice to the party taking the deposition of the estimated attorneys  fees that such party expects to incur in connection
with defending the deposition. If the party defending the deposition fails to submit an estimate of attorneys  fees within
five (5) calendar days of its receipt of a deposition notice, then such party shall be deemed to have waived its right to the
estimated attorneys  fees. The party taking the deposition must pay the party defending the deposition the estimated attorneys 
fees prior to taking the deposition, unless such obligation is deemed to be waived as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.
If the party taking the deposition believes that the estimated attorneys  fees are unreasonable, such party may submit the
issue to the arbitrator for a decision. All depositions will be taken in Utah.  

   (c)
All discovery requests (including document production requests included in deposition notices) must be submitted in writing to
the arbitrator and the other party. The party submitting the written discovery requests must include with such discovery requests
a detailed explanation of how the proposed discovery requests satisfy the requirements of these Arbitration Provisions and the
Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The receiving party will then be allowed, within five (5) calendar days of receiving the proposed
discovery requests, to submit to the arbitrator an estimate of the attorneys  fees and costs associated with responding
to such written discovery requests and a written challenge to each applicable discovery request. After receipt of an estimate
of attorneys  fees and costs and/or challenge(s) to one or more discovery requests, consistent with subparagraph (c) above,
the arbitrator will within three (3) calendar days make a finding as to the likely attorneys  fees and costs associated
with responding to the discovery requests and issue an order that (i) requires the requesting party to prepay the attorneys 
fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests, and (ii) requires the responding party to respond to the
discovery requests as limited by the arbitrator within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator s finding with respect
to such discovery requests. If a party entitled to submit an estimate of attorneys  fees and costs and/or a challenge to
discovery requests fails to do so within such 5-day period, the arbitrator will make a finding that (A) there are no attorneys 
fees or costs associated with responding to such discovery requests, and (B) the responding party must respond to such discovery
requests (as may be limited by the arbitrator) within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator s finding with respect
to such discovery requests. Any party submitting any written discovery requests, including without limitation interrogatories,
requests for production subpoenas to a party or a third party, or requests for admissions, must prepay the estimated attorneys 
fees and costs, before the responding party has any obligation to produce or respond to the same, unless such obligation is deemed
waived as set forth above.  

   (d)
In order to allow a written discovery request, the arbitrator must find that the discovery request satisfies the standards set
forth in these Arbitration Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator must strictly enforce these standards.
If a discovery request does not satisfy any of the standards set forth in these Arbitration Provisions or the Utah Rules of Civil
Procedure, the arbitrator may modify such discovery request to satisfy the applicable standards, or strike such discovery request
in whole or in part.  

   (e)
Each party may submit expert reports (and rebuttals thereto), provided that such reports must be submitted within sixty (60) days
of the Arbitration Commencement Date. Each party will be allowed a maximum of two (2) experts. Expert reports must contain the
following: (i) a complete statement of all opinions the expert will offer at trial and the basis and reasons for them; (ii) the
expert s name and qualifications, including a list of all the expert s publications within the preceding ten (10)
years, and a list of any other cases in which the expert has testified at trial or in a deposition or prepared a report within
the preceding ten (10) years; and (iii) the compensation to be paid for the expert s report and testimony. The parties are
entitled to depose any other party s expert witness one (1) time for no more than four (4) hours. An expert may not testify
in a party s case-in-chief concerning any matter not fairly disclosed in the expert report.  

  4.6  Dispositive
Motions . Each party shall have the right to submit dispositive motions pursuant Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the Utah Rules of Civil
Procedure (a   Dispositive Motion  ). The party submitting the Dispositive Motion may, but is not required to,
deliver to the arbitrator and to the other party a memorandum in support (the   Memorandum in Support  ) of the
Dispositive Motion. Within seven (7) calendar days of delivery of the Memorandum in Support, the other party shall deliver to
the arbitrator and to the other party a memorandum in opposition to the Memorandum in Support (the   Memorandum in Opposition  ).
Within seven (7) calendar days of delivery of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the party that submitted the Memorandum
in Support shall deliver to the arbitrator and to the other party a reply memorandum to the Memorandum in Opposition (  Reply
Memorandum  ). If the applicable party shall fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required above, or if the
other party fails to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required above, then the applicable party shall lose its right to so deliver
the same, and the Dispositive Motion shall proceed regardless.  

  4.7  Confidentiality .
All information disclosed by either party (or such party s agents) during the Arbitration process (including without limitation
information disclosed during the discovery process or any Appeal (defined below)) shall be considered confidential in nature.
Each party agrees not to disclose any confidential information received from the other party (or its agents) during the Arbitration
process (including without limitation during the discovery process or any Appeal) unless (a) prior to or after the time of disclosure
such information becomes public knowledge or part of the public domain, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving
party or its agents, (b) such information is required by a court order, subpoena or similar legal duress to be disclosed if such
receiving party has notified the other party thereof in writing and given it a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order
from a court of competent jurisdiction prior to disclosure, or (c) such information is disclosed to the receiving party s
agents, representatives and legal counsel on a need to know basis who each agree in writing not to disclose such information to
any third party. Pursuant to Section 118(5) of the Arbitration Act, the arbitrator is hereby authorized and directed to issue
a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information and confidential information upon the written request of
either party.  

  4.8  Authorization;
Timing; Scheduling Order . Subject to all other portions of these Arbitration Provisions, the parties hereby authorize and
direct the arbitrator to take such actions and make such rulings as may be necessary to carry out the parties  intent for
the Arbitration proceedings to be efficient and expeditious. Pursuant to Section 120 of the Arbitration Act, the parties hereby
agree that an Arbitration Award must be made within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement
Date. The arbitrator is hereby authorized and directed to hold a scheduling conference within ten (10) calendar days after the
Arbitration Commencement Date in order to establish a scheduling order with various binding deadlines for discovery, expert testimony,
and the submission of documents by the parties to enable the arbitrator to render a decision prior to the end of such 120-day
period.  

  4.9  Relief .
The arbitrator shall have the right to award or include in the Arbitration Award (or in a preliminary ruling) any relief which
the arbitrator deems proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief,
provided that the arbitrator may not award exemplary or punitive damages.  

  4.10  Fees
and Costs . As part of the Arbitration Award, the arbitrator is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being
awarded the least amount of money by the arbitrator, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to
any statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) to (a) pay the full amount of any unpaid costs and
fees of the Arbitration, and (b) reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable attorneys  fees, arbitrator costs and
fees, deposition costs, other discovery costs, and other expenses, costs or fees paid or otherwise incurred by the prevailing
party in connection with the Arbitration.  

  5.  Arbitration
Appeal .  

  5.1  Initiation
of Appeal.  Following the entry of the Arbitration Award, either party (the   Appellant  ) shall have a period
of thirty (30) calendar days in which to notify the other party (the   Appellee  ), in writing, that the Appellant
elects to appeal (the   Appeal  ) the Arbitration Award (such notice, an   Appeal Notice  )
to a panel of arbitrators as provided in Paragraph 5.2 below. The date the Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee
is referred to herein as the   Appeal Date  . The Appeal Notice must be delivered to the Appellee in accordance
with the provisions of Paragraph 4.1 above with respect to delivery of an Arbitration Notice. In addition, together with delivery
of the Appeal Notice to the Appellee, the Appellant must also pay for (and provide proof of such payment to the Appellee together
with delivery of the Appeal Notice) a bond in the amount of 110% of the sum the Appellant owes to the Appellee as a result of
the Arbitration Award the Appellant is appealing. In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together
with proof of payment of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1, the Appeal will occur as
a matter of right and, except as specifically set forth herein, will not be further conditioned. In the event a party does not
deliver an Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline prescribed
in this Paragraph 5.1, such party shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration Award. If no party delivers an Appeal Notice
(along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline described in this Paragraph 5.1, the
Arbitration Award shall be final. The parties acknowledge and agree that any Appeal shall be deemed part of the parties 
agreement to arbitrate for purposes of these Arbitration Provisions and the Arbitration Act.  

  5.2  Selection
and Payment of Appeal Panel.  In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with proof of payment
of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of Paragraph 5.1 above, the Appeal will be heard by a three (3) person
arbitration panel (the   Appeal Panel  ).  

   (a)
 Within ten (10) calendar days after the Appeal Date, the Appellee shall select and submit to the Appellant the names of five
(5) arbitrators that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services (http://www.utahadrservices.com)
(such five (5) designated persons hereunder are referred to herein as the   Proposed Appeal Arbitrators  ). For
the avoidance of doubt, each Proposed Appeal Arbitrator must be qualified as a  neutral  with Utah ADR Services, and
shall not be the arbitrator who rendered the Arbitration Award being appealed (the   Original Arbitrator  ).
Within five (5) calendar days after the Appellee has submitted to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators,
the Appellant must select, by written notice to the Appellee, three (3) of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators to act as the members
of the Appeal Panel. If the Appellant fails to select three (3) of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators in writing within such 5-day
period, then the Appellee may select such three (3) arbitrators from the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators by providing written notice
of such selection to the Appellant.  

   (b)
 If the Appellee fails to submit to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days
after the Appeal Date pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, then the Appellant may at any time prior to the Appellee so designating
the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators, identify the names of five (5) arbitrators that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified
arbitrators by Utah ADR Service (none of whom may be the Original Arbitrator) by written notice to the Appellee. The Appellee
may then, within five (5) calendar days after the Appellant has submitted notice of its selected arbitrators to the Appellee,
select, by written notice to the Appellant, three (3) of such selected arbitrators to serve on the Appeal Panel. If the Appellee
fails to select in writing within such 5-day period three (3) of the arbitrators selected by the Appellant to serve as the members
of the Appeal Panel, then the Appellant may select the three (3) members of the Appeal Panel from the Appellant s list of
five (5) arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to the Appellee.  

   (c)
 If a selected Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve, then the party that selected such Proposed
Appeal Arbitrator may select one (1) of the other five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days
of the date a chosen Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as an arbitrator.
If at least three (3) of the five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators decline or are otherwise unable to serve, then the
Proposed Appeal Arbitrator selection process shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 5.2;  provided, however ,
that any Proposed Appeal Arbitrators who have already agreed to serve shall remain on the Appeal Panel.  

   (d) The
date that all three (3) Proposed Appeal Arbitrators selected pursuant to this Paragraph 5.2 agree in writing (including via email)
delivered to both the Appellant and the Appellee to serve as members of the Appeal Panel hereunder is referred to herein as the
  Appeal Commencement Date  . No later than five (5) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellee
shall designate in writing (including via email) to the Appellant and the Appeal Panel the name of one (1) of the three (3) members
of the Appeal Panel to serve as the lead arbitrator in the Appeal proceedings. Each member of the Appeal Panel shall be deemed
an arbitrator for purposes of these Arbitration Provisions and the Arbitration Act, provided that, in conducting the Appeal, the
Appeal Panel may only act or make determinations upon the approval or vote of no less than the majority vote of its members, as
announced or communicated by the lead arbitrator on the Appeal Panel.  If an arbitrator on
the Appeal Panel ceases or is unable to act during the Appeal proceedings, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance
with Paragraph 5.2 above to continue the Appeal as a member of the Appeal Panel.  If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or
to provide a list of neutrals, then the arbitrators for the Appeal Panel shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of
the American Arbitration Association.  

   (d)

   5.3  Appeal
Procedure.  The Appeal will be deemed an appeal of the entire Arbitration Award. In conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel
shall conduct a de novo review of all Claims described or otherwise set forth in the Arbitration Notice. Subject to the foregoing
and all other provisions of this Paragraph 5, the Appeal Panel shall conduct the Appeal in a manner the Appeal Panel considers
appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the Appeal, may hold one or more hearings and permit oral argument, and
may review all previous evidence and discovery, together with all briefs, pleadings and other documents filed with the Original
Arbitrator (as well as any documents filed with the Appeal Panel pursuant to Paragraph 5.4(a) below). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in connection with the Appeal, the Appeal Panel shall not permit the parties to conduct any additional discovery or raise any
new Claims to be arbitrated, shall not permit new witnesses or affidavits, and shall not base any of its findings or determinations
on the Original Arbitrator s findings or the Arbitration Award.

documents filed with the Original Arbitrator (which material Appellee shall have the right to review and supplement if necessary),
and (ii) may, but is not required to, deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Memorandum in Support of the Appellant s
arguments concerning or position with respect to all Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded in the
Arbitration. Within seven (7) calendar days of the Appellant s delivery of the Memorandum in Support, as applicable, the
Appellee shall deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellant a Memorandum in Opposition to the Memorandum in Support. Within
seven (7) calendar days of the Appellee s delivery of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the Appellant shall deliver
to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Reply Memorandum to the Memorandum in Opposition. If the Appellant shall fail to substantially
comply with the requirements of clause (i) of this subparagraph (a), the Appellant shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration
Award, and the Arbitration Award shall be final. If the Appellee shall fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required
above, or if the Appellant shall fail to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required above, then the Appellee or the Appellant, as
the case may be, shall lose its right to so deliver the same, and the Appeal shall proceed regardless.  

  (b)
 Subject to subparagraph (a) above, the parties hereby agree that the Appeal must be heard by the Appeal Panel within thirty
(30) calendar days of the Appeal Commencement Date, and that the Appeal Panel must render its decision within thirty (30) calendar
days after the Appeal is heard (and in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date).  

   5.5  Appeal
Panel Award.  The Appeal Panel shall issue its decision (the   Appeal Panel Award  ) through the lead arbitrator
on the Appeal Panel. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Appeal Panel Award shall (a) supersede in its entirety

proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief, provided that the Appeal
Panel may not award exemplary or punitive damages.  

   5.7  Fees
and Costs.  As part of the Appeal Panel Award, the Appeal Panel is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being

fees, or other charges awarded to any part) the reasonable attorneys  fees, arbitrator and Appeal Panel costs and fees,

EXHIBIT 10.20  

THIS WARRANT AND THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE
HEREUNDER HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THIS WARRANT AND THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE HEREUNDER
MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THIS WARRANT
OR ANY SHARES ISSUABLE HEREUNDER UNDER SUCH ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO AGRITEK HOLDINGS, INC. OR ITS TRANSFER AGENT THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED. 

AGRITEK HOLDINGS, INC. 

WARRANT #1 TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 

1.  
  Issuance . For good and valuable consideration as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below), including
without limitation the Initial Cash Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged by  Agritek Holdings, Inc. , a Delaware corporation (  Company  );
 St. George Investments LLC , a Utah limited liability company, its successors and/or
registered assigns (  Investor  ), is hereby granted the right to purchase at any time on or after the Issue Date
(as defined below) until the date which is the last calendar day of the month in which the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date
occurs (the   Expiration Date  ), a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares (the   Warrant Shares  )
of Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the   Common Stock  ), equal to $57,500.00 divided
by the Market Price (as of the Issue Date), as such number may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Warrant #1 to Purchase Shares of Common Stock (this   Warrant  ). 

 This Warrant is
being issued pursuant to the terms of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated October 31, 2016, to which Company and Investor
are parties (as the same may be amended from time to time, the   Purchase Agreement  ). Certain capitalized terms
used herein are defined in  Attachment 1  attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Moreover, to the extent
any defined terms herein are defined in any other Transaction Document (as so noted herein), such defined term shall remain applicable
in this Warrant even if the other Transaction Document has been released, satisfied, or is otherwise cancelled. 

 This Warrant was
issued to Investor on October 31, 2016 (the   Issue Date  ). For the avoidance of doubt, the Initial Cash Purchase
Price constitutes payment in full for this Warrant. 

 2.  
  Exercise of Warrant . 

 2.1.  
  General . 

 (a)  
 This Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time and from time to time commencing on the Issue Date and ending
on the Expiration Date. Such exercise shall be effectuated by submitting to Company (either by delivery to Company or by email
or facsimile transmission) a completed and signed Notice of Exercise substantially in the form attached to this Warrant as  Exhibit
A  (the   Notice of Exercise  ). The date a Notice of Exercise is either faxed, emailed or delivered to Company
shall be the   Exercise Date ,  provided that, if such exercise represents the full exercise of the outstanding
balance of this Warrant, Investor shall tender this Warrant to Company within five (5) Trading Days thereafter, but only if the
Delivery Shares to be delivered pursuant to the Notice of Exercise have been delivered to Investor as of such date. The Notice
of Exercise shall be executed by Investor and shall indicate (i) the number of Delivery Shares to be issued pursuant to such exercise,
and (ii) if applicable (as provided below), whether the exercise is a cashless exercise. 

 (b)  
 Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary, at any time prior
to the Expiration Date, Investor may elect a  cashless  exercise of this Warrant for any Warrant Shares whereby Investor
shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the excess of the Current Market Value over the aggregate
Exercise Price of the Exercise Shares, divided by (ii) the Adjusted Price. 

 (c)  
 If the Notice of Exercise form elects a  cash  exercise, the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for the
Delivery Shares shall be payable, at the election of Investor, in cash or by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer
in accordance with instructions provided by Company at the request of Investor. 

 (d)  
 Upon the appropriate payment to Company, if any, of the Exercise Price for the Delivery Shares, Company shall promptly,
but in no case later than the date that is three (3) Trading Days following the date the Exercise Price is paid to Company (or
with respect to a  cashless exercise,  the date that is three (3) Trading Days following the Exercise Date) (the   Delivery
Date  ), deliver or cause Company s Transfer Agent to deliver the applicable Delivery Shares electronically via
the DWAC system to the account designated by Investor on the Notice of Exercise. If for any reason Company is not able to so deliver
the Delivery Shares via the DWAC system, notwithstanding its best efforts to do so, such shall constitute a breach of this Warrant,
and Company shall instead, on or before the applicable date set forth above in this subsection, issue and deliver to Investor or
its broker (as designated in the Notice of Exercise), via reputable overnight courier, a certificate, registered in the name of
Investor or its designee, representing the applicable number of Delivery Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, Company has not met
its obligation to deliver Delivery Shares within the required timeframe set forth above unless Investor or its broker, as applicable,
has actually received the Delivery Shares (whether electronically or in certificated form) no later than the close of business
on the latest possible delivery date pursuant to the terms set forth above. Moreover, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Transaction Document, in the event Company or its Transfer Agent refuses to deliver any Delivery Shares
to Investor on grounds that such issuance is in violation of Rule 144 under the 1933 Act (as defined below) (  Rule 144  ),
Company shall deliver or cause its Transfer Agent to deliver the applicable Delivery Shares to Investor with a restricted securities
legend, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d). In conjunction therewith, Company will also deliver
to Investor a written opinion from its counsel or its Transfer Agent s counsel opining as to why the issuance of the applicable
Delivery Shares violates Rule 144. 

 (e)  
 If Delivery Shares are delivered later than as required under subsection (d) immediately above, Company agrees to pay, in
addition to all other remedies available to Investor in the Transaction Documents, a late charge equal to the greater of (i) $500.00
and (ii) 2% of the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock not issued to Investor on a timely basis and to which Investor
is entitled multiplied by (2) the Closing Trade Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the last
possible date which Company could have issued such shares of Common Stock to Investor without violating this Warrant, rounded to
the nearest multiple of $100.00 (such resulting amount, the   Warrant Share Value  ) (but in any event the cumulative
amount of such late fees for each exercise shall not exceed 200% of the Warrant Share Value), per Trading Day until such Warrant
Shares are delivered (the   Late Fees  ). Company acknowledges and agrees that the failure to timely deliver Delivery
Shares hereunder is a material breach of this Warrant and that the Late Fees are properly charged as liquidated damages to compensate
Investor for such breach. Company shall pay any Late Fees incurred under this subsection in immediately available funds upon demand;
 provided, however , that, so long as the Note is outstanding, at the option of Investor, such amount owed may be added to
the principal amount of the Note. Furthermore, in the event that Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Delivery
Shares as required under subsection (d) immediately above, Investor may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by
delivery of a notice to such effect to Company, whereupon Company and Investor shall each be restored to their respective positions
immediately prior to the exercise of the relevant portion of this Warrant, except that the Late Fees described above shall be payable
through the date notice of revocation or rescission is given to Company. Finally, in the event Company fails to deliver any Delivery
Shares to Investor for a period of ninety (90) days from the Delivery Date, Investor may elect, in its sole discretion, to stop
the accumulation of the Late Fees as of such date and require Company to pay to Investor a cash amount equal to (i) the total amount
of all Late Fees that have accumulated prior to the date of Investor s election, plus (ii) the product of the number of Delivery
Shares deliverable to Investor on such date if it were to exercise this Warrant with respect to the remaining number of Exercise
Shares as of such date multiplied by the Closing Trade Price of the Common Stock on the Delivery Date (the   Cash Settlement
Amount  ). At such time as Investor makes an election to require Company to pay to it the Cash Settlement Amount, such
obligation of Company shall be a valid and binding obligation of Company and shall for all purposes be deemed to be a debt obligation
of Company owed to Investor as of the date it makes such election. Upon Company s payment of the Cash Settlement Amount to
Investor, this Warrant shall be deemed to have been satisfied. In addition, and for the avoidance of doubt, even if Company could
not deliver the number of Delivery Shares deliverable to Investor if it were to exercise this Warrant with respect to the remaining
number of Exercise Shares on the date of repayment due to the provisions of Section 2.2, the provisions of Section 2.2 will not
apply with respect to Company s payment of the Cash Settlement Amount. 

 (f)  
 Investor shall be deemed to be the holder of the Delivery Shares (not including any Ownership Limitation Shares (as defined
below)) issuable to it in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1 on the Exercise Date. 

 2.2.  
  Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant or the other Transaction
Documents, if at any time Investor shall or would be issued shares of Common Stock, but such issuance would cause Investor (together
with its affiliates) to own a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date
(the   Maximum Percentage  ), Company must not issue to Investor shares of Common Stock which would exceed the
Maximum Percentage. The shares of Common Stock issuable to Investor that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are
referred to herein as the   Ownership   Limitation   Shares  . In such event, Company shall reserve
the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of Investor. From time to time, Investor may notify Company in writing
of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to Investor without causing Investor to exceed the Maximum
Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Company shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated shares
to Investor, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
term  4.99%  above shall be replaced with  9.99%  at such time as the Market Capitalization is less than
$10,000,000.00. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the term  4.99%  is replaced with  9.99% 
pursuant to the preceding sentence, such change to  9.99%  shall be permanent. By written notice to Company, Investor
may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the 61st day
after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall apply
to all affiliates and assigns of Investor. 

 3.  
  Mutilation or Loss of Warrant . Upon receipt by Company of evidence satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation of this Warrant, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) receipt of reasonably satisfactory indemnification,
and (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, Company will execute and deliver to Investor a
new Warrant of like tenor and date and any such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant shall thereupon become void. 

 4.  
  Rights of Investor . Investor shall not, by virtue of this Warrant alone, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder
in Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of Investor with respect to or arising under this Warrant are limited to
those expressed in this Warrant and are not enforceable against Company except to the extent set forth herein. 

 5.  
  Protection Against Dilution and Other Adjustments . 

 5.1.  
  Capital Adjustments . If Company shall at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant subdivide the Common Stock,
by split-up or stock split, or otherwise, or combine its Common Stock, or issue additional shares of its Common Stock as a dividend,
the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall forthwith be automatically increased proportionately
in the case of a subdivision, split or stock dividend, or proportionately decreased in the case of a combination. Appropriate adjustments
shall also be made to the Exercise Price and other applicable amounts, but the aggregate purchase price payable for the total number
of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant (as adjusted) shall remain the same. Any adjustment under this Section 5.1
shall become effective automatically at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective, or
as of the record date of such dividend, or in the event that no record date is fixed, upon the making of such dividend. 

 5.2.  
  Reclassification, Reorganization and Consolidation . In case of any reclassification, capital reorganization, or change
in the capital stock of Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination, or stock dividend provided for in Section 5.1
above), then Company shall make appropriate provision so that Investor shall have the right at any time prior to the expiration
of this Warrant to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares
of stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with such reclassification, reorganization, or change by a
holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock as were purchasable by Investor immediately prior to such reclassification,
reorganization, or change. In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of Investor
so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities and property
deliverable upon exercise hereof, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the purchase price per Warrant Share payable hereunder,
provided the aggregate purchase price shall remain the same. 

 5.3.  
  Subsequent Equity Sales . If Company or any subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time and from time to time while
this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose
of, sell or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition of) any Common Stock (including
any Common Stock issued under the Note, whether upon any type of conversion or any Deemed Issuance), debt, warrants, options, preferred
shares or other instruments or securities which are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock (together herein
referred to as   Equity Securities  ), at an effective price per share less than the Exercise Price (such lower
price, the   Base Share Price  , and any such issuance, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (if the holder
of the Common Stock or Equity Securities so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset
provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options, or rights per share which
are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that
is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of
the Dilutive Issuance), then (a) the Exercise Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price, and (b) the
number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to an amount equal to the number of Warrant
Shares Investor could purchase hereunder for an aggregate Exercise Price, as reduced pursuant to subsection (a) above, equal to
the aggregate Exercise Price payable immediately prior to such reduction in Exercise Price, provided that the increase in the number
of Exercise Shares issuable under this Warrant made pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall not at any time exceed a number equal to
three (3) times the number of Exercise Shares issuable under this Warrant as of the Issue Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing cap on the number of Exercise Shares issuable hereunder shall only apply to adjustments made pursuant to this Section
5.3 and shall not apply to adjustments made pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.2 or any other section of this Warrant). Such adjustments
shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Equity Securities are issued. Company shall notify Investor, in writing, no later than
the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Equity Securities subject to this Section 5.3, indicating therein
the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price, or other pricing terms (such notice,
the   Dilutive   Issuance Notice  ). Dilutive Issuance Notices shall be in the form set forth in Section
6 below. For purposes of clarification, whether or not Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5.3,
upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, Investor is entitled to receive the increased
number of Warrant Shares provided for in subsection (b) above at an Exercise Price equal to the Base Share Price regardless of
whether Investor accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise. Additionally, following the occurrence of
a Dilutive Issuance, all references in this Warrant to  Warrant Shares  shall be a reference to the Warrant Shares
as increased pursuant to subsection (b) above, and all references in this Warrant to  Exercise Price  shall be a reference
to the Exercise Price as reduced pursuant to subsection (a) above, as the same may occur from time to time hereunder. 

 5.4.  
  Exceptions to Adjustment . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3, no adjustment to the Exercise Price shall
be effected as a result of an Excepted Issuance. 

 6.  
  Certificate as to Adjustments . In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the number or kind of shares issuable
on the exercise of this Warrant, or in the Exercise Price, pursuant to the terms hereof, Company at its expense will promptly cause
its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
of this Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by Company for
any additional shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received
upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as
provided in this Warrant. Nothing in this Section 6 shall be deemed to limit any other provision contained herein. 

 7.  
  Transfer to Comply with the Securities Act . This Warrant and the Warrant Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   1933 Act  ). Neither this Warrant nor the Warrant Shares may be sold,
transferred, pledged or hypothecated without (a) an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act relating to such security
or (b) an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Company that registration is not required under the 1933 Act;  provided,
however , that the foregoing restrictions on transfer shall not apply to the transfer of the Warrant to an affiliate of Investor.
Until such time as registration has occurred under the 1933 Act, each certificate for this Warrant and any Warrant Shares shall
contain a legend, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for Company, setting forth the restrictions on transfer contained
in this Section 7;  provided, however , that Company acknowledges and agrees that any such legend shall be removed from all
certificates for DTC Eligible Common Stock delivered hereunder as such Common Stock is cleared and converted into electronic shares
by the DTC, and nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to the contrary. Upon receipt of a duly executed assignment of this
Warrant, Company shall register the transferee thereon as the new holder on the books and records of Company and such transferee
shall be deemed a  registered holder  or  registered assign  for all purposes hereunder, and shall have
all the rights of Investor under this Warrant. Until this Warrant is transferred on the books of Company, Company may treat Investor
as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 

 8.  
  Notices . Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in the manner provided in the subsection titled
 Notices  in the Purchase Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. 

 9.  
  Supplements and Amendments; Whole Agreement . This Warrant may be amended or supplemented only by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. This Warrant, together with the Purchase Agreement, contains the full understanding of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and there are no representations, warranties, agreements or
understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof other than as expressly contained herein and therein. 

 10.  
  Purchase Agreement; Arbitration of Disputes; Calculation Disputes . This Warrant is subject to the terms, conditions
and general provisions of the Purchase Agreement, including without limitation the Arbitration Provisions (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) set forth as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding the Arbitration Provisions, in the case
of a dispute as to any Calculation (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), such dispute will be resolved in the manner set forth
in the Purchase Agreement. 

 11.  
  Governing Law; Venue . This Warrant shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Warrant shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State
of Utah, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. The provisions set
forth in the Purchase Agreement to determine the proper venue for any disputes are incorporated herein by this reference. 

 12.  
  Waiver of Jury Trial . COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS WARRANT OR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY.
THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE, LAW, RULE
OR REGULATION. FURTHER, COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING ITS RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY. 

 13.  
  Remedies . The remedies at law of Investor under this Warrant in the event of any default or threatened default by
Company in the performance of or compliance with any of the terms of this Warrant are not and will not be adequate and, without
limiting any other remedies available to Investor in the Transaction Documents, at law or equity, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, such terms may be specifically enforced by a decree for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or by
an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or otherwise without the obligation to post a bond. 

 14.  
  Liquidated Damages . Company and Investor agree that in the event Company fails to comply with any of the terms or
provisions of this Warrant, Investor s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate
because of the parties  inability to predict future interest rates, future share prices, future trading volumes and other
relevant factors. Accordingly, Investor and Company agree that any fees or other charges assessed under this Warrant are not penalties
but instead are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Investor s and Company s
expectations that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Issue Date for purposes of determining the holding period under
Rule 144. 

 15.  
  Counterparts . This Warrant may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for
all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
Signatures delivered via facsimile or email shall be considered original signatures for all purposes hereof. 

 16.  
  Attorneys  Fees . In the event of any arbitration, litigation or dispute arising from this Warrant, the parties
agree that the party who is awarded the most money (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any
statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) shall be deemed the prevailing party for all purposes
and shall therefore be entitled to an additional award of the full amount of the attorneys  fees and expenses paid by
said prevailing party in connection with arbitration or litigation without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual
claims or defenses giving rise to the fees and expenses. Nothing herein shall restrict or impair an arbitrator s
or a court s power to award fees and expenses for frivolous or bad faith pleading. 

 17.  
  Severability . Whenever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective
and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
provision shall be modified to achieve the objective of the parties to the fullest extent permitted and such invalidity or unenforceability
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Warrant or the validity or enforceability of this Warrant
in any other jurisdiction. 

 18.

 Printed Name:  B. Michael Friedman  

 Title:  Chief Executive Officer  

ATTACHMENT 1   

   DEFINITIONS   

For purposes of
this Warrant, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

 A1.  
   Adjusted Price   means the lower of (i) the Exercise Price (as such Exercise Price may be adjusted from
time to time pursuant to the terms of this Warrant), and (ii) the Market Price. 

 A2.  
   Approved Stock Plan   means any stock option plan which has been approved by the board of directors of
Company and is in effect as of the Issue Date, pursuant to which Company s securities may be issued to any employee, officer
or director for services provided to Company. 

 A3.  
   Bloomberg   means Bloomberg L.P. (or if that service is not then reporting the relevant information regarding
the Common Stock, a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by Investor and reasonably satisfactory to Company). 

 A4.  
   Closing Bid Price   and   Closing Trade Price   means the last closing bid price and
last closing trade price, respectively, for the Common Stock on its principal market, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if its principal
market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not designate the closing bid price or the closing trade price (as
the case may be) then the last bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock prior to 4:00:00 p.m., New
York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if its principal market is not the principal securities exchange or trading market for
the Common Stock, the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock on the principal securities
exchange or trading market where the Common Stock is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg, or if the foregoing do not apply,
the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market on the electronic
bulletin board for the Common Stock as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, is
reported for the Common Stock by Bloomberg, the average of the bid prices, or the ask prices, respectively, of any market makers
for the Common Stock as reported by OTC Markets Group, Inc., and any successor thereto. If the Closing Bid Price or the Closing
Trade Price cannot be calculated for the Common Stock on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Bid Price
or the Closing Trade Price (as the case may be) of the Common Stock on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by Investor and Company. If Investor and Company are unable to agree upon the fair market value of the Common Stock, then such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures in the Purchase Agreement governing Calculations. All such determinations
shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during such
period. 

 A5.  
    Conversion Factor   means 60%, subject to the following adjustments.
If at any time the lowest intra-day trade price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding any date of measurement is
below $0.01, then in such event the then-current Conversion Factor shall be permanently reduced by 10% (subject to other reductions
set forth in this section). If at any time after the Issue Date, Company is not DWAC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion
Factor will automatically be permanently reduced by 5%. If at any time after the Issue Date, the Delivery Shares are not DTC Eligible,
then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be permanently reduced by an additional 5%. For example, the first time
Company is not DWAC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future exercises thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes
of this example. If, thereafter, the Delivery Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for all future exercises will
automatically be permanently reduced from 55% to 50% for purposes of this example.  

 A6.  
   Current Market Value   means an amount equal to the Trade Price multiplied by the number of Exercise
Shares specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. 

 A7.  
   Deemed Issuance   means an issuance of Common Stock that shall be deemed to have occurred on the latest
possible permitted date pursuant to the terms of this Warrant or the Note in the event Company fails to deliver shares of Common
Stock as and when required.

   DTC Eligible   means, with respect to the Common Stock, that such Common Stock is eligible to be deposited
in certificate form at the DTC, cleared and converted into electronic shares by the DTC and held in the name of the clearing firm

been approved (without revocation) by the DTC s underwriting department, (c) Company s transfer agent is approved as
an agent in the DTC/FAST Program, (d) the Delivery Shares are otherwise eligible for delivery via DWAC; (e) Company has previously
delivered all Delivery Shares to Investor via DWAC; and (f) Company s transfer agent does not have a policy prohibiting or
limiting delivery of the Delivery Shares via DWAC. 

 A14.  
   Excepted Issuances   means any shares of Common Stock, options, or convertible securities issued or issuable
in connection with any Approved Stock Plan;  provided that  the option term, exercise price or similar provisions of any issuance
pursuant to such Approved Stock Plan are not amended, modified or changed on or after the Issue Date. 

 A15.  
   Exercise Price   means $0.05 per share of Common Stock, as the same may be adjusted from time to time
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Warrant. 

 A16.  
   Exercise Shares   means those Warrant Shares subject to an exercise of this Warrant by Investor. By way
of illustration only and without limiting the foregoing, if (i) this Warrant is initially exercisable for 4,180,000 Warrant Shares
and Investor has not previously exercised this Warrant, and (ii) Investor were to make a cashless exercise with respect to 5,000
Warrant Shares pursuant to which 6,000 Delivery Shares would be issuable to Investor, then (1) this Warrant shall be deemed to
have been exercised with respect to 5,000 Exercise Shares, (2) this Warrant would remain exercisable for 4,175,000 Warrant Shares,
and (3) this Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised with respect to 6,000 Delivery Shares. 

 A17.  
    Market Capitalization   means the product equal to (a) the average VWAP
of the Common Stock for the immediately preceding fifteen (15) Trading Days, multiplied by (b) the aggregate number of outstanding

 A18.  
   Market Price   means the Conversion Factor multiplied by the lowest intra-day trade price in the twenty
(20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable date of exercise.  By way of example only,
if the Conversion Factor were 75% and the average of the three lowest Closing Bid Prices in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately
preceding the applicable date of exercise were $1.00 then the Market Price would be $0.75 (75% x $1.00).  

 A19.  
   Note   means that certain Convertible Promissory Note issued by Company to Investor pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, and including any promissory note(s) that replace or are exchanged for
such referenced promissory note.

to time.
