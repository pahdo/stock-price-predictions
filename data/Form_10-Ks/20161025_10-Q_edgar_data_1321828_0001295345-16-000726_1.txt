   (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

   Organization, Ownership and Business   
	  Data Call Technologies, Inc. (the  Company ) was
	incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2002. The Company's
	mission is to integrate cutting-edge information delivery solutions that are
	currently deployed by the media, and put them within the control of retail
	and commercial enterprises. The Company's software and services put its
	clients in control of real-time advertising, news, and other content,
	including emergency alerts, within one building or 10,000, local or
	thousands of miles away.  
	  The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles
	( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
	10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
	required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
	management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
	considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
	results for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not
	indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
	31, 2016.  
	  As contemplated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(SEC) under Rules of Regulation S-X, the accompanying financial statements
	and related footnotes have been condensed and do not contain certain
	information that will be included in the Company's annual financial
	statements and footnotes thereto. For further information, refer to the
	Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes
	thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year
	ended December 31, 2015.  
	   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
	  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company
	considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no
	cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
	   Revenue Recognition   
	  The Company recognizes revenues based on monthly fees for
	services provided to customers. Some customers prepay for annual services
	and the Company defers such amounts and amortizes them into revenues as the
	service is provided.  
	   Accounts Receivable   
	  Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade
	receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful trade
	receivables equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. That estimate is
	based on historical collection experience, current economic and market
	conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade
	accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful trade receivables was $0 as
	of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as we believe all of our
	receivables are fully collectable.  
	   Property, Equipment and Depreciation   
	  Property and equipment are recorded at cost less
	accumulated depreciation. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets
	disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
	accounts, with any resultant gain or loss being recognized as a component of
	other income or expense. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful
	lives of the assets (3-5 years) using the straight-line method for financial
	reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
	Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  
	   Advertising Costs   
	  The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred.  
	   Research and Development   
	  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  
	   Product Development Costs   
	  Product development costs consist of cost incurred to
	develop the Company's website and software for internal and external use.
	All product development costs are expensed as incurred.  
	   Income Taxes   
	  The Company is a taxable entity and recognizes deferred
	tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to
	differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
	assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in
	effect when the temporary differences reverse. The effect on the deferred
	tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
	in the year that includes the enactment date of the rate change. A valuation
	allowance is used to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
	likely than not to be realized.  
	   Use of Estimates   
	  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	U. S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
	reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
	Actual results could vary from those estimates.  
	   Beneficial Conversion Feature   
	  Convertible debt includes conversion terms that are
	considered in the money compared to the market price of the stock on the
	date of the related agreement. The Company calculates the beneficial
	conversion feature and records a debt discount with the amount being
	amortized to interest expense over the term of the note.  
	   Management's Estimates and Assumptions   
	  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
	Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
	   Stock-Based Compensation   
	  We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
	 FASB ASC 718-10.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the
	period is based on the value of the portion of share-based awards that are
	ultimately expected to vest during the period. The fair value of each stock
	option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
	option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based
	on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the Company's
	common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for all share-based
	payment awards is recognized using the straight-line amortization method
	over the vesting period.  
	   Common Stock Split   
	  On September 13, 2016 we declared a reverse split of our
	common stock. The formula provided that every thirty (30) issued and
	outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation be automatically split
	into one (1) share of common stock. Except as otherwise noted, all share,
	option and warrant numbers have been restated to give retroactive effect to
	this split. All per share disclosures retroactively reflect post-split
	shares.  
	   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
	  The Company estimates the fair value of its financial
	instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation
	methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting
	market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the Company
	estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
	the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different
	market assumption and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect
	on the estimated fair value amounts. The interest rates payable by the
	Company on its notes payable approximate market rates. The Company believes
	that the fair value of its financial instruments comprising accounts
	receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, and notes payable
	approximate their carrying amounts.  
	  On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted an accounting
	standard for applying fair value measurements to certain assets, liabilities
	and transactions that are periodically measured at fair value. The adoption
	did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results
	of operations or cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to
	the accounting standards related to the measurement of liabilities that are
	routinely recognized or disclosed at fair value. This standard clarifies how
	a company should measure the fair value of liabilities, and that
	restrictions preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered
	as a factor in the measurement of liabilities within the scope of this
	standard. This standard became effective for the Company on October 1, 2009.
	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
	Company's financial statements. The fair value accounting standard creates a
	three level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation
	techniques to derive fair values. The basis for fair value measurements for
	each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the
	highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.  
	 
	  Level 1: Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
	  Level 2: Quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in
which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.  
	  Level 3: Valuations derived from
valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.  
	  The following table presents the
Company's Assets and Liabilities within the fair value hierarchy utilized to
measure fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
	 In August, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments(a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). Effective
	for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities,
	the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
	If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any
	adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that
	includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must
	adopt all of the amendments in the same period. 
	 In June, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial
	Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
	Financial Instruments. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities
	and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update are
	effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business
	entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those
	fiscal years. For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities and
	employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan
	accounting, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2021. All entities may adopt the amendments in
	this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 
	 In May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
	Practical Expedients. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in
	Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition
	requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective
	date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended
	by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers
	the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. 
	 In April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
	Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance
	in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
	Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and
	transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as
	the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other
	Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update
	2015-14,Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the
	Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. 
	 The Company has considered all new accounting
	pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that
	may have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, or
	cash flows, based on current information. 
	  (2) Related Party Transactions  
	 During the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued
	unregistered shares as follows: (i) 33,334 restricted shares to Jim Tevis,
	the Company's CTO, in connection with the execution of a new 2 year
	consulting agreement. The restricted shares were valued at $0.555 per share
	using the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. Total expense
	associated with the issuances is calculated at $18,500 to be recognized over
	the 2 year term of the agreement. The expense recognized in the nine months
	ended September 30, 2016 was $Nil. The expense recognized in the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015 was $6,919. 
	 During the first quarter of 2013, the Company issued
	unregistered shares as follows: (i) 250,000 restricted shares to Tim Vance,
	the Company's CEO, in connection with the execution of a new 5 year
	employment agreement; and 250,000 restricted shares to Gary Woerz, the
	Company's newly designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5
	year employment agreement. The restricted shares were valued at $1.80 per
	share using the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. Total
	expense associated with the issuances is calculated at $900,000 to be
	recognized over the 5 year term of the agreements. The expense recognized in
	the third quarter of 2016 was $44,805 (2015: $44,805) and $133,441 for the
	nine months ended September 30, 2016 (2015: $132,954). The January 2013
	employment agreements calls for a 5 year term ending January 30, 2018,
	annual compensation of $85,000 per year for services as CEO, annual
	compensation of $52,000 per year for services as CFO, 500,000 options to the
	CEO and 400,000 options to the CFO in addition to the 250,000 restricted
	shares to each the CEO and CFO. 
	 During the first quarter of 2014, the Company granted a

	new 5 year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, the Company's newly
	designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5 year employment
	agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to
	value stock options granted. The Black- Scholes model was developed for use
	in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
	restrictions and are fully transferable. The model requires management to
	make estimates, which are subjective and may not be representative of actual
	results. The Company recorded $Nil (September 30, 2015: $524) in stock
	option compensation expense, in relation to these options for the nine month
	period ended September 30, 2016. The Black-Scholes model calculations
	included stock price on date of measurement of $0.30, exercise price of
	$0.001, a term of 1.5 years, computed volatility of 348% and a discount rate
	of 0.27%. The January 2014 employment agreements calls for a 5 year term
	ending January 30, 2018, annual compensation of $85,000 per year for
	services as CEO, annual compensation of $52,000 per year for services as
	CFO, 500,000 options to the CEO and 400,000 options to the CFO in addition
	to the 250,000 restricted shares to each the CEO and CFO. 
	  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company granted
	a total of 900,000 options for the purchase of up to 900,000 shares of
	common stock to Tim Vance, the Company's CEO, in connection with the
	execution of a new 5 year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, the
	Company's newly designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5
	year employment agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option
	valuation model to value stock options granted. The Black- Scholes model was
	developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have
	no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The model requires
	management to make estimates, which are subjective and may not be
	representative of actual results. The Company recorded $266 (September 30,
	2015: $2,007) in stock option compensation expense, in relation to these
	options for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The
	Black-Scholes model calculations included stock price on date of measurement
	of $0.0036, exercise price of $0.001, a term of 1.5 years, computed
	volatility of 251% and a discount rate of 0.33%. The January 2015 employment
	agreements calls for a 5 year term ending January 30, 2018, annual
	compensation of $85,000 per year for services as CEO, annual compensation of
	$52,000 per year for services as CFO, 500,000 options to the CEO and 400,000
	options to the CFO in addition to the 250,000 restricted shares to each the
	CEO and CFO. 
	 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company granted a
	total of 900,000 options for the purchase of up to 900,000 shares of common
	stock to Tim Vance, the Company's CEO, in connection with the execution of a
	new 5 year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, the Company's newly
	designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5 year employment
	agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to
	value stock options granted. The Black- Scholes model was developed for use
	in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
	restrictions and are fully transferable. The model requires management to
	make estimates, which are subjective and may not be representative of actual
	results. The Company recorded $585 (September 30, 2015: $Nil) in stock
	option compensation expense, in relation to these options for the nine month
	period ended September 30, 2016. The Black-Scholes model calculations
	included stock price on date of measurement of $0.0014, exercise price of
	$0.001, a term of 3 years, computed volatility of 105% and a discount rate
	of 1.01%. The January 2016 employment agreements calls for a 5 year term

	to the 250,000 restricted shares to each the CEO and CFO. 
	 The Company issued a total of twelve million (400,000
	restricted shares) of the Company's common stock as follows: 200,000
	restricted shares in the name of Timothy E. Vance and 200,000 restricted
	shares in the name of Gary D. Woerz valued at $0.114 based upon services
	provided by the Executive officers in improving the Company's financial
	condition and operations and the shares will be subject to a holding period
	of eighteen months prior to their availability for resale pursuant to the
	provisions of Rule 144, and the Company determined that the Employment
	Agreements between the Company and its Executive Officers be amended to
	adjust the exercise price form the lower of $0.03 to $0.0015 and that the
	expiration date of the options to be extended from January 31, 2018 to
	December 31, 2019. The company expensed $Nil for the quarter ending

	shares of Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of which 800,000
	shares of Series A convertible preferred stock are outstanding at September
	30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or

	the Board of Directors, without further action by stockholders, and may
	include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular
	matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion,
	redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. 
	 On September 13, 2016 we declared a reverse split of our
	common stock. The formula provided that every thirty (30) issued and
	outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation be automatically split
	into one (1) share of common stock. Except as otherwise noted, all share,
	option and warrant numbers have been restated to give retroactive effect to
	this split. All per share disclosures retroactively reflect post-split
	shares. 
	 Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall bear a
	preferential dividend of twelve percent (12%) per year and is convertible
	into a number shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per
	share ( Common Stock ) based upon Fifty (50%) percent of the average closing
	bid price of the Common Stock During the ten (10) day period prior to the
	conversion. The Company has not declared or accrued any dividends and as of
	September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Unaccrued and undeclared dividends
	were $3,600 and $4,800 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,

	employment agreement; and 250,000 restricted shares to Gary Woerz, the
	Company's newly designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5
	year employment agreement. The restricted shares were valued at $1.80 per
	share using the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. Total
	expense associated with the issuances is calculated at $900,000 to be
	recognized over the 5 year term of the agreements. The expense recognized in
	the third quarter of 2016 was $44,805 (2015: $44,805) and $133,441 for the

	amended its Articles of incorporation to authorize 1,000,000 shares of
	Series B Preferred Stock at a par value of $0.001 and issued 10,000 shares.

	The Series B Preferred Stock may be issued to one or series by the terms of
	which may be and may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation,
	conversion, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The Series B
	Preferred Shares have the right to vote in the aggregate, on all shareholder
	matters votes equal to 51% of the total shareholder vote on any and all
	shareholder matters. The Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to this
	51% voting right no matter how many shares of common stock or other voting
	stock of Data Call Technology stock is issued and outstanding in the future. 
	 The Company issued a total of twelve million (400,000
	restricted shares) of the Company's common stock as follows: 200,000
	restricted shares in the name of Timothy E. Vance and 200,000 restricted

	condition and operations and the shares will be subject to a holding period
	of eighteen months prior to their availability for resale pursuant to the
	provisions of Rule 144, and the Company determined that the Employment
	Agreements between the Company and its Executive Officers be amended to
	adjust the exercise price form the lower of $0.03 to $0.0015 and that the
	expiration date of the options to be extended from January 31, 2018 to
	December 31, 2019. The company expensed $Nil for the quarter ending
	September 30, 2016 and $7,600 for the quarter ending September 30, 2015. The
	company expensed $15,200 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016
	and $22,800 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The total
	value of the 400,000 shares granted is $45,600. 
	 During the first quarter of 2016, the Company granted a
	total of 900,000 options for the purchase of up to 900,000 shares of common
	stock to Tim Vance, the Company's CEO, in connection with the execution of a
	new 5 year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, the Company's newly
	designated CFO, in connection with the execution of a new 5 year employment
	agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to
	value stock options granted. During the period ended March 31, 2015, the
	Company determined that the Employment Agreements between the Company and
	its Executive Officers be amended to adjust the exercise price form the
	lower of $0.03 to $0.0015 and that the expiration date of the options to be
	extended from January 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. The Black- Scholes
	model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
	that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The model
	requires management to make estimates, which are subjective and may not be
	representative of actual results. The Black-Scholes model calculations
	included stock price on date of measurement of $0.0014, exercise price of
	$0.001, a term of 3 years, computed volatility of 105% and a discount rate
	of 1.01%. Assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock based
	compensation is as follows: 

The Company recorded $585 (September 30, 2015: $Nil) in stock option
	compensation expense, in relation to these options for the nine month period
	ended September 30, 2016. Total stock option compensation expense is
	calculated at $884.  
	  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company granted
	a total of 900,000 options for the purchase of up to 900,000 shares of
	common stock to Tim Vance, the Company's CEO, in connection with the 2013 5
	year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, CFO, in connection with the
	execution of the 2013 5 year employment agreement. The Company uses the
	Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options granted. During
	the period ended March 31, 2015, the Company determined that the Employment
	Agreements between the Company and its Executive Officers be amended to
	adjust the exercise price form the lower of $0.03 to $0.0015 and that the
	expiration date of the options to be extended from January 31, 2018 to
	December 31, 2019. The change in value from the lower exercise price and
	extended expiration date was considered immaterial. The Black- Scholes model
	was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that
	have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The model requires
	management to make estimates, which are subjective and may not be
	representative of actual results. The Black-Scholes model calculations
	included stock price on date of measurement of $0.0036, exercise price of
	$0.001, a term of 1.5 years, computed volatility of 251% and a discount rate
	of 0.33%. Assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock based
	compensation is as follows: 

The Company recorded $266 (September 30, 2015: $2,007) in
	stock option compensation expense, in relation to these options for the nine
	month period ended September 30, 2016. Total stock option compensation
	expense is calculated at $3,039.  
	  During the first quarter of 2014, the
	Company granted a total of 900,000 options for the purchase of up to 900,000
	shares of common stock to Tim Vance, the Company's CEO, in connection with
	the 2013 5 year employment agreement and to Gary Woerz, CFO, in connection
	with the execution of the 2013 5 year employment agreement. The Company uses

	compensation is as follows:   

	  The Company recorded $Nil (September 30, 2015: $524) in
	stock option compensation expense, in relation to these options for the nine
	month period ended September 30, 2016. Total stock option compensation
	expense is calculated at $2,877.  
	  During the third
	quarter of 2013, the Company issued unregistered shares as follows: (i)
	33,334 restricted shares to Jim Tevis, the Company's CTO, in connection with
	the execution of a new 2 year consulting agreement. The restricted shares
	were valued at $0.555 per share using the closing price of the stock on the
	date of grant. Total expense associated with the issuances is calculated at
	$18,500 to be recognized over the 2 year term of the agreement. The expense
	recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $Nil. The expense
	recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $6,919.  
	 	 The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION    
 Back to Table of Contents   

Some of the statements contained in this quarterly report of
Data Call Technologies, Inc., Nevada corporation (hereinafter referred to as
 we ,  us ,  our ,  Company  and the  Registrant ) discuss future expectations,
contain projections of our plan of operation or financial condition or state
other forward-looking information. Forward-looking statements give our current
expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by
the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They
use of words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend, 
 plan,   believe,  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection
with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to
time, we also may provide forward-looking statements in other materials we
release to the public.  
	 Data Call Technologies, Inc. ( Data Call,  or the
	 Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as Data
	Call Wireless on April 4, 2002. On March 1, 2006, we changed our name to
	Data Call Technologies, Inc. 
	 Our mission is to integrate cutting-edge
	information/content delivery solutions currently deployed by the media and
	make this content rapidly available to and within the control of our retail
	and commercial clients. The Company's software and services put its clients
	in control of real-time, news, and other content, including emergency
	alerts, displayed within one building to thousands of local, regional, and
	national clients, through Digital Signage and Kiosk networks. 
	 Our business plan is to focus on growing our client base
	by continued offering of real-time information/content, seeking to
	continually improve the delivery, security, and variety of
	information/content to the Digital Signage and Kiosk community. 
	  Overview  
	  What Is Digital Signage?  
	 LED and LCD displays are continually replacing printed
	marketing materials such as signs and placards, as well as the old-fashioned
	whiteboard, for product and corporate branding, marketing and assisted
	selling. The appeal of instantly updating product videos and promotional
	messages on one or a thousand remotely located displays is driving the
	adoption of this exciting marketing tool. Digital Signage presentations are
	typically comprised of repeating loops of information used to brand, market
	or sell the owner's products and services. But once viewed, this information
	becomes repetitive and the viewer tunes it out, resulting in low retention
	of the client's message. As digital signage  comes of age,  the dynamic
	characteristics of the digital signage presentations has taken center-stage
	requiring fresh, relevant and updated dynamic content. 
	  Digital Signage Comes of Age   
	 We believe that the Digital Signage industry is  coming
	of age  and that Data Call through multiple industry relationships has been
	engaged in the business for more than a decade. Our company has virtually
	been there from the start and is in in a prime position to enjoy and benefit
	from our industry's growth. A few short years ago, a business wanting to
	derive commercial benefit from use of digital signage was often confronted
	with a myriad of hardware and software companies, all offering their own
	version of what digital signage should be. Typical customers for digital
	signage were most-often offered the hardware for digital signage but without
	the full package of content with which to build and tailor their systems for
	their target customer base.  
	 Those early digital signage customers often had to deal
	with the fact that their digital signage hardware vendors lacked the
	know-how to provide them with the  do's and don'ts  of content development.
	However, from our inception, Data Call recognized that our competitors and
	their typical customers lacked a key component which includes the offering
	of a comprehensive content package.  
	 Recently, as the cost of platforms supporting content
	management infrastructure and displays has fallen significantly, digital
	signage has become more accessible to a wider range of potential users while
	the growing Kiosk market has cross-pollinated with Digital Signage.
	Companies in our industry have come to understand as we have understood
	almost since our inception in 2002, that the benefit that Data Call provides
	to our customers, in the form of ongoing content development (dynamic
	content) is expected to continue to provide our customers with desirable
	services. Content needs to stay fresh. Data Call has automated this process
	for their subscribers. As the cost of deployment has decreased, Data Call
	has continued to focus, as well as other providers have only begun focusing,
	on offering  attention-grabbing content  as a means of drawing target
	customers' attention to the core message of clients, thereby keeping their
	target customers engaged throughout Digital Signage and Kiosk presentations. 
	  The Need for Speed-Active Content   
	 Active and dynamic content is the integral part of
	digital signage presentations that must be constantly updated with timely
	and relevant information in order to attract and retain target customers to
	the product and service offered by clients. For instance, a typical
	presentation may contain ten 15-second loops that provide the primary
	message of the presentation, but the active dynamic content, such as that
	provided by Data Call, is updated with new information throughout the day.
	Those seeking to add active and dynamic content to their digital signage
	presentations are advised to employ Data Call's integrated content rather
	than attempting to  cut and paste  broadcast content of others into their
	digital signage presentation. 
	 Our clients, by integrating Data Call's active content as
	a meaningful component of their digital signage presentations, can provide
	the entertainment and information content necessary to enhance the target
	customer's information retention without disrupting the core message of the
	presentation. Information categories provided by Data Call include news,
	weather, sports, financial data and the latest traffic alerts, among others.
	With such a broad range of offerings, our clients have access to the active
	and dynamic content they need, regardless of the target customers and market
	they are addressing. 
	  Our Business Opportunities   
	 Our many opportunities for client development in the
	digital signage industry are growing virtually exponentially. While many
	companies in our industry have traditionally outsourced all or part of their
	content creation, Data Call serves as a provider of dynamic active content
	to clients on a tailored basis. Whether a client desires general
	entertainment information for customers, such as news, sports, stock market
	quotes, etc. or location-specific content, such as local weather, traffic,
	product sales and specials, etc., our research has validated our long-held
	assumption that dynamic content draws and retains our clients' target
	viewers to their digital signage and keeps them engaged throughout the
	presentation. 
	 Since our inception, management has developed strong
	relationships working with the leaders in digital signage. Collaborative
	efforts successfully created the data formats and means of communication to
	facilitate the delivery of our dynamic content more easily and efficiently
	by our clients for integration into their hardware and software products,
	setting industry standards. 
	  Partners, Not Customers  
	 Data Call's approach to our clients is to build
	long-lasting partnerships by creating client relationships that we believe
	are unique in the digital signage industry. We do this because we understand
	that each client has its own content requirement. In developing dynamic
	content for individual digital signage clients, we have identified three
	content-related factors: (i) reliability; (ii) objectivity; and (iii) ease
	of implementation. To address the reliability requirement, we have elected
	to enter into license arrangements with the leading providers of news,
	weather, sports and financial information, among other client-desired
	content rather than either: (i) downloading and repackaging content sourced
	from the Internet (which may be illegal); or (ii) pulling RSS feeds (which
	may come and go at the provider's whim). Licensing data from these premier
	providers has also served us by satisfying the second criteria, objectivity.
	Because it is commonly recognized that Internet content may often be
	unreliable, unverifiable and biased, we have determined that we could not
	simply use unfiltered Internet content for delivery to our clients. To
	achieve ease of implementation, our licensing of data facilitates the ease
	of delivery to and implementation and use by our client/partners. Data Call
	has understood that it's Digital Signage and Kiosk clients needed more
	complete service than to endeavor the sourcing of active content from
	multiple vendors. As a result, our flexible content packages permit our
	clients to do  one stop shopping  for all of their dynamic content
	requirements by a single sublicense from us. Ease of implementation also
	would require that the multiple formats of all Data Call's data providers be
	distilled into a single, usable format.  
	 We enable our clients to receive customized dynamic
	content which may be displayed in a multitude of ways (banners, tickers,
	scrolls or artistically integrated with the overall presentations). We have
	created and produced multiple sets of common data layouts in the
	industry-standard XML (extensible markup language) format inclusive of MRSS.
	With the advent of HTML5, even more delivery methods have been made
	available to our clients, many of whom have found these new formats to be
	easily integrated into their products. Nevertheless, we have also produced
	customized data formats to the exact and specific requirements of our
	clients/partners, which, we believe ensures a higher level of reliability
	and ease of integration. 
	 Market demand, opportunity and technology converge at a
	single point in time, and Data Call is there. Our integrity continues to
	build our business. Digital signage platforms are evolving to meet mass
	market requirements, costs for hardware and software are falling to the
	point of becoming commodities and the markets for digital signage are
	clarifying through historical trial and error. 
	  Business Operations  
	 In August of 2013, we announced the release of our Direct
	Lynk Media (DLMedia) product. The DLMedia product encapsulates the Direct
	Lynk Messenger product with major enhancements and options that allow the
	client to select and include in their feed images relative to the news
	feeds. Also in the release, both Weather and Traffic image products have
	been enhanced considerably. Other additions included within the release
	bring more value to the company's clients and create more interest from new
	and existing clients.

We currently offer our Direct Lynk Messenger and DLMedia services to our
clients and other potential customers through the Internet. Both DLM Services
are Digital Signage products and real-time information services which provides a
wide range of up-to-date information for display. Both DLM services are able to
work concurrently with customers' existing digital signage systems. The Direct
Lynk Messenger product is slowly becoming a legacy product with the DLMedia
product in the forefront.  
	 The Digital Signage and Kiosk industry is still a relatively new and
	since our inception in 2002 we have come to understand that it provides an
	exciting method for advertisers, including our clients, to promote, inform,
	educate, and entertain their customers regarding their business products and
	services. Through Digital Signage, businesses can use a single display or a
	complex, networked series of flat screen LED, LCD and even combined as video
	walls as display devices to market their products and services directly at
	their facilities and elsewhere to their customers and patrons in real time.
	Additionally, because Digital Signage advertising takes place in real time,
	businesses can change their marketing efforts literally from moment to
	moment and over the course of a day or such other period as they may
	determine.  
	 We believe that the ability of our clients to display in real-time the
	information and content we deliver better allows our clients companies to
	tailor their products, services and advertising to individual and
	target-group customers, thereby advertising and offering, for example,
	inventory and sales discounts that may be designed to appeal to those
	individual customers and target customer groups, increasing sales and
	revenues. We believe that the benefits of on-site, real-time Digital Signage
	displays compared to regular print or video advertising are substantial and
	include, among other advantages, being able to immediately change
	digitally-displayed images/advertisements depending on our client's
	customers own situation, not simply being restricted by in-store print
	circulars produced days, weeks or even months in advance, which may become
	stale or obsolete prior to or shortly after publication and dissemination.  
	 We specialize in allowing clients to create their own Digital Signage
	dynamic content feeds which are delivered online directly to their chosen,
	electronic digital display devices at their various facilities. The only
	requirements our clients must have are: (i) a supported, third-party Digital
	Signage and/or Kiosk equipment solution, or similar device, which receives
	the data from our servers online; and (ii) an Internet connection. Our
	Direct Lynk System is supported by various, readily available third-party
	systems, varying in costs from inexpensive monthly cloud-based licenses to
	much more extensive and expensive content management/playback systems. Our
	Direct Lynk Systems allow customers to select from the pre-determined data
	and information subscriptions of those described above. We enable our
	clients to also select location specific content they wish to receive based
	on how and where their Digital Signage network is configured. 
	 During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we released our  Playlist-Ready 
	content products, enhancing our ability to further accommodate our current
	clients and appease new prospects. One product within the  Above the Fold 
	line has received a high level of acceptance at the industry trade shows,
	most recently at the Digital Signage Expo held in Las Vegas in March 2016.
	All of our products and services can be viewed on our website:
	datacalltech.com. 
	  Results of Operations  
	 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial
	statements. 
	 During the last twelve months, the Company has implemented cost
	management measurements to review monthly expenditures. We will continue
	these efforts to streamline operations, as we focus on increasing sales and
	gross revenues over the next twelve months. We do not currently have any
	plans to increase our monthly expenditures or number of employees. We
	currently offer our Direct Lynk Messenger and DLMedia services to our
	clients and other potential customers through the Internet. Both DLM
	Services are Digital Signage products and real-time information services
	which provides a wide range of up-to-date information for display. Both DLM
	services are able to work concurrently with customers' existing digital
	signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product is slowly becoming a
	legacy product with the DLMedia product in the forefront. 
	 We continually add subscribers for our technology throughout and intend
	to build and increase such subscribers moving forward. 
	  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended
	September 30, 2015  
	 Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $167,602,
	compared to $153,697 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015,
	representing an increase of $13,905 or approximately 9.0%. The increase in
	revenues was mainly due to additional sales and marketing efforts.  
	 Costs of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $41,076
	compared to $39,244 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015,
	cost of sales for the quarter increased $1,832. These costs are related to
	the licensing and royalty expense required providing enhanced subscription
	services.  
	 Gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $126,526
	compared to $114,453 as of September 30, 2015, or 75.5% for the three-month
	period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 74.5% for the three month
	period ending September 30, 2015. 
	 Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016 were $163,104 compared to $160,711 for the three-month
	period ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $2,393 from the
	same period in the prior year. The increase in SG A expenses is mainly due
	to an increase in personnel. Net loss for the three months ended September
	30, 2016 was $37,988 compared to a net loss of $47,834 for the three-month
	period ended September 30, 2015. The Company's net loss was significantly
	lower for the third quarter of 2016 due to increased operational
	efficiencies and the increase in new sales. The Company has calculated that
	net income from operations for the third quarter of 2016 would have been
	$7,039 if the non-cash items (expense for stock for services and options
	which totaled $45,027) were added back to the current net loss. 
	  Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine months Ended
	September 30, 2015  
	 Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $494,798,
	compared to $458,245 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015,
	representing an increase of $36,553 or approximately 8.0%. The increase in
	revenues was mainly due to additional sales and marketing efforts.  
	 Costs of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were
	$118,528, compared to $109,382 for the same period of the prior year. This
	increase was due the costs related to the licensing and royalty expense
	required to provide the subscription services and the additional cost
	associated with the increase in revenue. 
	 Gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $ 376,270
	compared to $348,863 as of September 30, 2015, or 76.1% for the nine month
	period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 76.1% for the nine month
	period ending September 30, 2015. 
	 Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 were $517,285 compared to $518,666 for the nine month
	period ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $1,381 from the
	same period in the prior year. The decrease in SG A expenses is mainly due
	to managements ongoing efforts to increase operational efficiencies. Net
	loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $144,340 compared to a
	net loss of $175,151 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The
	Company's net loss was significantly lower for the third quarter of 2016 due
	to increased operational efficiencies and the increase in new sales. The
	Company has calculated that net loss from operations for the nine month
	period ended September 30, 2016 would have been $5,152 if the non-cash items
	(expense for stock for services and options which totaled $149,492 were
	added back to the current net loss. 
	  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
	 As of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $159,330,
	consisting of $ 72,049 in cash, $79,281 in accounts receivable and $8,000 in
	prepaid expenses and had total current liabilities of $90,993 consisting or
	$29,415 in accounts payable, $23,791 in accrued expenses and $37,787 in
	notes payable. 
	 At September 30, 2016, we had a positive working capital of $68,337 and
	an accumulated deficit since inception of $9,701,535. The Company had net
	cash used by operating activities of $8,484 during the nine-month period
	ended September 30, 2016, which was mainly due to a net loss of $144,340,
	stock for services and options expense of $149,492, an increase in accounts
	receivable of $22,435, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $6,965,
	an increase in accrued expenses of $2,008, a decrease in prepaid expenses of
	$3,370, depreciation expense of $513 and a decrease in deferred revenue of
	$4,057.  
	 We had no investing activities during the nine-month period ended
	September 30, 2016. We used $5,277 in our financing activities during the
	nine months ended September 30, 2016 for the repayment of a shareholder
	notes payable.
