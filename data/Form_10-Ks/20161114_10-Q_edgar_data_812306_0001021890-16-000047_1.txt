Notes to Financial Statements  

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed
or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited
consolidated financial statements dated June 30, 2016. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results
that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.  

Management
of the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, which require the use of management estimates, contain all adjustments (including normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the period presented and to make the financial
statements not misleading.  

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION  

Stock
based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Topic 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation in the Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to Topic 718, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to
be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values. Topic 718 rescinds the acceptance of pro forma disclosure.
In December 2009, our shareholders approved the adoption of a new stock option plan, providing the Company a continued means of
offering stock-based compensation.  

On
September 30, 2016, there were 40,000 outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock.  

The
fair value of a stock option is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which values options based on the stock
price at the grant date, the expected life of the option, the estimated volatility of the stock, the expected dividend payments,
and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option. There were no options granted during the quarter ended September
30, 2016.  

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. Because option valuation models require the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions
can materially affect the fair value of the options. Our options do not have the characteristics of traded options, therefore,
the option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our options.  

6 

EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic
earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive securities such as
stock options and other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock or resulted in the issuance
of Common Stock that then shared in earnings. We use the treasury stock method to compute potential common shares from stock options
and the as-if-converted method to compute potential common shares from Preferred Stock.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the potential dilutive effects of the preferred stock and stock options were included
in the weighted-average shares outstanding.  

NOTE
B - INVENTORIES   

NOTE
C - STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

During
January 1995, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred Stock ). The preferred stockholders are entitled to receive, as and if declared
by the board of directors, quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $.10 per share of Series A Preferred Stock per annum. Dividends
will accrue without interest and will be cumulative from the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and will be payable
quarterly in arrears in cash or publicly traded common stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors. As of September 30,
2016, no dividends have been declared. Dividends in arrears on the outstanding preferred shares total $375,594 as of September
30, 2016.  

Holders
of the Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into an equal number of shares of Common Stock
of the Company. In addition, Preferred Stock holders have the right to vote the number of shares into which their shares are convertible
into Common Stock. Such preferred shares will automatically convert into one share of Common Stock at the close of a public offering
of Common Stock by the Company provided the Company receives gross proceeds of at least $1,000,000, and the initial offering price
of the Common Stock sold in such offering is equal to or in excess of $1 per share. The Company is obligated to reserve an adequate
number of shares of its common stock to satisfy the conversion of all the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. There were no
shares converted during the reporting period. So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company is
prohibited from declaring dividends or other distributions related to its Common Stock or purchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring
any of the Common Stock.  

7 

NOTE D  - INCOME TAXES AND AVAILABLE CARRYFORWARD  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had consolidated income tax net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforward for federal income
tax purposes of approximately $1,739,000. The NOL will expire in various years ending through the year 2035. The utilization of
certain of the loss carryforwards are limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  

The
components of the provision for income tax benefits (expense) attributable to continued operations are as follows:  

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company s deferred
tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  

8 

Management
believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of the NOL carryforward, because of its previous trend of
earnings. Therefore, a valuation allowance is not considered necessary at this time.  

Income
taxes for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 differ from the amounts computed by applying the effective income tax
rates of 37.63%, to income taxes as a result of the following:   

The
earliest tax year still subject to examination by a major taxing jurisdiction is fiscal year end June 30, 2013.  

9 

The
Company made a review of its uncertain tax positions in accordance with applicable standards of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ). In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents the Company's expected treatment of a tax position
taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax
expense for financial reporting purposes. As a result of this review, the Company concluded that at this time there are no uncertain
tax positions, and there has been no cumulative effect on retained earnings.  

NOTE
E - LINE OF CREDIT   

The
Company has a $250,000, due-on-demand line of credit with a financial institution, collateralized by the Company s inventory
of $695,778 and net accounts receivable assets of $239,164. The line of credit is renewable annually in April. Our Chief Executive
Officer personally guaranteed the line of credit to the Company. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company owed $95,000
and $125,000 respectively, on the line of credit. The line of credit extends terms of cash advances at a variable rate set equal
to the prime rate at the time of advance. The interest rate can fluctuate according to the changes in its published prime rate.  

NOTE
F - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Regina W. Anderson, guarantees a $250,000 line of credit for the Company.  

NOTE
G - CONTINGENCIES   

The
Company was able to close three open recalls with the FDA and is currently involved with one open voluntary product recall initiated
May 20, 2016. Total recall costs incurred with the sole remaining open recall through September 30, 2016 were $3,197, of which
$3,197 occurred in the quarter ending September 30, 2016. Future recall costs are not expected.  

NOTE
H - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

We
have evaluated subsequent events through November 11, 2016, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

ITEM 2.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

General 

You should read the following discussion and
analysis in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

This
Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains
forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate, 
 continue,   estimate,   project,   intend,   hope,   believe 
and similar expressions, variations of these words or the negative of those words, and, any statement regarding possible or assumed
future results of operations of the Company's business, the markets for its products, anticipated expenditures, regulatory developments
or competition, or other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, are intended to identify forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
regarding events, conditions and financial trends including, without limitation, business conditions in the skin and wound care
market and the general economy, competitive factors, changes in product mix, production delays, product recalls, manufacturing
capabilities, and other risks or uncertainties detailed in other of the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
Such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's
actual plan of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position could differ materially from those expressed
in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. 

Recent Developments 

The Company was able
to close three of the open recalls with the FDA during the quarter, leaving one open voluntary product recall initiated May
20, 2016. The Company is unable to determine at this time whether or not there will be a long term adverse material effect to
our financial operations from the voluntary recall. The cost incurred by the Company related to the one open recall as of
September 30, 2016 was $3,197. Amerx is actively addressing all concerns surrounding the recall and is working directly with
the FDA to ensure full compliance moving forward. 

Amerx further expanded its product line into the advanced wound care market in January 2016, with the launch
of Amerx brand Calcium Alginate, Foam, Hydrocolloid and Bordered Gauze dressings. Amerx believes these new products complement
the Amerigel brand and continue to better position the Company for expanded growth opportunities. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The
Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. A summary of those significant accounting policies can
be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's annual report on form 10-K, for the year
ended June 30, 2016, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016. The estimates used by
management are based upon the Company's historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts
and circumstances. Certain of the Company's accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal
of the Company's financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part
of management. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   

11 

Accounts Receivable Allowance 

Accounts
receivable allowance reflects a reserve that reduces our customer accounts and receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible.
The valuation of accounts receivable is based upon the credit-worthiness of customers and third-party payers as well as historical
collection experience. Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense for estimated
amounts expected to be uncollectible from third-party payers and customers. The Company bases its estimates on its historical
collection experience, current trends, credit policy and on the analysis of accounts by aging category. At September 30, 2016,
and June 30, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,633 and $2,665, respectively.  

Advertising
and Marketing  

The
Company uses several forms of advertising, including sponsorships to agencies who represent the professionals in their respective
fields. The Company expenses these sponsorships over the term of the advertising arrangements on a straight line basis. Other
forms of advertising used by the Company include professional journal advertisements, distributor catalogs, website and mailing
campaigns. These forms of advertising are expensed when incurred.  

Deferred
Income Taxes  

Deferred
income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts, based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods
in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company accounts for income taxes under Topic 740 - Income
Tax in the Accounting Standards Codification. A valuation allowance is used to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected
to be recovered in future periods. The estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us
to exercise complex judgments. We periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available.
We did not have a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2016. Because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly
dependent upon future operating results, actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition  

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue
Recognition, corrected copy,  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer
is fixed or determinable; and, (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  

Stock
Based Compensation  

Stock
based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation in the Accounting Standards
Codification. All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the statement
of operations based upon their fair values. Topic 718 rescinds the acceptance of pro forma disclosure.  

12  

FINANCIAL
CONDITION  

As
of September 30, 2016 the Company's principal sources of liquid assets included cash of $53,213, inventories of $695,778, and
net accounts receivable of $239,164. The Company also has $293,325 in Certificate of Deposits. The Company had net working capital
of $1,131,782, and no long-term debt at September 30, 2016.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 cash decreased from $59,173 as of June 30, 2016, to $53,213. Operating activities provided
cash of $26,971 during the period. The change is primarily the result of the repayments on the line of credit.  

The
Company reflected a current deferred tax asset of $165,456, and non-current deferred tax asset of $495,846, at September 30, 2016.
Because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results, actual recoverability of
deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Gross
Sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, were $879,733 as compared to the previous year s gross sales of $855,042,
an increase of $24,691, or approximately 3%. Sales have been on the rise, we believe predominately from the success of our new
product lines launched in January 2015 and January 2016, respectively.  

Gross
profit during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $622,941 as compared to $624,107 during the quarter ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $1,166 or less then 1%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was approximately 71% in the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, and approximately 73% in the corresponding quarter in 2015. We expect that gross profit will continue to decrease
slightly as sales from the Collagen product increase.  

Operating
expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $574,054, consisting of $338,264 in salaries and benefits and $235,790
in selling, general and administrative expenses. This compares to operating expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2015
of $556,008, consisting of $308,759 in salaries and benefits; and $247,249 in selling, general and administrative expenses.  
 Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, increased by $18,046 or approximately 3% compared
to the corresponding quarter in 2015. Salaries and benefits expenses increased for the quarter primarily due to addition of a
Quality Assurance Manager and commissions paid on increased sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 5%
between corresponding periods as decreases in marketing efforts reductions in professional fees.  

Operating
profit decreased by $19,212 to an operating profit of $48,887 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an
operating profit of $68,099 in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Income before income taxes was $47,927 during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net profit of $64,284 during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease in net income before income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in Salaries and Benefits from increased
commissions and the addition of a Quality Assurance Manager.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

Management
of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, management, including the Chief Executive
and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that all material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed
in this report has been made known to management in a timely manner and ensuring that this information is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, because of the identification
of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, identified below, which we view as an integral part
of our disclosure controls and procedures.  

(b)   Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  

As
previously reported, our annual assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 revealed a deficiency
that we consider to be a material weakness: inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.  

During
fiscal 2017, the Company will continue to address changes needed to improve segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.
We have added staff to grow sales. We expect that increased sales will enable us to add support staff, specifically in the accounting
and shipping departments. A secondary effect of adding more staff will address needed improvements in segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives.

      disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                           our supervision, to ensure that material information

      those entities, particularly
      during the period in which this report is being

likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and  

5.

                                        officer(s) and I have disclosed, based

      process, summarize and report financial information;
