Our business model was to buy nutrition
and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our privatelabel. Our source of revenue from
operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary products that we intended
to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently, we have not
yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date. 

At present, we have no employees other

2.   
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

(a)   
       Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance with U.S. GAAP and Rule 10-01 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP. The condensed statements of operations for the six months ended October
31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim period. These unaudited
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary
for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented have been reflected in such condensed financial statements. 

The Company maintains its general ledger
and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements and notes are representations
of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to U.S. GAAP and have been consistently applied in the presentation
of financial statements. The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

(b)   
       Net loss per common share    

The Company complies with accounting
and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.  Net loss per common share is computed by dividing
net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. At October
31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or
converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same
as basic loss per common share for the period. 

(c)   
       Use of estimates    

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at
the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

(d)   
       Recently issued or adopted standards    

The Company does not expect the adoption
of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations, financial
position or cash flow.

  (UNAUDITED)  

3.   
       INCOME TAXES    

As of October 31, 2016, the Company
had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $88,194 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable
income in varying amounts through 2033. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been
recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company
has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 

Due to the change in ownership
provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $88,194 for Federal income tax
reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards
may be limited as to use in future years. 

4.   
       GOING CONCERN AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

The Company does not currently engage
in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

filing of Exchange Act reports,   

transfer agent services,   

payment of annual corporate fees, and   

investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.   

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $88,194, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that fees associated with filing of Exchange Act reports including
accounting fees and legal fees and payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000 within the next 12 months. We do not
currently intend to retain any entity to act as a  finder  to identify and analyze the merits of potential target
businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to,
our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct
a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be
made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds, would
be desirable. If the management can find a suitable target company, we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the
investigation into the target company (including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the reverse
merger, which may cost between $125,000 to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond such time will
be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since we have
minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the Exchange
Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.  

5.   
       LOANS FROM OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS    

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had
received loans from its officers and directors aggregating $65,388. The loans are non-interest bearing and contain no specific
repayment terms. 

Item 2.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes
forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future
events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may
cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   could,   would, 
 expect,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   continue, 
or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include,
but are not limited to, those described under  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016,
as filed on July 29 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and related Notes
thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

Overview  

Lvyuan Green Building Material Technology
Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2013 as Green Supplements Online Inc.
We changed to our present name on September 24, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at Room 01, 25/F, Kerry Center,
No. 2008 Renmin South Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong, People s Republic of China. Our phone number is +86-755-2218-4466. 

Our business model was to buy nutrition
and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our private label. Our source of revenue from
operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary products that we intended
to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently, we have not yet
initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date. 

The Company is seeking to acquire, through
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar
business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified. 

Operating Expenses  

During the quarters ended October 31,
2016 and 2015, we have incurred $7,656 and $14,239 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid to the Company s independent
accounting firm associated with the SEC filings. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we have incurred $24,740 and
$18,300 in expenses, respectively.  

Going Concern  

The Company does not currently engage
in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

filing of Exchange Act reports,     

payment of annual corporate fees, and     

investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.   

As of October 31, 2016, the Company has
an accumulated deficit of $88,194. Management anticipates that fees associated with the filing of Exchange Act reports including
accounting fees, legal fees and the payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000 during the next 12 months. We do not
currently intend to retain any entity to act as a  finder  to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses.
Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates,
lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct a complete and
exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed
feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds, would be desirable. If management
can find a suitable target company, we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the investigation into the target company
(including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000
to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested
in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to
the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely
consummate a business combination. 

Currently, our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing
to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger
with such company. Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction
and/or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available. 

The Company may consider a business which
has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets,
is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or
merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market
for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may
occur in a public offering. 

Any target business that is selected
may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established
records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially
unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may affect a business combination with an entity
in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our management anticipates that it will
likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for
present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling
interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. 

The Company anticipates that the
selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Our potential merger targets are firms seeking
either the benefits of a business combination with an SEC reporting company and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things,
facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the
principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key
employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of
stock. While a private operating company may achieve the same benefits by filing its own Exchange Act registration statement,
such benefits can be achieved at a potentially faster rate with limited regulatory review through the completion of a
business combination with a public reporting company. A potentially available business combination may occur in many
different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. The time required to select and evaluate a target
business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of
certainty. 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting
a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There
are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the United States that have significant financial resources, that are
seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater
technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those
of many of these competitors. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of October 31, 2016, our total assets
were $1,494 and our total liabilities were $65,488, comprised of notes payable to related parties. 

As of April 30, 2016, our total assets
were $0 and our total liabilities were $39,254, comprised of notes payable to related parties. 

Stockholders  equity decreased
from $(39,254) as of April 30, 2016 to $(63,944) as of October 31, 2016.  

Stockholders  equity decreased
from $(2,925) as of April 30, 2015 to $(21,225) as of October 31, 2015.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

We have not generated positive cash flows
from operating activities. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were
$(26,134) and (18,300) respectively. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

We have financed our operations primarily
from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, net
cash from financing activities was $26,134 and $17,831, respectively, consisting of loans from directors.  

We suffered recurring losses from operations
and have an accumulated deficit of $88,194 as of October 31, 2016 and 2015. Currently, we are a non-operating public company. We
currently are seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization,
exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have
not yet identified. In the event we use all of our cash resources, certain members of management and shareholders have indicated
their willingness to loan us funds at the prevailing market rate, assuming we find a suitable candidate for an acquisition, until
such acquisition is consummated. Even though this is their current intention, they have made no firm commitment and it is at their
sole discretion whether or not to fund us. In the event they do not fund us and we are not able to find outside investors, we will
not have the funds necessary to operate and will have to dissolve. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any off-balance

Item 3.   
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.    

Not applicable. 

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Based on an evaluation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of October 31, 2016, the
Company s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial
and accounting officer) has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable
assurance level. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls   

A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There have not been any changes in the
Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended October
31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
