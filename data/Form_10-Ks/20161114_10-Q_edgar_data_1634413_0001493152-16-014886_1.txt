NOTE
1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

NATURE
OF OPERATIONS   

EverythingAmped
Corporation (formerly Brown Grotto Acquisition Corporation) or  the Company  was incorporated on January 12, 2015
under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected
mergers and acquisitions.  

On
September 15, 2015, the Company effected a change in control by the redemption of 19,500,000 shares of the then outstanding 20,000,000
shares of common stock. The then current officers and directors resigned and David Boulette was named the sole officer and director
of the Company. Pursuant to the change in control the Company changed its name to EverythingAmped Corporation. On September 16,
2015, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Boulette.  

The
Company intends to develop, either through a business combination with an ongoing company or an online company offering, owned
and operated web sites and hundreds of mobile apps integrated exclusively to build a custom Demand Side Platform. This platform
will provide unparalleled online advertising opportunities to companies of all sizes.  

The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with EverythingAmped.
The combination is expected to take the form of a merger, a stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  

In
most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization
under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company
will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign
or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, unaudited condensed statements of operations for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion
of management of the Company, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period. These unaudited condensed financial
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the year ended December 31, 2015,
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying audited condensed balance sheet as of December 31,
2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements filed in our Form 10-K and is included for comparison purposes in
the accompanying balance sheet.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

EVERYTHINGAMPED CORPORATION (Formerly Brown
Grotto Acquisition Corporation)  

  Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.  

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.  

INCOME
TAXES   

Under
ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were
no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.  

LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE   

Basic
loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement
related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.
The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly.  

Level
3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

  Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained an operating loss of $35,109 for the period
ended September 30, 2016. The Company had no working capital and an accumulated deficit of $39,134 as of September 30, 2016. The
Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

In
order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from
operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its
current level of operations.  

NOTE
3 - STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30,
2016, 3,500,000 shares of common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding.  

On
January 22, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock to two directors and officers. On September 15, 2015, the
Company redeemed and cancelled 19,500,000 of the then outstanding 20,000,000 shares.  

On
September 16, 2015, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares to David Boulette as part of the change in control of the Company.  

During
the period ending September 30, 2016, Mr. Boulette, as the Company s sole officer and director, paid for Company operating
expenses as a capital contribution in the amount of $35,772 which has been recorded as additional paid-in capital .   

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .   

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking
statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the
words  believes,   project,   expects,   anticipates,   estimates, 
 intends,   strategy,   plan,   may,   will,   would, 
 will be,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions. We intend such
forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor provisions.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which
may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations
and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory
changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties
should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. Further information concerning our business, including additional factors that could materially affect
our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  

The
Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any business activities generating revenues. The Company s principal
business objective is to effect the business combination with a target company so as to develop its business plan of an integrated
mobile apps web site.  

The
Company intends to develop through a business combination with an ongoing company or otherwise an online company offering owned
and operated web sites and hundreds of mobile apps integrated exclusively to build a custom Demand Side Platform allowing unparalleled
online advertising opportunities to companies of all sizes.  

A
combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances
the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  

In
implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization,
joint venture, licensing agreement or other arrangement with another corporation or entity. On the consummation of a transaction,
it is likely that the present management and shareholders of the Company will no longer be in control of the Company. In addition,
it is likely that the officer and director of the Company will, as part of the terms of the business combination, resign and be
replaced by one or more new officers and directors.  

No
assurances can be given that EverythingAmped will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.  

The
most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived benefits of a reporting corporation. Such perceived benefits may
include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive
stock options or similar benefits to key employees, increasing the opportunity to use securities for acquisitions, providing liquidity
for shareholders and other factors. Business opportunities may be available at various stages of development, all of which will
make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.  

In
analyzing prospective business opportunities, EverythingAmped may consider such matters as the available technical, financial
and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future;
nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth
of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable
but which may be anticipated; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition
or acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. This discussion of the proposed
criteria is not meant to be restrictive of the virtually unlimited discretion of the Company to search for and enter into potential
business opportunities.  

The
search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific kind of business entities, but may acquire a venture which
is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its business life. It
is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged, whether such business
may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which
the Company may offer.  

It
is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration
under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction,
the Company may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified
times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into
an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their
potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the Company s securities may depress the market value of the
Company s securities in the future if such a market develops, of which there is no assurance.  

While
the terms of a business transaction to which the Company may be a party cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to
the business transaction will desire to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a tax-free
reorganization under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  

The
Company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although
the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties
of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must
be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had a net loss of $23,719 with no revenue versus a net loss of $750 with
no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Revenue   

The
Company has not generated revenues since its inception.  

Operating
Expenses   

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $23,719 versus $750 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in expenses is due to the costs associated with preparing the Company s quarterly financial statements
and the legal expenses associated with the reporting requirements of public companies.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had a net loss of $35,109 with no revenue versus a net loss of $1,462 with
no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Revenue   

The
Company has not generated revenues since its inception.  

Operating
Expenses   

Total
operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $35,109 versus $1,462 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in expenses is due to the costs associated with preparing the Company s quarterly financial statements
and the legal expenses associated with the reporting requirements of public companies.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,900 versus a working capital
of approximately $2,563 as of December 31, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities.  

During
the period ending September 30, 2016, Mr. Boulette, as the Company s sole officer and director, has financed operations
in the amount of $35,772.  

The
Company s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to
successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with EverythingAmped.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016 there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Plan
of Operations for the Next Twelve Months   

Our
plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:  

During
2016, the Company intends to develop an online company, offering owned and operated web sites and hundreds of mobile apps integrated
exclusively to build a custom Demand Side Platform allowing unparalleled online advertising opportunities to companies of all
sizes. The most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived benefits of a reporting corporation. Such perceived benefits
may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive
stock options or similar benefits to key employees, increasing the opportunity to use securities for acquisitions, providing liquidity
for shareholders and other factors. Business opportunities may be available at various stages of development, all of which will
make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.  

In
analyzing prospective business opportunities, EverythingAmped may consider such matters as the available technical, financial
and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future;
nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth
of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable
but which may be anticipated; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition
or acceptance of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. This discussion of the proposed
criteria is not meant to be restrictive of the virtually unlimited discretion of the Company to search for and enter into potential
business opportunities.  

The
search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific kind of business entities, but may acquire a venture that is
in its preliminary or development stage, that is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its business life. It is
impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged, whether such business may
need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which the
Company may offer. The Company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate
agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations
and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions
which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms.  

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates   

Our
significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting
policies require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results.
These policies are described in  Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates  and Note 2 (Accounting Policies)
to Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the first nine months ending
September 30, 2016, there have been no modifications to our Accounting Policies as defined in Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on our financial statements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures . Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d   15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal
financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . We have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other key members of our management. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had limited accounting staff limited to our Chief Financial Officer and external consultants. Limited
resources in this area do not provide sufficient staffing for internal control purposes. We monitor this situation closely and
have ongoing plans to add support as needed in this area when resources permit.  

Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting.  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting during the first two
quarters of 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving
patents that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

None.  

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   

None.  

Item
4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   

Not
applicable.  

Item
5. Other Information.   

None.
