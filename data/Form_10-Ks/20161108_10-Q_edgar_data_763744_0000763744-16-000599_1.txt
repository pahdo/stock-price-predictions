1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Drew Industries Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( Drew  and collectively with its subsidiaries, the  Company ). Drew has no unconsolidated subsidiaries. Drew,   through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Lippert Components  or  LCI ), supplies a broad array of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) of recreational vehicles ( RVs ) and adjacent industries including   buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; manufactured homes; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units  . The Company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company operated   45   manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the United States and in Canada and Italy. 
    
  Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Additionally, sales of components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counter-seasonal. 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the accounting policies described in its   December 31, 2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in that report. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets, net assets of acquired businesses, income taxes, warranty and product recall obligations, self-insurance obligations, lease terminations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, contingent consideration, environmental liabilities, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, other available information and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other resources. Actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the information furnished in this Form 10-Q reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, and therefore do not include some information necessary to conform to annual reporting requirements.

7.    LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings on its line of credit. At   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   $41.8 million   of outstanding borrowings on its line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of   2.0 percent  . 
    
  On February 24, 2014, the Company entered into a   $75.0 million   line of credit (the  Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. On March 3, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its line of credit by   $25.0 million   to   $100.0 million  . Interest on borrowings under the line of credit was designated from time to time by the Company as either (i) the Prime Rate, minus a rate ranging from   0.75   to   1.0 percent   (minus   1.0 percent   at   September 30, 2015  ), but not less than   1.5 percent  , or (ii) LIBOR, plus additional interest ranging from   1.75   to   2.0 percent   (plus   1.75 percent   at   September 30, 2015  ) depending on the Company s performance and financial condition. 
    
  On April 27, 2016, the Company announced the refinancing of its line of credit through an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., and 1st Source Bank. The agreement amends and restates the existing line of credit, which was scheduled to expire on January 1, 2019, and now expires on April 27, 2021 (the  Amended Credit Agreement ). In connection with this amendment and restatement, the line of credit was increased from     $100.0 million   to   $200.0 million  ,   and contains a feature allowing the Company to draw up to     $50.0 million     in approved foreign currencies, including Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, pound sterling and euros. The maximum borrowings under the line of credit can be further increased by     $125.0 million  ,   subject to certain conditions.   Interest on borrowings under the new line of credit is designated from time to time by the Company as either (i) the Alternate Base Rate (defined in the Amended Credit Agreement as the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate of JPMorgan Chase, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.5 percent   and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period plus   1.0 percent  ), plus additional interest ranging from   0.0 percent   to   0.625 percent   (  0.0 percent   at   September 30, 2016  ) depending on the Company s performance and financial condition, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a period equal to one, two, three, six or twelve months as selected by the Company, plus additional interest ranging from   1.0 percent   to   1.625 percent   (  1.0 percent   at   September 30, 2016  ) depending on the Company s performance and financial condition. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.5 million   in outstanding, but undrawn, standby letters of credit under the line of credit. Availability under the Company s line of credit was   $197.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On February 24, 2014, the Company also entered into a   $150.0 million    shelf-loan  facility with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and its affiliates ( Prudential )  .   The facility provides for Prudential to consider purchasing, at the Company s request, in one or a series of transactions, Senior Promissory Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of up to     $150.0 million  , to mature no more than   12 years   after the date of original issue of each Senior Promissory Note. Prudential has no obligation to purchase the Senior Promissory Notes.   Interest payable on the Senior Promissory Notes will be at rates determined by Prudential within   five   business days after the Company issues a request to Prudential.   On March 20, 2015, the Company issued     $50.0 million   of Senior Promissory Notes to Prudential for a term of   five   years, at a fixed interest rate of   3.35 percent   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, of which the entire amount was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Availability under the Company s  shelf-loan  facility, subject to the approval of Prudential, was   $100.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt approximates the carrying value, as estimated using quoted market prices and discounted future cash flows based on similar borrowing arrangements. 
    
  On April 27, 2016, the Company also amended and restated its  shelf-loan  facility with Prudential   to conform certain covenants and other terms to the Amended Credit Agreement.   The undrawn  shelf-loan  facility expires February 24, 2017. The Company is considering renewal options. 
    
  Borrowings under both the line of credit and the  shelf-loan  facility are secured on a pari-passu basis by first priority liens on the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries (including up to   65 percent   of the equity interest of certain  controlled foreign corporations. ) 
    
  Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement and  shelf-loan  facility, the Company is required to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages, and to meet certain other financial requirements. At     September 30, 2016  ,   the Company was in compliance with all such requirements, and expects to remain in compliance for the next twelve months. 
    
  Availability under both the Amended Credit Agreement and the  shelf-loan  facility is subject to a maximum leverage ratio covenant which limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness to     2.5     times the trailing twelve-month EBITDA, as defined. This limitation did not impact the Company s borrowing availability at     September 30, 2016  . The remaining availability  
  
   14 

    DREW INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

under these facilities was   $297.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  .   The Company believes the availability under the Amended Credit Agreement and  shelf-loan  facility is adequate to finance the Company s anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. 

8.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Contingent Consideration 
    
  In connection with certain business acquisitions, if agreed upon sales targets for the acquired products are achieved, the Company would pay additional cash consideration. The Company has recorded a liability for the fair value of this contingent consideration at   September 30, 2016  , based on the present value of the expected future cash flows using a market participant s weighted average cost of capital of   12.4 percent  . 
    
  As required, the liability for this contingent consideration is measured at fair value quarterly, considering actual sales of the acquired products, updated sales projections, and the updated market participant weighted average cost of capital. Depending upon the weighted average costs of capital and future sales of the products which are subject to contingent consideration, the Company could record adjustments in future periods which may increase or decrease the liability. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company s contingent consideration liability for the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

(a)   
    Recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
               (b)   
    Amounts represent the fair value of estimated remaining payments. The total estimated remaining payments as of   September 30, 2016   are   $14.0 million  . The liability for contingent consideration expires at various dates through September 2029. Certain of the contingent consideration arrangements are subject to a maximum payment amount, while the remaining arrangements have no maximum contingent consideration. 
       
  Furrion Distribution and Supply Agreement 
    
  In July 2015, the Company entered into a   six  -year exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Furrion Limited ( Furrion ), a Hong Kong based firm that designs, engineers and supplies premium electronics. This agreement provides the Company with the rights to distribute Furrion s complete line of products to OEMs and aftermarket customers in the RV, specialty vehicle, utility trailer, horse trailer, marine, transit bus and school bus industries throughout the United States and Canada. Furrion currently supplies a premium line of LED televisions, sound systems, navigation systems, wireless backup cameras, solar prep units, power solutions and kitchen appliances, primarily to the RV industry. 
    
  In connection with this agreement, the Company entered into the following minimum purchase obligations ( MPOs ), which the Company anticipates will be revised from time to time:

    DREW INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

After the first year, Furrion and the Company have agreed to review these MPOs on an annual basis and adjust the MPOs as necessary based upon current economic and industry conditions, the development and customer acceptance of new Furrion products, competition and other factors which impact demand for Furrion products. There has been good market acceptance of Furrion products during the first year of the distribution agreement; however, the MPO was not achieved for the year ended June   30, 2016  , primarily due to the timing of development and availability of anticipated new products from Furrion. As a result, the parties are currently in discussions to revise the MPOs, and the Company and Furrion are working together to increase product availability and new product introductions. 
    
  Subject to agreed upon revisions to the MPOs, Furrion has the right to either terminate the distribution agreement with six months  notice or remove exclusivity from the Company if the Company misses an MPO in any given year by more than ten percent, after taking into account excess purchases from the previous year. If exclusivity is withdrawn, the Company at its election may terminate the distribution agreement with six months  notice. Upon termination of the agreement, Furrion has agreed to purchase from the Company any non-obsolete stocks of Furrion products at the cost paid by the Company. 
    
  Product Recalls 
    
  From time to time, the Company cooperates with and assists its customers on their product recalls and inquiries, and occasionally receives inquiries directly from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) regarding reported incidents involving the Company s products. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigations or product recalls. 
    
  Environmental 
    
  The Company s operations are subject to certain Federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Although the Company believes its operations have been consistent with prevailing industry standards, and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, one or more of the Company s current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third-parties, have been affected by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation of these sites. 
    
  Litigation 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, regulatory agency inquiries and other claims. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. While these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods, it is management s opinion that, after final disposition, including anticipated insurance recoveries in certain cases, any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company beyond that provided in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , would not be material to the Company s financial position or annual results of operations.

  (Unaudited) 

The following reconciliation details the denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   exclude the effect of   219,302   and   284,884   shares of common stock, respectively, subject to stock-based performance awards. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   exclude the effect of   171,514   and   237,384   shares of common stock, respectively, subject to stock-based performance awards. Such shares were excluded from total diluted shares because they were anti-dilutive or the specified performance conditions those shares were subject to were not yet achieved. 
    
  On   April 15, 2016  ,   June 17, 2016   and   September 2, 2016  , a dividend of   $0.30   per share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate of   $7.3 million  ,   $7.4 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, was paid to stockholders of record as of   April 1, 2016  ,   June 6, 2016   and   August 19, 2016  , respectively. In connection with these dividends, holders of deferred stock units, restricted stock and stock awards were credited with deferred stock units, restricted stock or stock equal to   $0.30   for each deferred stock unit, share of restricted stock or stock award, representing   $0.3 million   for each of these dividends, respectively. 
    
  On   April 10, 2015  , a special dividend of   $2.00   per share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate of   $48.2 million  , was paid to stockholders of record as of   March 27, 2015  . In connection with this special dividend, holders of deferred stock units, restricted stock and stock awards were credited with deferred stock units, restricted stock or stock equal to   $2.00   for each deferred stock unit, share of restricted stock or stock award, representing   $1.8   million in total for this special dividend. In connection with this special cash dividend, the exercise price of all outstanding stock options was reduced by   $2.00   per share. The reductions in exercise price were made pursuant to the terms of the outstanding awards, resulting in no incremental stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  In   February 2016  , the Company issued   4,784   deferred stock units at the average price of   $55.22  , or   $0.3 million  , to executive officers in lieu of cash for a portion of their 2015 incentive compensation. In   February 2015  , the Company issued   36,579   deferred stock units at the average price of   $55.95  , or   $2.0 million  , to executive officers in lieu of cash for a portion of their 2014 incentive compensation. 

10.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Recurring 
    
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at: 

17 

    DREW INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Deferred Compensation 
    
  The Company has an Executive Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the  Plan ). The amounts deferred under the Plan are credited with earnings or losses based upon changes in values of the notional investments elected by the Plan participants. The Company invests approximately   65 percent   of the amounts deferred by the Plan participants in life insurance contracts, matching the investments elected by the Plan participants. Deferred compensation assets and liabilities were valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. 
    
  Contingent Consideration Related to Acquisitions 
    
  Liabilities for contingent consideration related to acquisitions were fair valued using management s projections for long-term sales forecasts, including assumptions regarding market share gains, foreign currency rates and future industry-specific economic and market conditions, and a market participant s weighted average cost of capital. Over the next   six years  , the Company s long-term sales growth forecasts for products subject to contingent consideration arrangements average approximately   15 percent   per year. For further information on the inputs used in determining the fair value, and a roll-forward of the contingent consideration liability, see Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Changes in either of the inputs in isolation would result in a change in the fair value measurement. A change in the assumptions used for sales forecasts would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value liability, while a change in the weighted average cost of capital would result in a directionally opposite change in the fair value liability. If there is an increase in the fair value liability, the Company would record a charge to selling, general and administrative expenses, and if there is a decrease in the fair value liability, the Company would record a benefit in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Non-recurring 
    
  The following table presents the carrying value on the measurement date of any assets and liabilities which were measured at fair value and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, on a non-recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), and the corresponding non-recurring losses or (gains) recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Vacant Owned Facilities 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of   one   vacant owned facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   vacant owned facility, with an estimated fair value of over   $3.0 million   and a carrying value of   $2.5 million  , classified in fixed assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , the Company reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of   three   vacant owned facilities, of which   one   of these facilities was sold and   one   was reopened. At   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   one   vacant owned facility, with an estimated fair value of $  3.0   million and a carrying value of   $2.5 million  , classified in fixed assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The determination of fair value was based on the best information available, including internal cash flow estimates, market prices for similar assets, broker quotes and independent appraisals, as appropriate. 
    
  Net Assets of Acquired Businesses 
    
  The Company valued the assets and liabilities associated with the acquisitions of businesses on the respective acquisition dates. Depending upon the type of asset or liability acquired, the Company used different valuation techniques in determining the fair value. Those techniques included comparable market prices, long-term sales, profitability and cash flow forecasts, assumptions

regarding future industry-specific economic and market conditions, a market participant s weighted average cost of capital, as well as other techniques as circumstances required. For further information on acquired assets and liabilities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

11.    SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  The Company previously had   two   reportable segments, the recreational vehicle products segment (the  RV Segment ) and the manufactured housing products segment (the  MH Segment ).   The Company has recently increased its focus on the significant opportunities in the aftermarket for its products, primarily sales to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers. Additionally, over the past several years, sales of components for manufactured homes have become a smaller part of the Company s business, largely due to the growth the Company has experienced with respect to its components sold to customers for traditional recreational vehicles as well as the expanded use of its components in other non-RV applications, which we refer to as adjacent industries. Unit growth for MH Segment products has also been lower over the last decade, primarily due to the real estate, credit and economic environment, including the availability of site built homes at stable prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site-built homes and loans for manufactured homes. In response to these changes in the Company s business, subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company modified its internal reporting structure, reflecting a change in how its chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) assesses the performance of the Company s operating results and make decisions about resource allocations. The Company s new reportable segments are the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment. Intersegment sales are insignificant. 
    
  The OEM Segment, which accounted for   92 percent   and   93 percent   of consolidated net sales for each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   manufactures or distributes a broad array of components for the leading OEMs of RVs and adjacent industries, including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; manufactured homes; modular housing; and mobile office units.   Approximately   71 percent   of the Company s OEM Segment net sales for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   were of components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. 
    
  The Aftermarket Segment, which accounted for   8 percent   and   7 percent   of consolidated net sales for each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, supplies   components to the related aftermarket channels of the RV and adjacent industries, primarily to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers. The Aftermarket Segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. 
    
  Decisions concerning the allocation of the Company s resources are made by the Company s CODM, with oversight by the Board of Directors. The CODM evaluates the performance of each segment based upon segment operating profit or loss, generally defined as income or loss before interest and income taxes. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources are also based on each segment s utilization of assets. Management of debt is a corporate function. The accounting policies of the OEM and Aftermarket Segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended     December 31, 2015  . The change in reported segments had no effect on the Company s net income, total assets or liabilities, or stockholders  equity.

12.    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which amends ASC 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  . This ASU provides guidance on the statement of cash flows presentation of certain transactions where diversity in practice exists. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amended ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  . This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . This ASU requires, in most instances, a lessee to recognize on its balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and also a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods, using a modified retrospective approach with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   This ASU requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company elected to retrospectively adopt ASU 2015-17, thus reclassifying current deferred tax assets to non-current on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, the Company reclassified   $18,709   and   $22,616   from current assets to long-term assets as of   September 30,   2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The adoption of this guidance has no impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   This ASU applies to inventory measured using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . This ASU requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB issued an ASU that allows the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to continue to be an asset on the balance sheet under the simplified guidance, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the related arrangements. The amendments in these ASUs are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted these ASUs retrospectively effective January 1, 2016, and have reclassified all debt issuance costs, with the exception of those related to the revolving credit facility, as a reduction from  
  
   20 

    DREW INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

the carrying amount of the related debt liability for both current and prior periods. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This ASU provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for years beginning after December 15, 2016, to be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Report, as well as the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Drew Industries Incorporated ( Drew , and collectively with its subsidiaries, the  Company ),   through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Lippert Components  or  LCI ), supplies a broad array of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) of recreational vehicles ( RVs ) and adjacent industries including   buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; manufactured homes; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units  . The Company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company operated   45   manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the United States and in Canada and Italy. 
    
  The Company previously had two reportable segments, the recreational vehicle products segment (the  RV Segment ) and the manufactured housing products segment (the  MH Segment ).

  Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Additionally, sales of components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counter-seasonal. 
    
  INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
    
  OEM 
    
  Recreational Vehicle Industry 
    
  An RV is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers). 
  The annual sales cycle for the RV industry generally starts in October after the  Open House  in Elkhart, Indiana where many of the largest RV OEMs display product to RV retail dealers, and ends after the conclusion of the summer selling season in September in the following calendar year. Between October and March, industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded retail sales as dealers build inventories to support anticipated sales. Between April and September, the spring and summer selling seasons, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded industry-wide wholesale shipments. Based on the strength of retail sales and the current outlook from several RV OEMs and their dealer networks, most industry analysts continue to report that RV dealer inventory is in line with anticipated retail demand. 
  According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ( RVIA ), industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs in the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company s primary RV market,   increased     14 percent   to   272,400   units, compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , as a result of: 
             
    An estimated   20,800   unit   increase   in retail demand in the first   nine   months of   2016  , or   eight percent  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . In addition, retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months, primarily due to delayed RV registrations. 
                
    Partially offset by RV dealers seasonally decreasing inventory levels by an estimated   15,600   units in the first   nine   months of   2016  , lower than the decrease in inventory levels of   27,800   units in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
       
  While the Company measures its OEM Segment RV sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. A comparison of the number of units and the year-over-year percentage change in industry-wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories, for both the United States and Canada, is as follows:

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (Continued) 

(1)   
    Retail sales data for   September     2016   has not been published; therefore retail and dealer inventory data includes a Company estimate for retail units sold in   September  . 
       
  According to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhome RVs in the first   nine   months of   2016   increased   16 percent   to   41,600   units compared to the same period of   2015  . The Company estimates retail demand for motorhome RVs increased eight percent in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  The RVIA has projected an eight percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs for 2016. Further, the RVIA has also projected a one percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs for 2017. Several RV OEMs, however, are introducing new product lines, additional features and adding production capacity. Retail sales of RVs historically have been closely tied to general economic conditions, as well as consumer confidence which was above historical averages in 2015. Additionally, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have increased in 81 of the last 83 months on a year-over-year basis. Industry resources report strong attendance and high consumer interest at RV shows around the United States in late 2015 and into 2016. The U.S. dollar, which has appreciated by more than 20     percent since the beginning of 2014, has impacted sales in Canada as total RV shipments to Canada represent approximately 10 percent of total North American RV shipments, down from historical levels of approximately 18 percent. 
  Although future retail demand is inherently uncertain, RV industry fundamentals in the first   nine   months of   2016  , including generally low unemployment, low fuel prices and available credit for dealers and RV consumers, were strong, as evidenced by the   eight percent   increase in industry-wide retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs in the first   nine   months of   2016  . The Company believes the strong RV industry fundamentals, aided by product innovation, demographic tailwinds, industry promotion and the advent of stronger dealer networks, are positive signs for the remainder of   2016  . The Company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new product introductions, market share gains, aftermarket sales, acquisitions and ongoing investments in research and development, engineering, quality and customer service.

  The Company s portfolio of products used in RVs can also be used in other applications, including   buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; manufactured homes; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units   (collectively,  Adjacent Industries ). In many cases, OEM customers of the Adjacent Industries are affiliated with RV OEMs through related subsidiaries. The Company believes there are significant opportunities in these Adjacent Industries and, as a result, four of the last six business acquisitions completed by the Company were focused in Adjacent Industries. 
    
  The estimated potential content per unit the Company may supply to the Adjacent Industries varies by OEM product and differs from RVs and motorhomes. As a means to understand the potential of each of these markets, management reviews the number of retail units sold. The following are key target markets for Adjacent Industries component sales:

Aftermarket 
    
  Many of the Company s OEM Segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels, including dealerships, warehouse distributors and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers. The Company has teams dedicated to product training and marketing support for its Aftermarket customers. The Company also supports two call centers to provide quick responses to customers for both product delivery and technical support. This support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs so customer downtime is minimized. The Aftermarket Segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. Many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacements are purchased outside the normal product selling seasons, thereby causing Aftermarket sales to be counter-seasonal. 
    
  Following the last recession, approximately 1.9 million RVs have been built and sold, bringing current estimated RV ownership up to nearly nine million units, according to the RVIA. Additionally, as a result of a vibrant secondary market, one-third of current owners purchased their RV new while the remaining two-thirds purchased a previously owned RV. This vibrant secondary market is a key driver for the aftermarket, as the Company anticipates owners of previously owned RVs will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Highlights 

Consolidated net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased to   $412 million  ,   19 percent   higher than the   2015     third   quarter. The increase in year-over-year net sales reflects industry-wide growth in wholesale shipments of towable RVs by OEMs, which increased by   20   percent in the   third   quarter of   2016  , enhanced by acquisitions completed by the Company over the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , which added $13 million in net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
                
    OEM Segment net sales increased   19 percent  , or   $61 million  , while Aftermarket Segment net sales increased   21 percent  , or   $6 million  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
                 
    Consolidated operating profits increased to   $45.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $27.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Operating profit margin increased to   10.9 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   7.9 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increased profitability is the result of several factors, primarily including higher sales leading to better overhead utilization, the impact of lower material costs, accretive acquisitions in both 2015 and 2016, cost management initiatives and changes in product sales mix including growth in the aftermarket. 
                
    The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure. The Company seeks to continuously manage its labor cost, particularly indirect labor, while supporting the growth of the business. Lean manufacturing teams continue working to reduce cost and implement processes to better utilize available floorspace. The Company has also reduced direct labor attrition which improves efficiency and reduces other costs associated with workforce turnover. 
                
    The cost of aluminum and steel used in certain of the Company s manufactured components declined during the second half of 2015 and continued into 2016; however, certain commodities have experienced cost increases in the second and   third   quarters of   2016   from market low points. Raw material costs continue to fluctuate and are expected to remain volatile.

Thus far in   2016  , the Company completed three acquisitions, all of which have been accretive to earnings: 
                
    Project 2000 S.r.l. -- An Italian manufacturer of innovative, space-saving bed lifts and retractable steps, with estimated annual sales of $14 million, completed May 2016; 
                
    Flair Interiors -- A Goshen, Indiana manufacturer of RV furniture, with estimated annual sales of $25 million, completed February 2016; and 
                
    Highwater Marine Furniture -- An Elkhart, Indiana marine furniture operation providing furniture solutions for Highwater Marine, LLC, a manufacturer of pontoon boats. Estimated annual sales for the marine furniture operation were $20 million, completed January 2016. 
     Integration activities for these acquired businesses are underway and proceeding in line with established plans. The Company plans to grow sales and leverage its purchasing power, manufacturing capabilities, engineering expertise and design resources to improve the cost structure of the acquired operations. 
  Additionally, in October 2016, the Company agreed to acquire the business, manufacturing facility and certain assets of the seating and chassis components business of Atwood Mobile Products, LLC, a subsidiary of Dometic Group. Net sales of the business in 2015 were approximately $30 million. After funding these acquisitions, the Company believes it has access to sufficient financial capital and staff to take advantage of additional investment opportunities. 

OEM Segment -   Third   Quarter 
    
  Net sales of the OEM Segment in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased   19   percent, or   $61 million  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net sales of components to OEMs were to the following markets for the three months ended   September 30  : 

According to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale unit shipments for the three months ended   September 30,   were: 

The Company s net sales growth in components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during the   third   quarter of   2016   exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs during the same period, primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first nine months of   2016  . 
    
  The Company s net sales growth in components for motorhomes during the   third   quarter of   2016   exceeded the increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes during the same period primarily due to acquisitions completed during 2016. Over the past few years, the Company has been expanding its product line of components for motorhomes in order to increase its customer base and market penetration, and further growth is expected.

The trend in the Company s average product content per RV produced is an indicator of the Company s overall market share of components for new RVs. The Company s average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon the Company s net sales of components to RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the twelve months ended   September 30  , divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different types of RVs for the same period, was: 

The Company s average product content per type of RV excludes sales to the Aftermarket and Adjacent Industries. Content per RV is impacted by market share gains, acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in selling prices for the Company s products, as well as changes in the types of RVs produced industry-wide. 
    
  The Company s net OEM sales to Adjacent Industries   increased   during the   third   quarter of   2016  , primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2015 and the first   nine   months of   2016  , which added $5 million, and market share gains. The Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in Adjacent Industries. 
    
  Operating profit of the OEM Segment was   $39.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , an improvement of   $16.6 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The operating profit margin of the OEM Segment in the   third   quarter of   2016   was positively impacted by: 
             
    Better fixed cost absorption by spreading fixed costs over a   $61 million   larger sales base. 
                
    Increasing sales to Adjacent Industries OEMs. 
                
    Lower material costs for certain raw materials. Steel and aluminum costs declined in the second half of 2015 and continued into 2016. Costs for these commodities experienced some increases in the second and third quarters of 2016. Material costs, which are subject to global supply and demand forces, are expected to remain volatile. 
                
    Sales mix changes of products, including increased sales of fifth-wheel products. 
                
    Indirect labor cost savings initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce such costs on an annualized basis. 
                
    Investments over the past several years to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies. Further, the Company has implemented efficiency improvements, including lean manufacturing initiatives, increased use of automation and employee retention initiatives.   The Company has also reduced direct labor attrition which improves efficiency and reduces other costs associated with workforce turnover. 
                
    Lower group health and workers  compensation claims. The Company actively works to manage and reduce these costs, however, these costs remain subject to fluctuation. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Fixed costs which were approximately $1 million to $2 million higher than in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   Over the past couple of years, the Company made significant investments in manufacturing capacity, both facilities and personnel, to prepare for the expected increase in net sales in     2016   and beyond. In addition to investments in fixed costs to expand manufacturing capacity, the Company has made improvements in marketing, human resources, engineering, customer service and other critical departments. The Company also added the teams from acquired businesses, as well amortization costs of intangible assets related to those businesses. 
                
    While the Company seeks to continuously manage its labor cost, it has added staff to support the growth of the business. The results also reflect variable compensation increases based on achieving profitability targets.

Aftermarket Segment -   Third   Quarter 
    
  Net sales of the Aftermarket Segment in the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     21 percent  , or   $6 million  , compared to the same period of   2015  . Net sales of components were as follows for the three months ended   September 30  : 

The Company s net sales to the Aftermarket increased during the   third   quarter of   2016     primarily due to the Company s focus on building out well qualified, customer-focused teams and infrastructure to service this market. With an estimated nine million households in North America owning an RV and the Company s increasing content per unit, the Company continues to believe there are significant opportunities in the RV aftermarket as the components sold to OEMs are subject to normal wear and tear over time. 
    
  Operating profit of the Aftermarket Segment was   $6.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $1.4 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  ,   primarily due to the increase in net sales and the higher margins traditionally experienced in aftermarket channels.   This business is still in an early growth stage and the Company has added staff to support anticipated growth in areas including sales and marketing, customer service, order fulfillment and overall management.

Generally, calendar years 2013 - 2015 remain open for federal and state income tax purposes. The Company is currently being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended December 31, 2014. 
  The net amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months due to changes in audit status, expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements of tax assessments and other events which could impact our determination of unrecognized tax benefits. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, we may resolve certain tax matters within the next twelve months and pay amounts for other unresolved tax matters in order to limit the potential impact of interest charges. The resolution of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the following for the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Cash Flows from Operations 
    
  Net cash flows from operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $119.4 million   higher than the same period of   2015  , primarily due to: 
              
    A $31.8 million larger increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to the timing of payments. 
                
    A   decrease   in inventories of   $13.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to an increase of   $39.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   decrease   in inventories in the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to an inventory reduction initiative. Inventory turnover for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   7.3   turns compared to   September 30, 2015   at   7.2   turns. The Company is working to improve inventory turnover over the coming quarters, however, inventory turns may trend lower due to growth in product categories such as import furniture and Furrion electronics. 
                
    A   $3.1 million   increase in depreciation and amortization due to the investments in acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    A   $5.3 million   larger seasonal   increase   in accounts receivable in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . This larger increase was primarily due to   increase  d net sales partially offset by the timing of payments by the Company s customers. Overall, accounts receivable balances remain current, with an average of 19 days sales outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Over the long term, based on the Company s historical collection and payment patterns, as well as inventory turnover, and also giving consideration to emerging trends and changes to the sales mix, the Company expects working capital to increase or decrease equivalent to approximately 11 - 14 percent of the increase or decrease, respectively, in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact this relationship, especially in the short term. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization was   $33.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , and is expected to aggregate $42 million to $47 million for the full year   2016  . Non-cash stock-based compensation in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $11.4 million  , including   $0.3 million   of deferred stock units issued to certain executive officers in lieu of cash for a portion of their   2015   incentive compensation in accordance with their compensation arrangements. Non-cash stock-based compensation is expected to be approximately $15 million to $17 million for the full year   2016  .

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used for investing activities of   $55.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   were primarily comprised of   $21.9 million   for capital expenditures and   $34.2 million   for the acquisition of businesses. Cash flows used for investing activities of   $61.0 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015   were primarily comprised of   $21.8 million   for capital expenditures and   $41.1 million   for the acquisition of businesses. 
  In   January 2016  , the Company acquired the business and certain assets of the pontoon furniture manufacturing operation of Highwater Marine, a manufacturer of pontoon boats located in Elkhart, Indiana. The purchase price was   $10.0 million   paid at closing. 
  In   February 2016  , the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Flair Interiors, a manufacturer of RV furniture. The purchase price was   $8.1 million   paid at closing. 
  In   May 2016  , the Company acquired   100 percent   of the equity interest of Project 2000 S.r.l. ( Project 2000 ), an Italy-based manufacturer of innovative, space-saving bed lifts and retractable steps. The purchase price was   $18.8 million   paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales by this operation. 
  The Company s capital expenditures are primarily for replacement and growth. Over the long term, based on the Company s historical capital expenditures, the replacement portion has averaged approximately two percent of net sales, while the growth portion has averaged approximately 10 - 12 percent of the annual increase in net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact the actual spending compared to these historical averages. In the first   nine   months of   2016   capital expenditures of   $21.9 million   were in line with historical averages. As such, coupled with the success achieved in lean manufacturing to free up additional manufacturing space, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet the increased manufacturing demands expected for 2016 and into 2017 with capital expenditures at or below historical levels. 
  The Company estimates capital expenditures will be $28 million to $32 million in   2016  , including $15 million to $17 million of  replacement  capital expenditures and $13 million to $15 million of  growth  capital expenditures. Additional capital expenditures may be required in   2016   depending on the extent of the sales growth, the impact of any acquisitions and other initiatives by the Company. 
  The capital expenditures and acquisitions during the first   nine   months of   2016   were funded from operations and periodic borrowings under the Company s line of credit. The capital expenditures for the balance of   2016   are expected to be funded primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as periodic borrowings under the Company s line of credit as necessary. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flows used for financing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   were primarily comprised of payments of dividends of   $0.30   per share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate of   $7.3 million  ,   $7.4 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, paid to stockholders of record as of   April 1, 2016  ,   June 6, 2016   and   August 19, 2016  , respectively. In addition, the Company received   $3.6 million   in cash and the related tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, which was more than offset by   $3.2 million   of shares tendered for payment of taxes. Further, the Company paid   $2.7 million   in contingent consideration related to acquisitions. 
  Cash flows provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2015 were primarily comprised of a net increase in indebtedness of $76.2 million partially offset by the payment of a special dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate of $48.2 million, paid to stockholders of record as of March 27, 2015. The increase in indebtedness included new debt comprised of $50.0 million of Senior Promissory Notes drawn in March 2015 under the Prudential Investment Management, Inc.  shelf-loan  facility, as well as a $26.2 million net increase in outstanding borrowings under the Company s line of credit. Borrowings under the Company s line of credit reached a high of $71.6 million during the first nine months of 2015. In addition, the Company paid $4.0 million in contingent consideration related to acquisitions. 
  In connection with certain business acquisitions, if established sales targets for the acquired business is achieved, the Company will pay additional cash consideration. The Company has recorded a   $11.5 million   liability for the aggregate fair value of these expected contingent consideration liabilities at   September 30, 2016  , including   $5.0 million   recorded as a current liability.

The maximum borrowings under the line of credit can be further increased by     $125.0 million  ,   subject to certain conditions.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.5 million   in outstanding, but undrawn, standby letters of credit under the line of credit. Availability under the Company s line of credit was   $197.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  On April 27, 2016, the Company also amended and restated its   $150.0 million    shelf-loan  facility with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and its affiliates ( Prudential )     to conform certain covenants and other terms to the Amended Credit Agreement.   The facility provides for Prudential to consider purchasing, at the Company s request, in one or a series of transactions, Senior Promissory Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of up to  $150.0 million  , to mature no more than   12 years   after the date of original issue of each Senior Promissory Note. Prudential has no obligation to purchase the Senior Promissory Notes.     On March 20, 2015, the Company issued     $50.0 million   of Senior Promissory Notes to Prudential for a term of   five   years, at a fixed interest rate of   3.35 percent   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, of which the entire amount was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Availability under the Company s  shelf-loan  facility, subject to the approval of Prudential, was   $100.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .   The undrawn  shelf-loan  facility expires February 24, 2017. The Company is considering renewal options. 
  Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement and  shelf-loan  facility, the Company is required to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages, and to meet certain other financial requirements. At     September 30, 2016  ,   the Company was in compliance with all such requirements, and expects to remain in compliance for the next twelve months. 
  Availability under both the Amended Credit Agreement and the  shelf-loan  facility is subject to a maximum leverage ratio covenant which limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness to     2.5     times the trailing twelve-month EBITDA, as defined. This limitation did not impact the Company s borrowing availability at     September 30, 2016  . The remaining availability under these facilities, not including the potential increase of $125 million under the Amended Credit Agreement, was   $297.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  .   The Company believes the availability under the Amended Credit Agreement and  shelf-loan  facility is adequate to finance the Company s anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. 
  Additional information on the Company s Amended Credit Agreement and  shelf-loan  facility is included in Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
    
  The Company is in compliance with the corporate governance requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the New York Stock Exchange. The Company s governance documents and committee charters and key practices have been posted to the Company s website (www.drewindustries.com) and are updated periodically. The website also contains, or provides direct links to, all SEC filings, press releases and investor presentations. The Company has also established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes a toll-free hotline (877-373-9123) to report complaints about the Company s accounting, internal controls, auditing matters or other concerns. The Whistleblower Policy and procedure for complaints can be found on the Company s website (www.drewindustries.com). 
    
  CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Information required by this item is included in Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and under Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  INFLATION 
    
  The prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of steel and aluminum, and components used by the Company which are made from these raw materials, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures. Prices of these commodities have historically been volatile, and over the past few months prices have continued to fluctuate. The Company did not experience any significant increases in its labor costs in the first   nine   months of   2016   related to inflation. 
    
  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Information required by this item is included in Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  USE OF ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets, net assets of acquired businesses, income taxes, warranty and product recall obligations, self-insurance obligations, lease terminations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, contingent consideration, environmental liabilities, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, other available information and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other resources. Actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates. 
    
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  with respect to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive position, growth opportunities, acquisitions, plans and objectives of management and other matters. Statements in this Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are  forward-looking statements  for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. 
    
  Forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the Company s future business prospects, net sales, expenses and income (loss), cash flow, and financial condition, whenever they occur in this Form 10-Q are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of the Company s senior management at the time such statements were made. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, in addition to other matters described in this Form 10-Q, pricing pressures due to domestic and foreign competition, costs and availability of raw materials (particularly steel, steel based components and aluminum) and other components, seasonality and cyclicality in the industries to which the Company sells its products, availability of credit for financing the retail and wholesale purchase of products for which the Company sells its components, inventory levels of retail dealers and manufacturers, availability of transportation for products for which the Company sells its components, the financial condition of the Company s customers, the financial condition of retail dealers of products for which the Company sells its components, retention and concentration of significant customers, the costs, pace of and successful integration of acquisitions and other growth initiatives, availability and costs of labor, employee benefits, employee retention, realization and impact of efficiency improvements and cost reductions, the successful entry into new markets, the costs of compliance with environmental laws and increased governmental regulation and oversight, information technology performance and security, the ability to protect intellectual property, interest rates, oil and gasoline prices, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on the retail sale of products for which the Company sells its components, and other risks and uncertainties discussed more fully under the caption  Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and in the Company s subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made, except as required by law.

DREW INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
  ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 
  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $50.0 million   of fixed rate debt outstanding. Assuming there is a decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , which the Company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short-term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing, future cash flows would be approximately $0.5 million lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates. 
  The Company is also exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials, specifically steel and aluminum. The Company may, from time to time, enter into derivative instruments for the purpose of managing a portion of the exposures associated with fluctuations in commodity prices, such as steel and aluminum. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no derivative instruments outstanding. 
  The Company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to partially offset the majority of raw material cost increases. However, there can be no assurance future cost increases, if any, can be partially or fully passed on to customers, or that the timing of such sales price increases will match raw material cost increases. 
  Additional information required by this item is included under the caption  Inflation  in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Report. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
           a) 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, in accordance with the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Management included in its evaluation the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company continually evaluates its disclosure controls and procedures to determine if changes are appropriate based upon changes in the Company s operations or the business environment in which it operates. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and the Company s principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
           b) 
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
     There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  The Company has selected a new enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system. Implementation of the new ERP software began in late 2013. To date, 21 locations have been put on this ERP software. The roll-out plan is continually evaluated in the context of priorities for the business and may change as needs of the business dictate. The Company anticipates enhancements to controls due to both the installation of the new ERP software and business process changes resulting therefrom.

  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, regulatory agency inquiries and other claims. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. While these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods, it is management s opinion that after final disposition, including anticipated insurance recoveries in certain cases, any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company beyond that provided in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  , would not be material to the Company s financial position or annual results of operations. 

ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORS 
  There have been no material changes to the matters discussed in Part I, Item 1A   Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016.
