NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

1.      Basis of Presentation 

The interim consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared by Universal Hospital Services, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  us , the  Company , or  UHS ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to such rules and regulations.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 

The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein as of September 30, 2016, reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  These adjustments are all of a normal, recurring nature.  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 

We are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events in preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  While we believe that our past estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate, our current estimates are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events are made.  We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicate those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  We make adjustments to our assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate.  Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

A description of our significant accounting policies is included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these policies for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UHS and its 100%-owned subsidiary, UHS Surgical Services, Inc. ( Surgical Services ). In addition, in accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), we have accounted for our equity investments in entities in which we are the primary beneficiary under the full consolidation method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated through consolidation. As the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the limited liability companies ( LLCs ) referred to in Note 10, Limited Liability Companies, as we effectively receive the majority of the benefits from such entities and we provide equipment lease guarantees for such entities. 

2.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Standards Adopted 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ) to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires an entity with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented.   

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is   

6 

Table of Contents  

effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-03 to all periods presented. As a result, $10.3 million of deferred financing costs in other long-term assets were netted to long-term debt on the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 changes the evaluation of whether limited partnerships (and similar legal entities) are variable interest entities (VIEs) and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership that is a voting interest entity. The new guidance also alters the analysis for determining when fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represent a variable interest in a VIE and how interests of related parties affect the primary beneficiary determination. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Standards Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in the GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.     On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU 2014-09, but would permit companies to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    ( ASU 2014-15 ), which requires management to evaluate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and whether or not it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The new standard is effective beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-03 changes the measurement principle for inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value for entities that do not measure inventory using the last in, first out or retail inventory method. The ASU also eliminates the requirement for these entities to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 on   Leases   (Topic 842)     ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ). ASU 2016-08 amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , and clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods and services before they are transferred to the customer. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not before annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-08 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and intends to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted. If an entity early adopts the ASU in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09 about identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The ASU is effective on adoption of ASU 2014-09. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-12 makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU 2014-09 and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and to clarify certain aspects of the standard. The ASU is effective on adoption of ASU 2014-09. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

3.      Fair Value Measurements 

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table by type of inputs applicable to the fair value measurements: 

A description of the inputs used in the valuation of assets and liabilities is summarized as follows: 

Level 1   Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. 

Level 2   Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that are considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3   Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities or related observable inputs that can be corroborated at the measurement date. Measurements of non-exchange traded derivative contract assets and liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities.

During 2012, we recorded a contingent consideration liability, in the form of an earn-out payment, related to our acquisitions. During 2015, we recorded a holdback liability related to our acquisition. The contingent consideration and holdback payments are based on achieving certain revenue results. The fair value of the liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement  .    The significant inputs in the Level 3 measurement not supported by market activity included our assessments of expected future cash flows during the earn-out period, related to the assets acquired, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, and calculated based on estimated revenues in accordance with the terms of the agreements. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made no payment in earn-outs and holdback.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid $0.5 and $0.02 million, respectively, in earn-outs and holdback.   

The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow analysis included estimates of interest rates and the timing and amount of incremental cash flows. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the Level 3 measurement are as follows: 

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The Company considers that the carrying amount of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and senior secured credit facility, approximates fair value due to their short maturities. The fair value of our outstanding Original Notes and Add-on Notes (each as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues of debt, which represents a Level 2 fair value measurement, is approximately: 

(1) The carrying value of the Original notes - 7.625% is net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $4.8 and $5.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

(2) The carrying value of the Add-on notes - 7.625% is net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $2.0 and $2.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and includes unamortized bond premium of $8.1 and $9.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

4.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Our goodwill as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, by reporting segment, consists of the following:

Table of Contents  

Our other intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following: 

Total amortization expense related to intangible assets were $2.6 and $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8.4 and $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The estimated future amortization expense for identifiable intangible assets during the remainder of 2016 and the next five years is as follows: 

5.      Deficit 

The following tables represent changes in deficit that are attributable to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

6.      Share-Based Compensation 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, activity under the 2007 Stock Option Plan (the  2007 Stock Option Plan ), of UHS Holdco, Inc., our parent company ( Parent ), was as follows: 

The exercise price of the stock option award is equal to the market value of Parent s common stock on the grant date as determined reasonably and in good faith by Parent s Board of Directors and compensation committee and based on an analysis of a variety of factors, including peer group multiples, merger and acquisition multiples, and discounted cash flow analyses. 

The intrinsic value of a stock award is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the award. 

We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated fair value of options, including the effect of estimated forfeitures, is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the options  expected vesting periods. The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 under the Black-Scholes model.  

Expected volatility is based on an independent valuation of the stock of companies within our peer group. Given the lack of a true comparable company, the peer group consists of selected public health care companies representing our suppliers, customers and competitors within certain product lines. The risk free-interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date based on the expected option life. The expected option life is estimated based on foreseeable trends.  

At September 30, 2016, unearned non-cash share-based compensation that we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of 1.9 years totals approximately $5.5 million, net of our estimated forfeiture rate of 2.0%. The expense could be accelerated upon the sale of Parent or the Company. 

In April 2015, Parent granted the Company s Chief Executive Officer 7.0 million restricted stock units which vest over four years. Total compensation expense related to this grant was $0.3 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.9 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Although Parent grants stock options and restricted stock units, the Company recognizes compensation cost, primarily included in Selling, General and Administrative expense, related to these options and units since the services are performed for its benefit. 

7.      Long-Term Debt 

Long-term debt consists of the following: 

Original Notes and Add-on Notes   7.625%.    On August 7, 2012, we issued $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  Original Notes ) under an indenture dated as of August 7, 2012 (the  2012 Indenture ). On February 12, 2013, we issued $220.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  Add-on Notes , and along with the Original Notes, the  2012 Notes ) as  additional notes  pursuant to the 2012 Indenture. The 2012 Notes mature on August 15, 2020. 

The 2012 Indenture provides that the 2012 Notes are our second lien senior secured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by our existing and certain of our future 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. 

Interest on the 2012 Notes is payable entirely in cash, semiannually, in arrears, on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2013. We may redeem some or all of the 2012 Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the 2012 Indenture.  If we sell certain assets or undergo certain kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the 2012 Notes.  

Our 2012 Notes are subject to certain debt covenants which are described below under the heading  2012 Indenture . 

Senior Secured Credit Facility.    On November 24, 2015, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for the lenders, and the lenders party thereto (the  Third Amended Credit Agreement ), which amended our then-existing senior secured credit facility originally dated as of May 31, 2007 and amended and restated as of May 6, 2010 and as of July 31, 2012.  We refer to the third amended and restated senior secured credit facility as the  senior secured credit facility.  The senior secured credit facility is a first lien senior secured asset based revolving credit facility that is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments, on a fully revolving basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the credit documents in the form of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit. The Third Amended Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the revolving loans to the earliest of (i) November 24, 2020 and (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity of the 2012 Notes, and reduced (a) the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Third Amended Credit Agreement to a per annum rate, determined based on our usage of the credit facility as provided in the Third Amended Credit Agreement, ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% above the adjusted LIBOR rate used by

the agent or, at our option, 0.50% to 1.00% above the Base Rate as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement and (b) the unused line fee rate to 0.25%.  Our obligations under the Third Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company, Parent and Surgical Services, excluding a pledge of the Company s and its subsidiaries  stock, any joint ventures and certain other exceptions. Our obligations under the Third Amended Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent and Surgical Services. 

Our senior secured credit facility provides the aggregate amount we may borrow under revolving loans up to $235.0 million, subject to our borrowing base. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $111.7 million of availability under the senior secured credit facility based on a borrowing base of $167.1 million less borrowings of $50.9 million and after giving effect to $4.5 million used for letters of credit. 

The senior secured credit facility requires our compliance with various affirmative and negative covenants. Pursuant to the affirmative covenants, we and Parent agreed to, among other things, deliver financial and other information to the administrative agent, provide notice of certain events (including events of default), pay our obligations, maintain our properties, maintain the security interest in the collateral for the benefit of the administrative agent and the lenders and maintain insurance. 

Among other restrictions, and subject to certain definitions and exceptions, the senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to: 

incur indebtedness;     

create or permit liens;     

declare or pay dividends and certain other restricted payments;     

consolidate, merge or recapitalize;     

acquire or sell assets;     

make certain investments, loans or other advances;     

enter into transactions with affiliates;     

change our line of business; and     

enter into hedging transactions.     

The senior secured credit facility also contains a financial covenant that is triggered if our available borrowing capacity is less than $20.0 million for a certain period, which consists of a minimum ratio of trailing four-quarter Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ) to cash interest expense, as such terms are defined in the senior secured credit facility. 

The senior secured credit facility specifies certain events of default, including, among others, failure to pay principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy events, certain ERISA-related events, cross-defaults to other material agreements, change of control events and invalidity of guarantees or security documents.  Some events of default will be triggered only after certain cure periods have expired, or will provide for materiality thresholds.  If such a default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility would be entitled to take various actions, including all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor and the acceleration of amounts due under the senior secured credit facility. 

At September 30, 2016, we had $50.9 million of borrowings outstanding of which $25.0 million was accruing interest at a rate of 2.5277%,  $14.0 million was accruing interest at a rate of 2.5182% and $11.9 million was accruing interest at a rate of 4.5%.   

We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants for all periods presented. 

2012 Indenture.   Our 2012 Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a second priority senior secured basis, by Surgical Services, and are also similarly guaranteed by certain of our future 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. The 2012 Notes are our second priority senior secured obligations and rank (i) equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness, and effectively senior to any such unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of collateral; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantors  existing and future subordinated

Table of Contents  

indebtedness; (iii) effectively junior to our senior secured credit facility; and (iv) structurally subordinated to any indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our future subsidiaries that are not guarantors. 

The 2012 Indenture governing the 2012 Notes contains covenants that limit our and our guarantors  ability, subject to certain definitions and exceptions, and certain of our future subsidiaries  ability to: 

incur additional indebtedness;     

pay cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or subordinated debt;     

issue redeemable stock or preferred stock;     

issue stock of subsidiaries;     

make certain investments;     

transfer or sell assets;     

create liens on our assets to secure debt;     

enter into transactions with affiliates; and     

merge or consolidate with another company.     

The 2012 Indenture specifies certain events of default, including among others, failure to pay principal, interest or premium, violation of covenants and agreements, cross-defaults to other material agreements, bankruptcy events, invalidity of guarantees, and a default in the performance by us of the security documents relating to the 2012 Indenture. Some events of default will be triggered only after certain grace or cure periods have expired, or provide for materiality thresholds. In the event certain bankruptcy-related defaults occur, the 2012 Notes will become due and payable immediately. If any other default occurs, the Trustee (and in some cases the noteholders) would be entitled to take various actions, including acceleration of amounts due under the 2012 Indenture. 

We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants for all periods presented. 

8.      Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company, in the ordinary course of business, could be subject to liability claims related to employees and the equipment that it rents and services. Asserted claims are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. Certain claims where the loss is probable, a provision is recorded based on the Company s best estimate. While the ultimate resolution of these actions may have an impact on the Company s financial results for a particular reporting period, management believes that any such resolution would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company and the chance of a negative outcome on outstanding litigation is considered remote. 

In May 2016,  the Company entered into an amendment to an agreement with a supplier. Between the original agreement and this amendment, certain end users  described in the original agreement have entered into a direct agreement with the supplier or have elected to participate in a group purchasing organization agreement with the supplier. As a result, the supplier agreed to make a payment of $2.75 million to the Company. The Company recorded a net gain of $2.75 million related to this settlement which is reflected as a Gain on settlement in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. 

On January 13, 2015, the Company filed suit in the Western District of Texas against Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and Hill-Rom Services, Inc. (the  Defendants ) alleging that the Defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws by willfully and unlawfully engaging in a pattern of exclusionary and predatory conduct in order to foreclose market competition and seeking actual damages, trebled damages and punitive damages.  On March 4, 2015, the Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to another venue.  On March 23, 2015, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case.  On July 2, 2015, the Court denied the Defendants  motion to transfer.  On October 15, 2015, the Court denied the Defendants motion to dismiss. The litigation is currently early in the discovery phase.

Management Agreement 

On May 31, 2007, we and an affiliate of Irving Place Capital (together with its affiliates,  IPC ) entered into a professional services agreement pursuant to which IPC provides general advisory and management services to us with respect to financial and operating matters.  IPC is a principal owner of Parent, and the following members of our board of directors are associated with IPC:  Robert Juneja and Bret Bowerman. The professional services agreement requires us to pay an annual fee for ongoing advisory and management services equal to the greater of $0.5 million or 0.75% of our Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the professional services agreement) for the immediately preceding fiscal year, payable in quarterly installments. The professional services agreement provides that IPC will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with certain activities undertaken pursuant to the professional services agreement and will be indemnified for liabilities incurred in connection with its role under the professional services agreement, other than for liabilities resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The term of the professional services agreement commenced on May 31, 2007 and will remain in effect unless and until either party notifies the other of its desire to terminate, we are sold to a third-party purchaser or we consummate a qualified initial public offering, as defined in the professional services agreement. Total professional services fees incurred to IPC were $0.2 and $0.2 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,  and $0.6 and $0.7 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We entered into engagement letters with CTPartners, LLC ( CTPartners ) to conduct searches for certain executive positions.  One member of our board of directors was a former director of CTPartners. No fees incurred to CTPartners for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Total fees incurred to CT Partners was $0 and $0.2 million during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In connection with the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, dated as of April 13, 2015, between an officer and the Company, we entered into a promissory note agreement with the officer dated April 13, 2016 for a total amount of $1.0 million which is included in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This note receivable bears annual interest at 1.45%. The principal and accrued interest of this note is due on the earliest of (i) the seventh anniversary of the date of this loan, (ii) any event with respect to borrower, which, in any such case of the loan were to remain outstanding on and after such date, would result in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (iii) and certain events of default or (iv) a change in control. Interest income for this note was $0.004 and $0.007 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. 

10.      Limited Liability Companies 

We participate with others in the formation of LLCs in which Surgical Services becomes a partner and shares the financial interest with the other investors. Surgical Services is the primary beneficiary of these LLCs. These LLCs acquire certain medical equipment for use in their respective business activities, which generally focus on surgical procedures. The LLCs will acquire medical equipment for rental purposes under equipment financing leases. At September 30, 2016, the LLCs had approximately $0.9 million of total assets. The third party investors in each respective LLC generally provide the lease financing company with individual proportionate lease guarantees based on their respective ownership percentages in the LLCs. In addition, Surgical Services will provide such financing companies with its corporate guarantee based on its respective ownership interest in each LLC. In certain instances, Surgical Services has provided such financing companies with an overall corporate guarantee in connection with equipment financing transactions. In such instances, the individual investors in each respective LLC will generally indemnify us against losses, if any, incurred in connection with its corporate guarantee. Additionally, we provide operational and administrative support to the LLCs in which it is a partner. As of September 30, 2016, we held interests in seven active LLCs. 

In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, we account for equity investments in LLCs (in which we are the primary beneficiary) under the full consolidation method whereby transactions between Surgical Services and the LLCs have been eliminated through consolidation.

12.      Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by scheduling the expected reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities in order to determine whether net operating loss carry forwards are recoverable prior to expiration and have established a valuation allowance in accordance with ASC Topic 740,     Income Taxes   . The tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily relates to state minimum fees. The expected tax benefit from operating loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was offset by the recording of additional valuation allowance. In future reporting periods, we will continue to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realizable. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had available unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $205.2 million. The net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2036. 

13.      Consolidating Financial Statements 

In accordance with the provisions of the 2012 Indenture, as a 100%-owned subsidiary of UHS, Surgical Services has jointly and severally guaranteed all the Company s Obligations (as defined in the 2012 Indenture) on a full and unconditional basis. Consolidating financial information of UHS and the guarantor is presented on the following pages.

Item 2.  Management s   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Our Company 

Universal Hospital Services, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  us , the  Company , or  UHS ) is a leading nationwide provider of health care technology management and service solutions to the United States health care industry. We provide our customers comprehensive health care technology management, service and clinical solutions that we believe help reduce capital and operating expenses, increase medical equipment and staff productivity, and support improved patient safety and outcomes. 

We commenced operations in 1939, originally incorporated in Minnesota in 1954 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. All of our outstanding capital stock is owned by UHS Holdco, Inc. ( Parent ), which acquired the Company in a recapitalization in May 2007.  Parent is controlled by affiliates of IPC. 

UHS delivers health care solutions through three segments: Medical Equipment Solutions ( MES ), Clinical Engineering Solutions ( CES ) and Surgical Services ( SS ). As of September 30, 2016, we owned or managed over 700,000 units of medical equipment consisting of approximately 400,000 owned or managed units in our MES segment, over 300,000 units of customer-owned equipment we managed in our CES segment and over 7,000 units of owned or managed mobile surgical equipment in our SS segment. Our diverse customer base includes more than 7,000 national, regional and local acute care hospitals and alternate site providers (such as long-term acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, surgery centers, specialty hospitals, nursing homes and home care providers). We also have relationships with more than 200 medical device manufacturers, many of the nation s largest group purchasing organizations ( GPOs ) and many health system integrated delivery networks ( IDNs ).  All of our solutions leverage our nationwide network of 83 district service centers, five CES Centers of Excellence and an additional five stand-alone SS service centers, together with our more than 75 years of experience managing and servicing all aspects of medical equipment.  Our fees are paid directly by our customers rather than by direct reimbursement from third-party payors, such as private insurers, Medicare or Medicaid. 

We report our financial results in three segments. Our reporting segments consist of MES, CES and SS. We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based on gross margin. The accounting policies of the individual reportable segments are the same as those of the entire company. 

Medical Equipment Solutions 

Our MES segment accounted for $73.5 and $69.0 million, or approximately 62.3% and 62.1% of our revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $228.6 and $214.2 million, or approximately 63.9% and 63.6% of our revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016,  the MES segment owned or managed approximately 400,000 units of medical equipment ranging across many clinical categories, manufacturers and models.  These solutions are provided primarily to hospitals and other acute care providers for use through their facilities, including the emergency room, operating room, critical care, intensive care, rehabilitation and general patient care areas. 

Our MES segment started more than 75 years ago as our leading medical equipment peak needs usage business and has transformed into providing comprehensive outsourced and on-site solutions that manage all aspects of medical equipment in a health care facility. We currently provide MES solutions to more than 7,000 acute care hospitals and alternate site providers in the United States, including some of the nation s premier health care institutions. We expect much of our future growth in this segment to be driven by our customers outsourcing more of their medical equipment needs and taking full advantage of our diversified product offering, clinical education and support, customized agreements and 360 On-site Managed Solutions. 

28 

Table of Contents  

We have four primary solutions in our MES segment: 

Supplemental and Peak Needs Usage Solutions;     

Customized Equipment Agreements Solutions;     

Specialty Medical Equipment Sales, Distribution and Disposal Solutions.     

Clinical Engineering Solutions 

Our CES segment accounted for $26.9 and $25.4 million, or approximately 22.8% and 22.9% of our revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $78.0 and $74.6 million, or approximately 21.8% and 22.1% of our revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We offer a broad range of inspection, preventive maintenance, repair, logistic and consulting services through our team of over 390 technicians and professionals located throughout the United States in our nationwide network of service centers.  We managed over 300,000 units of customer owned equipment as of September 30, 2016.  In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we serviced approximately 400,000 units that we own or directly manage in our MES segment. 

Our CES segment leverages our over 75 years of experience and our extensive equipment database in repairing and maintaining a broad range of health care technologies. Historically, we have been our own largest customer for CES services in order to repair and maintain approximately 400,000 units that we own or directly manage. However, we believe our CES segment has significant future growth potential by offering non-capital based comprehensive solutions as a stand-alone or complementary alternative for customers that own medical equipment but lack the infrastructure, expertise, or scale to perform routine maintenance, repair, record keeping, and lifecycle analysis and planning functions.  We also believe hospital and other facility-based clients will face increasing challenges in managing sophisticated medical equipment that requires connectivity and interoperability with information technology systems, compliance with the 10  th   revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), regulatory requirements, integration with electronic medical records (EMR), maintenance and management of software databases and management of other medical equipment patient information and safety features. 

We have three primary solutions in our CES segment: 

Supplemental Maintenance and Repair Solutions;     

Manufacturer Solutions.     

Surgical Services 

Our SS segment accounted for $17.6 and $16.7 million, or approximately 14.9% and 15.0% of our revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,  respectively and $51.1 and $48.2 million, or approximately 14.3% and 14.3% of our revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we owned or managed over 7,000 units of mobile surgical equipment in our SS segment, primarily used in the practice of general surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, urology, obstetrics, gynecology, podiatry, dermatology and plastic/cosmetics. 

SS provides high end, state-of-the-art surgical equipment and associated products along with trained and certified Surgical Equipment Technologists ( technologists ) to assist in the procedural operation of the equipment. We provide these services to over 1,000 acute care hospitals and surgery centers through our nationwide network of 83 district service centers and an additional five stand-alone SS service centers. Our technologists work in the operating room ( O.R. ) and support physicians and O.R. personnel. The services are offered on a per-procedure basis. Our technologists deliver, set up, and create a safe environment for hospital and clinical personnel operating the equipment and provide all necessary disposable materials needed. Our technologists work closely with our customers to confirm that all certifications and credentials meet requirements to provide on-site services. Our technologists also assist customers in the operation of facility-owned assets and supplement the training and staffing of their personnel.  As of September 30, 2016, SS provided solutions in 42 states.

Table of Contents  

Consolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

Total Revenue 

Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $117.9 million, compared to $111.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $6.8 million or 6.2%.  The net increase was primarily due to additional revenue within our MES segment related to growth in our 360 Solutions of $3.4 million,  growth in our CES segment of $1.5 million related to growth in providing existing and new customers with services on their equipment and growth in our SS segment of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by customer losses in the MES segment. 

Cost of Revenue 

Total cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $79.4 million compared to $75.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.8 million or 5.1%. The increase was primarily in our MES segment due to increases in 360 solutions cost of $1.6 million and other rental costs of $1.3 million and the increase in CES 360 solutions cost of $1.2 million. The increase was partially offset with the decrease in medical equipment depreciation of $1.0 million. 

Gross Margin 

Total gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $38.5 million, or 32.7% of total revenues, compared to $35.5 million, or 32.0% of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.0 million or 8.4%.  The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue for the quarter was primarily impacted by growth in our 360 solutions and lower depreciation expense. 

Medical Equipment Solutions 

(in thousands) 

Total revenue in the MES segment increased $4.5 million, or 6.5%, to $73.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the growth in our 360 solutions from both new programs and expansion of existing programs of $3.4 million and growth in our sales and remarketing revenue of $0.7 million. The increases were partially offset by the loss of certain customers. Many of our 360 solution customers utilize more than one of our equipment management program offerings in areas such as infusion, patient handling and negative pressure wound therapy. As of September 30, 2016,  we had 238 such active programs, up from 230 as of December 31, 2015. 

Total cost of revenue in the segment increased $3.0 million, or 10.0%, to $33.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  This increase was due to the increases in costs to support growth in our 360 solutions of $1.6 million largely due to the increase in employee related cost and an increase in rental costs of $1.3 million largerly due to the higher technician costs and repair parts expense.   

Medical equipment depreciation decreased $1.0 million, or 6.9%, to $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in medical equipment depreciation was primarily due to reduced depreciation resulting from disposals of certain medical equipment.

Table of Contents  

Gross margin percentage for the MES segment increased from 34.5% in the third quarter of 2015 to 35.8% in the same period of 2016. Gross margin rate was impacted by lower depreciation and growth in our 360 solutions.

Total revenue in the CES segment increased $1.5 million, or 6.0%, to $26.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth in our managed 360 solutions.  As of September 30, 2016, we had 360 solutions implemented in 203 programs in our CES segment, up from 180 programs as of December 31, 2015. 

Total cost of revenue in the segment increased $1.2 million, or 6.1%, to $21.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in repair parts and vendor expenses to support the revenue growth and mix shifts in type of service provided to customers. 

Gross margin percentage for the CES segment was consistent at 21.0% in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015.

Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.9 million, or 6.1%, to $28.8 million for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower travel, payroll, depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 24.4% and 27.6% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased $0.2 million to $13.1 million for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes were an expense of $0.3 and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily related to state minimum fees. The expected tax benefit from operating loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was offset by the recording of additional valuation allowance. In future reporting periods, we will continue to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realizable. 

Consolidated Net Loss 

Consolidated net loss decreased $4.9 million to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  Net loss was impacted by the growth in revenue as well as the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2016. 

Consolidated Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Total Revenue 

Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $357.7 million, compared to $336.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $20.8 million or 6.2%.  The net increase was primarily due to additional revenue within our MES segment related to growth in our 360 solutions of $9.8 million and sales and remarketing revenue of $4.1 million, growth in our CES segment of $3.4 million related to growth in providing existing and new customers with services on their equipment and growth in our SS segment of $2.9 million. These increases were partially offset by customer losses in our MES segment. 

Cost of Revenue 

Total cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $240.6 million compared to $227.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $12.9 million or 5.6%. The increase was primarily in our MES segment due to the increases in 360 solutions cost of $5.3 million, other rental costs of $3.6 million and cost of equipment sales of $3.2 million, an increase in our CES 360 solutions cost of $2.6 million corresponding with the 360 solutions revenue growth and an increase in our SS cost of $1.5 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in medical equipment depreciation of $3.4 million.

Gross Margin 

Total gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $117.1 million, or 32.7% of total revenues, compared to $109.2 million, or 32.5% of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7.9 million or 7.3%.  The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue was primarily impacted by lower depreciation expense and growth in our 360 solutions. 

Medical Equipment Solutions 

(in thousands) 

Total revenue in the MES segment increased $14.5 million, or 6.8%, to $228.6 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the growth in our 360 solutions from both new programs and expansion of existing programs of $9.8 million and growth in sales and remarketing of $4.1 million.  Many of our 360 Solution customers utilize more than one of our equipment management program offerings in areas such as infusion, patient handling and negative pressure wound therapy. As of September 30, 2016, we had 238 such active programs, up from 230 as of December 31, 2015. 

Total cost of revenue in the segment increased $12.2 million, or 13.2%, to $104.6 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  This increase was due to  an increase in costs to support growth in our 360 solutions of $5.3 million largely due to increases in employee related expense of $3.1 million and repair parts of $0.8 million, an increase in other supplemental rental costs of $3.6 million largely due to higher repair parts expense and an increase in cost of equipment sales of $3.3 million.   

Medical equipment depreciation decreased $3.3 million, or 7.3%, to $42.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in medical equipment depreciation was primarily due to reduced depreciation resulting from disposals of certain medical equipment.  

Gross margin percentage for the MES segment increased from 35.5% in the first nine months of 2015 to 35.7% in the same period of 2016. Gross margin rate was impacted by sales mix and lower depreciation.

Total cost of revenue in the segment increased $2.6 million, or 4.4%, to $61.9 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in vendor expenses and employee related costs to support the revenue growth and mix shifts in type of service provided to customers. 

Gross margin percentage for the CES segment increased from 20.4% in the first nine months of 2015 to 20.5% in the same period of 2016.  Gross margin percentage will fluctuate based on the variability of third-party vendor expenses in our 360 solutions and supplemental service programs, as well as fluctuation of services being performed for manufacturer services. 

Surgical Services 

(in thousands) 

Total revenue in the SS segment increased $2.9 million, or 6.1%, to $51.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was driven primarily by organic growth in our surgical services business and to a lesser extent from an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2015. 

Total cost of revenue in the segment increased $1.5 million, or 5.8%, to $27.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the increases in employee related costs to support growth in our surgical services business and cost of disposables. 

Medical equipment depreciation decreased $0.1 million, or 2.4%, to $4.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. 

Gross margin percentage for the SS segment increased from 37.3% in the first nine months of 2015 to 38.2% in the same period of 2016. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by both positive operating leverage from volume growth and some shift to higher margin modalities.

Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $3.0 million, or 3.2%, to $88.9 million for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower consulting costs. 

Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 24.8% and 27.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Table of Contents  

Gain on Settlement 

Gain on settlement of $2.8 and $5.7 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively was related to settlements with a supplier and former supplier. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased $0.6 million to $39.2 million for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes were an expense of $0.7 and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily related to state minimum fees. The expected tax benefit from operating loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was offset by the recording of additional valuation allowance. In future reporting periods, we will continue to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realizable. 

Consolidated Net Loss 

Consolidated net loss decreased $8.4 million to $8.9 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  Net loss was impacted by the growth in revenue as well as the decreases in medical equipment depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

EBITDA 

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ) was $94.1 and $91.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was higher primarily due to lower medical equipment depreciation and selling, general and administration expenses. 

In addition to using EBITDA internally as a measure of operational performance, we disclose it externally to assist analysts, investors and lenders in their comparisons of operational performance, valuation and debt capacity across companies with differing capital, tax and legal structures. EBITDA, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities or as a measure of liquidity.  Since EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA does not represent an amount of funds that is available for management s discretionary use. A reconciliation of net loss attributable to UHS to EBITDA is included below:

SEASONALITY 

Quarterly operating results are typically affected by seasonal factors.  Historically, our first and fourth quarters are the strongest, reflecting increased customer utilization during the fall and winter months. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Original Notes and Add-on Notes   7.625%.   On August 7, 2012, we issued $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  Original Notes ) under an indenture dated as of August 7, 2012 (the  2012 Indenture ).  On February 12, 2013, we issued $220.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  Add-on Notes , and along with the Original Notes, the  2012 Notes ) as  additional notes  pursuant to the 2012 Indenture. The 2012 Notes mature on August 15, 2020. 

The 2012 Indenture provides that the 2012 Notes are our second lien senior secured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by our existing and certain of our future 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. 

Our principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, which provides for loans in an amount of up to $235.0 million, subject to our borrowing base. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt, for details related to our senior secured credit facility. It is anticipated that our principal uses of liquidity will be to fund capital expenditures related to purchases of medical equipment, provide working capital, meet debt service requirements and finance our strategic plans. 

We require substantial cash to operate our health care technology solutions and service our debt.  Our health care technology solutions require us to invest a significant amount of cash in medical equipment purchases.  To the extent that such expenditures cannot be funded from our operating cash flow, borrowing under our senior secured credit facility or other financing sources, we may not be able to conduct our business or grow as currently planned. 

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in order to service our debt, we will be forced to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  If we are unable to repay our debt at maturity, we may have to obtain alternative financing, which may not be available to us.

Table of Contents  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 and $43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily from higher incentive payments in 2016, the timing of accounts receivable colletions from specific customers and working capital increases primarily related to timing. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $37.0 and $33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher medical equipment purchases and lower proceeds from sale of medical equipment in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $14.5 and $(9.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 

Based on the level of operating performance expected in 2016, we believe our cash from operations and additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, exclusive of any borrowings that we may make to finance potential acquisitions.  However, if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $111.7 million of availability under the senior secured credit facility based on a borrowing base of $167.1 million less borrowings of $50.9 million and after giving effect to $4.5 million used for letters of credit.  As of September 30, 2015, we had $129.7 million of availability under the senior secured credit facility based on a borrowing base of $168.7 million less borrowings of $35.1 million and after giving effect to $3.9 million used for letters of credit. 

Our levels of borrowing are further restricted by the financial covenants set forth in our senior secured credit facility agreement and the 2012 Indenture governing our 2012 Notes, as described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt. 

The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented.

For further information on risks applicable to us, please see the disclosure regarding the risk factors as set forth in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3.  Quantitative   and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risk arising from adverse changes in interest rates, fuel costs and pension valuation.  We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative purposes. 

Interest Rates 

We use both fixed and variable rate debt as sources of financing.  At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $721.6 million of total debt outstanding of which $50.9 million was bearing interest at variable rates. Based on variable debt levels at September 30, 2016, a 1.0 percentage point change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in annual interest expense fluctuating by approximately $0.5 million. 

Fuel Costs 

We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in the price of gasoline used to fuel our fleet of delivery and sales vehicles.  A hypothetical 10% increase in the first nine months of 2016 average price of unleaded gasoline, assuming gasoline usage levels for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, would lead to an annual increase in fuel costs of approximately $0.3 million. 

Pension 

Our pension plan assets, which were approximately $19.5 million at December 31, 2015, are subject to volatility that can be caused by fluctuations in general economic conditions. Continued market volatility and disruption could cause further declines in asset values, and if this occurs, we may need to make additional pension plan contributions and our pension expense in future years may increase. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2015 would lead to a decrease in the funded status of the plan of approximately $2.0 million. 

Other Market Risk 

As of September 30, 2016, we have no other material exposure to market risk.

Item 4.  Controls and   Procedures 

(a) 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures     

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

(b) 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting     

There were no changes that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER   INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal   Proceedings 

The Company, in the ordinary course of business, could be subject to liability claims related to employees and the equipment that it rents and services. Asserted claims are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. While the ultimate resolution of these actions may have an impact on the Company s financial results for a particular reporting period, management believes that any such resolution would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company and the chance of a negative outcome on outstanding litigation is considered remote. See the additional information in Item 1 of Part I, Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies. 

Item 1A.  Ris  k Factors 

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties.  Any of the risks discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors set forth in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

(iii.)  conviction or confession of an act or acts on Executive s part constituting a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or any misdemeanor which materially impairs such Executive s ability to perform the Duties; 

(iv.)  any willful act or omission on Executive s part which is materially injurious to the financial condition or business reputation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control will not include the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the

Company to a private equity firm who invests in companies (a  Private Equity Firm ), or a company owned or controlled by a Private Equity Firm.

I.   Involuntary Termination  of an Executive occurs when the Executive has a Termination of Employment for reasons other than Cause that is  involuntary  within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(n)(1) of the Treasury Regulations, or solely with respect to an Executive   President or Executive   SVP, such Executive   President or Executive   SVP has a Termination of Employment for Good Reason.  With respect to an Executive   President or Executive   SVP, Termination of Employment which occurs due to the Executive   President s or Executive   SVP s death or Disability shall be considered an Involuntary Termination.  With respect to an Executive   VP, Termination of Employment which occurs due to (i) the Executive   VP s death or Disability or (ii) the Executive   VP s termination for Good Reason shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination.  For purposes hereof,  Disability  means the Executive s inability to perform the essential functions of his or her position for a period of at least six months due to illness or accident after being provided with any reasonable accommodation or leave the Company may be obligated by law to provide. 

J.   Good Reason  means that, other than for Cause, any of the events set forth in paragraphs (i)-(iii) below has occurred; within 30 days of such event, the Executive notifies the Company in writing of such event, and the Company fails

to cure the event within 60 days of receiving such notice; and the Executive Terminates Employment no later than 90 days after providing such notice. 

(i.)  The Company has demoted Executive, as evidenced by a material reduction or reassignment of Executive duties (per Executive job description), provided, however, that any change in Executive s position constituting a lateral move or promotion will not be deemed to give rise to Good Reason unless Executive is required to relocate pursuant to Section J(iii) below; 

(ii.)  The Executive s base salary has been materially reduced other than in connection with an across-the-board reduction (of approximately the same percentage) in executive compensation to employees imposed by the board of directors of the Company in response to negative financial results or other adverse circumstances affecting the Company; or 

(iii.)  The Company has required Executive to relocate in excess of 50 miles from the location where the Executive is currently employed. 

K.   Salary  means all income earned as an employee of the Company and reportable in box 5 of Form W-2 (or the corresponding box of any subsequent form W-2), as adjusted in accordance with the following rules.  Salary does not include any bonus or incentive plan payments, payments made to compensate employees for benefits lost under qualified benefit plans due to the application of compensation limits as determined by the Plan Administrator, payments classified by the Plan Administrator as reimbursed business expenses, or any benefits payable under this Plan.  The Plan Administrator, in its absolute discretion, may include or exclude additional items in determining Salary for participants, and may reduce the amount of Salary considered for purposes of determining benefits under this Plan if necessary to retain this Plan s eligibility for the severance pay plan exception to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 

L.   Severance Period  means the period from the Date of Termination through the date which is 12 months from the Date of Termination. 

M.   Termination of Employment  or  Terminate Employment  means the Executive s Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. 

III.    Eligibility  .  Participation in this Plan is limited to Executives.  Executives who receive severance under this Plan will not be eligible to receive severance benefits under any other plan or agreement of the Company.  

IV.    Severance Benefits. 

3 

A.  Executives who have an Involuntary Termination, and who sign the general release and other agreement described below in this Section IV within 45 days of such Involuntary Termination and who do not rescind the general release within the period required by law, are entitled to the severance benefits specified below in this Section IV.   

B.  Upon qualifying for severance pay subject to Section V, Executives will be paid the following amounts in the following manner: 

Executive   President 

(i) 

The Executive   President will continue to be paid his or her Salary through the Severance Period, in the manner and at the times paid during such Executive   President s employment with the Company; provided, however, that the first such payment will be made as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the release described in Section V.  All such payments shall be subject to any required withholding and will be paid regardless of any other employment the Executive   President may accept.     

(ii.)  The Executive   President may elect at his or her expense to continue group health and dental benefits through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) for a period of up to 18 months, to the extent he or she is eligible.  The Executive   President will receive a lump payment of $11,350, which is equivalent to the amount of the portion of the Executive   President s COBRA premiums as the Company paid during the Executive   President s employment. 

(iii.)  The Company will pay the Executive   President a prorated bonus for the then-current fiscal year, calculated at the Executive   President s individual bonus target and prorated based upon the number of days the Executive   President was actually employed during that year.  If such bonus would cause the total amount of severance payments under this Plan to exceed the lesser of (a) twice the participant s annual rate of pay during the year immediately preceding his or her termination; or (b) twice the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (e.g. 2 X $260,000, or $530,000 for 2015), the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, reduce such bonus to avoid the application of Section 409A.  Such bonus will be payable in a single lump sum payment on the 61  st   day following the Date of Termination. 

(iv.)  If the Executive   President s Involuntary Termination occurs during the Change of Control Period, the Company will pay the Executive   President an additional amount equal to 100% of such Executive   President s target bonus for the then-current fiscal year.  Such amount will be paid in the manner and at the times paid during such Executive   President s employment with the Company; provided, however, that the first such   

4 

payment will be made as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the release described in Section V.  All such payments shall be subject to any required withholding. 

(v.)  The Executive   President will receive outplacement assistance services as determined by the Company. 

Executive   SVP 

(vi) 

The Executive   SVP will continue to be paid his or her Salary through the Severance Period, in the manner and at the times paid during such Executive   SVP s employment with the Company; provided, however, that the first such payment will be made as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the release described in Section V.  All such payments shall be subject to any required withholding and will be paid regardless of any other employment the Executive   SVP may accept.     

(vii.)  The Executive   SVP may elect at his or her expense to continue group health and dental benefits through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) for a period of up to 18 months, to the extent he or she is eligible.  The Executive   SVP will receive a lump payment of $11,350, which is equivalent to the amount of the portion of the Executive   SVP s COBRA premiums as the Company paid during the Executive   SVP s employment. 

(viii.)  The Company will pay the Executive   SVP a prorated bonus for the then-current fiscal year, calculated at the Executive   SVP s individual bonus target and prorated based upon the number of days the Executive   SVP was actually employed during that year.  If such bonus would cause the total amount of severance payments under this Plan to exceed the lesser of (a) twice the participant s annual rate of pay during the year immediately preceding his or her termination; or (b) twice the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (e.g. 2 X $260,000, or $530,000 for 2015), the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, reduce such bonus to avoid the application of Section 409A.  Such bonus will be payable in a single lump sum payment on the 61  st   day following the Date of Termination. 

(ix.)  The Executive   SVP will receive outplacement assistance services as determined by the Company. 

Executive   VP 

(x) 

The Executive   VP will continue to be paid his or her Salary through the Severance Period, in the manner and at the times paid during such Executive   VP s employment with the Company; provided, however, that      

5 

the first such payment will be made as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the release described in Section V.  All such payments shall be subject to any required withholding.     

(xi.)  If the Executive   VP is eligible for and elects COBRA continuation for medical and/or dental coverage under any Company-sponsored medical and/or dental plans, the Executive   VP shall receive payment of the same portion of the Executive   VP s COBRA premiums as the Company paid during the Executive   VP s employment for a period of up to twelve (12) months, provided the Executive   VP timely elects COBRA coverage and remains otherwise eligible to receive COBRA benefits. 

(xii.)  The Executive   VP will receive severance pay as set forth in paragraph (i) above for the first 6 months after the Date of Termination regardless of any other employment the Executive   VP may accept.  If the Executive   VP finds other employment during the next 6 months after the Date of Termination, the amount of severance payments in accordance with B(x) above will be reduced by the value of the compensation the Executive   VP receives in his or her new employment from the date which is six months and one day after the Date of Termination through the date which is 12 months after the Date of Termination.  The amounts payable in accordance with B(xi) will be similarly discontinued if medical and dental benefits are secured through the new employer.  The Executive   VP shall be required to provide the Company with satisfactory evidence of the amount of compensation in his or her new employment. 

(xiii.)  If the Executive   VP s Involuntary Termination occurs either (1) on or after October 1  st   of the then-current fiscal year or (2) during the Change of Control Period, the Company will provide the Executive   VP a prorated portion of the bonus earned for the then-current fiscal year, based upon the number of days the Executive   VP was employed during that year.  If such bonus would cause the total amount of severance payments under this Plan to exceed the lesser of (a) twice the participant s annual rate of pay during the year immediately preceding his or her termination; or (b) twice the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (e.g. 2 X $260,000, or $530,000 for 2015), the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, reduce such bonus to avoid the application of Section 409A.  Such bonus will be payable at the time annual bonuses are paid to the executives who remain employed by the Company.  Such bonus shall not in any case be paid later than the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Involuntary Termination of such Executive   VP occurred. 

(xiv.)  The Executive   VP will receive outplacement assistance services as determined by the Company. 

6 

V.    General Release and Other Agreements. 

Executive will not be entitled to receive any of the severance pay described above until such time as Executive signs (A) an effective general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates in the form and manner prescribed by the Company and (B) an agreement further providing (i) Executive s agreement not to disclose or use confidential information of the Company, (ii) Executive s agreement during the Severance Period not to compete with the Company in the medical equipment rental business, (iii) Executive s agreement during the Severance Period not to solicit for employment or hire any person who was an employee of the Company at any time within the one year period before the Executive s Date of Termination, and (iv) Executive s agreement during the Severance Period not to induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other business relation of the Company to cease doing business with the Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and the Company or any Subsidiary.  A failure to execute such a general release and other agreements within 45 days of Executive s Date of Termination or a subsequent rescission of such general release within the time allowed will result in the loss of any right to receive payments or benefits under this Plan. 

VI.    Termination of Severance Benefits. 

In addition to any other remedies the Company may have for breach of any of the terms of the General Release and other Agreements, upon any such breach, the Company will immediately cease payment of the severance benefits provided for under the Plan and the Executive will be required to return any severance benefit that he or she has received under the Plan. 

VII.    Section 409A.   

Although the Company does not guarantee to the Executive any particular tax treatment relating to the payments under the Plan, it is intended that such payments be exempt from, or comply with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and the Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. 

(a)  A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of the Plan providing for the payment of amounts subject to Section 409A of the Code upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  Separation from Service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of the Plan references to a  resignation,   termination,   termination of employment  or the like terms shall mean  Separation from Service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. 

7 

(b)  The right to each severance pay installment described in Section IV.B and paid under the Plan will at all times be treated as the  right to a series of separate payments  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) and any subsequent authority.  

(c)  If any payment of money or provision of any benefit provided pursuant to the Plan constitutes  nonqualified deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A of the Code, and could potentially be made or provided in two different calendar years based on when the Executive signs and delivers the release, such payment or benefit will be made or provided to the Executive no earlier than the first business day of the second of such calendar years. 

VIII.    Amendment and Modification of Plan.    This Plan may be modified, amended or terminated at any time by the CEO and the Board of Directors of the Company provided that during the Change of Control Period no such modification, amendment or termination of this Plan may (i) reduce the ability of any participant to receive severance benefits under this Plan, (ii) reduce the benefits that any participant is eligible to receive or (iii) otherwise adversely impact any participant hereunder. 

IX.    Plan Administration  .  The Company is the Plan Administrator, and may delegate to an employee the responsibility of day to day administration of the Plan.  The Plan Administrator shall have authority, discretion, responsibility and control over the administration of the Plan.  This grant of power shall be full, final, complete, conclusive, and exclusive.  It shall be binding as to all parties, and will be above and beyond the initial ability to unilaterally determine the meaning of a term or deny benefits.  The power shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 

(1) 

Construe and interpret the provisions and language of the Plan, including doubtful or disputed terms;     

(2) 

Determine all questions of eligibility for Plan participation;     

(3) 

Determine the approval or denial of all benefits, payments and claims under the Plan, including the appeal of all claim decisions;     

(4) 

Determine the amount of any benefits payable under the Plan, and authorize and direct the payment of such benefits;     

(5) 

Make and apply such rules, regulations, and policies, and prescribe the use of such forms as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan, such rules, regulations and policies to apply uniformly to all employees in similar circumstances;     

8 

(6) 

Provide Executives, government agencies and other appropriate parties with such returns, reports, schedules and individual statements as are required by law within the time prescribed by law;     

(7) 

Appoint or employ individuals to assist in the administration of the Plan and other agents deemed advisable; and     

(8) 

Do such other acts reasonably required to administer the Plan in accordance with its provisions or as may be provided for or required by law.      

Any interpretation, determination, rule or regulation issued by the Plan Administrator shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.  In any review of such an interpretation, determination, rule or regulation, the Plan Administrator s decision shall be given deference and shall be set aside by a reviewing tribunal only in the event the Plan Administrator acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to accept service of process on behalf of the Program. 

X.    No Employment Rights.    Neither this Plan nor the benefits hereunder shall be a term of the employment of any employee, and the Company shall not be obligated in any way to continue the Plan.  The terms of this Plan shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employment of the Company. 

XI.    Successors.    This Plan shall be binding upon any successor of the Company, including, without limitation, any purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. 

XII.    Claims Procedures. 

CLAIM PROCEDURES 

A.  Initial Claim.    A participant who believes he or she is entitled to a larger benefit than is provided, or a benefit that was denied, may file a written claim with the Plan Administrator.  The written claim must provide an explanation of the claim s nature;     the facts supporting the claim;     the amount of the claim; and     the participant s name and mailing address. 

If a claim is denied in whole or in part, the participant will be notified in writing      within 90 days of the receipt of the claim.  If special circumstances require more time for this process, the participant will be notified within 90 days of the special circumstances requiring an extension, and the date (no more than 180 days after receipt of the claim) by which a decision will be made. 

A written claim denial notice will include the specific reason(s) for the denial; references to the Plan provision(s) on which the denial is based; a description of any   

9 

additional material or information that is necessary to perfect the claim (and an explanation of why such information or material is necessary); and the procedures for appealing the decision, including a statement regarding your right to bring a civil court action under the Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA) after exhaustion of the Plan s claim procedures. 

A participant or his or her authorized representative may review all documents related to any denial of benefits. 

B.  Appeal 

A participant who disagrees with the Plan Administrator s decision has 60 days from the receipt of the original denial to request an appeal. This request for an appeal should be in writing.  The participant or his or her authorized representative will be given the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to his or her claim for benefits. The participant will also be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim for benefits. 

The appeal will be reviewed and written notification of a decision provided within 60 days. If special circumstances require more time for this process, the participant will be notified in writing of the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which a decision will be made. All determinations of appeals made are final and binding. In the event of an adverse determination of an appeal, the participant is entitled to bring suit in federal court under section 502(a) of ERISA. 

C.  Deadline to Commence Legal Action 

A participant who files his or her claim within the required time, completes the entire claim procedures, and is denied the claim on review, may sue over such claim (unless he or she has executed a release on such claim).  Such a lawsuit must commence within six (6) months after the claims process is completed and may not, under any circumstances, be brought more than 30 months after the participant knew or should have known of facts behind the claim. 

D.  Venue 

All litigation in any way related to the Plan (including but not limited to any and all claims brought under ERISA, such as claims for benefits and claims for breach of fiduciary duty) must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, in Minneapolis
