PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
     
   Item 1 - Consolidated Financial Statements   
   
     The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' deficit in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 
   
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the audited balance sheet as of June 30, 2016, our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, and our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

  SANGUI BIOTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.  
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 
 (Unaudited) 
  NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should, therefore, be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Nature of Business  
   
 Sangui Biotech International, Inc., incorporated in Colorado in 1995, and its subsidiary, Sangui BioTech GmbH (Sangui GmbH). Sangui GmbH, which is headquartered in Witten, Germany, is engaged in the development of artificial oxygen carriers (external applications of hemoglobin, blood substitutes and blood additives) as well as in the development, marketing and sales of cosmetics and wound management products. 
   
  Consolidation  
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sangui BioTech International, Inc. and its ninety percent owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Foreign Currency Translation  
   
 Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from such translation are excluded from net loss but are included in comprehensive income (loss) and accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period. 
   
 Exchanges rates used for the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)  for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were calculated as follows: 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
  Risk and Uncertainties  
   
 The Company's line of future pharmaceutical products (artificial oxygen carriers or blood substitute and additives) and medical products (wound dressings and other wound management products) being developed by Sangui GmbH, are deemed as medical devices or biologics, and as such are governed by the Federal Food and Drug and Cosmetics Act and by the regulations of state agencies and various foreign government agencies. The pharmaceutical, under development in Germany, will be subject to more stringent regulatory requirements, because they are in vivo products for humans. The Company and its subsidiaries have no experience in obtaining regulatory clearance on these types of products. Therefore, the Company will be subject to the risks of delays in obtaining or failing to obtain regulatory clearance. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $36,737,218 as of September 30, 2016. The Company incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $67,900 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and used cash in operating activities of $79,233 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to continue to incur significant capital expenses in pursuing its business plan to market its products and expand its product line, while obtaining additional financing through stock offerings or other feasible financing alternatives. In order for the Company to continue its operations at its existing levels, the Company will require significant additional funds over the next twelve months. Therefore, the Company is dependent on funds raised through equity or debt offerings. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. If these funds are not available the Company may not be able to execute its business plan or take advantage of business opportunities. The ability of the Company to obtain such additional financing and to achieve its operating goals is uncertain. In the event that the Company does not obtain additional capital, is not able to collect its outstanding receivables or is not able to increase cash flow through the increase of sales, there is a substantial doubt of its being able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts in Germany. Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits for which the Company has no requirements for compensating balances. The Company has not experienced any losses in its uninsured bank accounts. At September 30, the Company had no cash equivalents. 
   
  Research and Development  
   
 Research and development costs are charged to operations as they are incurred. Legal fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining and protecting patents are expensed as incurred.

   Revenue Recognition  
   
 Product sales revenue is recognized when the sales amount is determined, shipment of goods to the customer has occurred and collection is reasonably assured. Product is shipped FOB origination.  Product royalty revenue is recognized when the licensee has reported the product sales to the Company. Product royalty revenue is calculated based upon the contractual percentage of reported sales.  
   
  Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  
   
 Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period of computation. Diluted earnings (loss) per share give effect to all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period of compensation. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no potentially dilutive securities that would affect the loss per share if they were to be dilutive. 
   
  Comprehensive Income (Loss)  
   
 Total comprehensive income (loss) represents the net change in stockholders' equity during a period from sources other than transactions with stockholders and as such, includes net earnings (loss). For the Company, the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are the changes in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and are recorded as components of stockholders' equity. 
   
  NOTE 3 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
   
  Litigation  
   
 The Company may, from time to time, be involved in various legal disputes resulting from the ordinary course of operating its business. Management is currently not able to predict the outcome of any such cases. However, management believes that the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such actions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 
   
  Indemnities and Guarantees  
   
 During the normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include certain agreements with the Company's officers, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such person for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The duration of these indemnities and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, is indefinite. The majority of these indemnities and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
   
  NOTE 4     NOTE PAYABLE, RELATED PARTIES  
   
 On March 6, 2015, the Company entered into a note payable with a family member of a Company Director for 100,000 euros, or $108,500.  On May 31, 2016 the note payable and accrued interest were transferred to the Company Director. The note payable accrues interest at 5 percent per annum, is due on March 31, 2017 and is unsecured. The balance of this note is $110,940, (translated into US dollars as of September 30, 2016).

Item 2 - Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations   
   
  Forward-looking Statements  
   
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.  Some of the information in this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to anticipated operating results, margins, growth, financial resources, capital requirements, adequacy of the Company's financial resources, trends in spending on research and development, the development of new markets, the development, regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution, and commercial acceptance of new products, and future product development efforts.  Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may affect our business and prospects, including but not limited to, the Company's expected need for additional funding and the uncertainty of receiving the additional funding, changes in economic and market conditions, acceptance of our products by the health care and reimbursement communities, new development of competitive products and treatments, administrative and regulatory approval and related considerations, health care legislation and regulation, and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
  GENERAL  
 Our mission is the development of novel and proprietary pharmaceutical, medical and cosmetic products. We develop our products through our German subsidiary, Sangui GmbH. Currently, we are seeking to market and sell our products through partnerships with industry partners worldwide. 
 Our focus has been the development of oxygen carriers capable of providing oxygen transport in humans in the event of acute and/or chronic lack of oxygen due to arterial occlusion, anemia or blood loss whether due to surgery, trauma, or other causes, as well as in the case of chronic wounds.  We have thus far focused our development and commercialization efforts on such artificial oxygen carriers by reproducing and synthesizing polymers out of native hemoglobin of defined molecular sizes.  In addition, we have developed external applications of oxygen transporters in the medical and cosmetic fields in the form of sprays for the healing of chronic wounds and of gels and emulsions for the regeneration of the skin. A wound dressing that shows outstanding properties in the support of wound healing, is distributed by SastoMed GmbH, a former joint venture company in which we held a share of 25%, as global licensee under the Granulox brand name. Effective End of second quarter of our fiscal year 2016 we sold this stake to SanderStrohmann GmbH, the co-shareholder. 
 SanguiBioTech GmbH holds distribution rights for our Chitoskin wound pads for the European Union and various other countries. A European patent has been granted for the production and use of improved Chitoskin wound pads. 
 Our current key business focuses are: (a) selling our existing cosmetics and wound management products by way of licensing through distribution partners, or by way of direct sale, to end users; (b) identifying additional industrial and distribution partners for our patents, production techniques, and products; and, (c) obtaining the additional certifications on our products in development. 
   
  Artificial Oxygen Carriers  
 SanguiBioTech GmbH develops several products based on polymers of purified natural porcine hemoglobin with oxygen carrying abilities that are similar to native hemoglobin.  These are (1) oxygen carrying blood additives and (2) oxygen carrying blood volume substitutes. 
 During the first quarter of our 2013 financial year the European Patent Office granted a patent based on Sangui   s application (01 945 245)    Mammalian hemoglobin compatible with blood plasma, cross-linked and conjugated with polyalkylene oxides as artificial medical oxygen carriers, production and use thereof   . 
 During the third quarter of our 2013 financial year the company had a feasibility study prepared by external experts inquiring into market potentials and further preclinical and clinical development requirements. The study came to the conclusion that an approval of Sangui's hemoglobin hyperpolymers as a blood additive appears possible, expedient and promising.  

8 

During the fourth quarter of our 2014 financial year the company filed a patent application aimed at significantly expanding the protection of our hemoglobin formulations. It will encompass a greater array of ischemic conditions of the human body, for instance in the case of severe dysfunctions of the lung. 
 During the first quarter of our 2015 financial year, we began together with Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS) and TransMIT Gesellschaft f r Technologietransfer mbH (TransMIT) to investigate therapeutic approaches to treating septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The approach adopted here by Sangui, ECCPS and TransMIT presupposes that self-perpetuating septic shock, that has so far been highly resistant to treatment, can be interrupted by Sangui's artificial haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, which would ultimately lower mortality rates. The preclinical trials commenced at ECCPS investigate the effect of various haemoglobin preparations on the oxygen supply of a number of organs in septic shock models and ARDS. 
 Also during the first quarter we were notified that the period for objection against European Patent EP 2550973,Wound Spray   ) elapsed without any objection being raised. The patent, therefore, has become effective and legally binding. 
 During the second quarter of our 2015 financial year the first phase of preclinical trials was concluded successfully. It could be demonstrated that applying an oxygen-carrying liquid (the hemoglobin hyperpolymer formulation SBT102) in the abdomen did significantly improve the oxygen supply to the intestines. The restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and ultimately on patient survival. 
 During the third quarter of our 2015 financial year the preclinical trials were concluded successfully, the final results did fully confirm the interim results obtained in the second quarter. 
 According to regulatory requirements, all drugs must complete preclinical and clinical trials before approval (e.g. Federal Drug Administration approval) and market launch. The Company   s management believes that the European and FDA approval process will take at a minimum several years to complete. 
   
 Our most promising potential product in the area of artificial oxygen carriers, the blood additive is still in an early development stage. In the pursuit of these projects we will need to obtain substantial additional capital to continue their development. 
   
 The blood additives project was halted in the second quarter of our financial year 2016 due to the lack of financing the further authorization. 

9 

Nano Formulations for the Regeneration of the Skin  
   
 Healthy skin is supplied with oxygen both from the inside as well as through diffusion from the outside.  A lack of oxygen will cause degenerative alterations, ranging from premature aging, to surface damage, and even as extensive as causing open wounds.  The cause for the lack of oxygen may be a part of the normal aging process, but it may also be caused by burns, radiation, trauma, or a medical condition.  Impairment of the blood flow, for example caused by diabetes mellitus or by chronic venous insufficiency, can also lead to insufficient oxygen supply and the resulting skin damage. 
   
 Sales of this series have remained at a low level throughout the first nine months of our 2016 fiscal year. During the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year we decided to decrease our operations in this particular segment and to abandon the patent protection for this range of products. 
   
  Chitoskin Wound Pads  
   
 Usually, normal (   primary   ) wounds tend to heal over a couple of days without leaving scars following a certain sequence of phases. Burns and certain diseases impede the normal wound healing process, resulting in large, hardly healing (   secondary   ) wounds which only close by growing new tissue from the bottom. Wound dressings serve to safeguard the wound with its highly sensitive new granulation tissue from mechanical damage as well as from infection. Using the natural polymer chitosan, Sangui   s Chitoskin wound dressings show outstanding properties in supporting wound healing. 
   
 It is the strategy of the company to find industry partners ready to acquire or license this product range as a whole. 

Hemospray Wound Spray  
   
 SanguiBioTech GmbH has developed a novel medical technology supporting the healing of chronic wounds. Lack of oxygen supply to the cells in the wound ground is the main reason why those wounds lose their genuine healing power. Based on its concept of artificial oxygen carriers, our wound spray product bridges the watery wound surface and permits an enhanced afflux of oxygen to the wound ground. 
   
 In December 2010, SanguiBioTech GmbH established SastoMed GmbH, a joint venture company with SanderStrothmann GmbH of Georgsmarienh tte, Germany. SanguiBioTech GmbH has granted SastoMed GmbH global distribution rights. SastoMed GmbH started to distribute the product in Germany after having obtained the CE mark authorizing the distribution of the wound spray in the countries of the European Union in April 2012. 
   
 As licensor SanguiBioTech GmbH is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by SastoMed from sales of the Granulox product (based on SastoMed selling prices). The percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries and thus well above the average licensing rate of 7.5% of sales revenues as calculated by market analysts. In addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at SastoMed will have exceeded the total of    50,000,000. 
   
 In September 2011, the Mexican Health Authorities registered the entire current range of Sangui developed wound management products and thus granted the authorization to apply and sell these products on a nationwide level.  
   
 On April 5, 2012, SastoMed GmbH notified SanguiBioTech GmbH that the wound spray product was granted a certification as class III medical product. The CE mark according to sections 6  and 7 of the German Medical Devices Act authorizes production, distribution and sales of the product in all member countries of the European Union. According to SastoMed GmbH, sales of the product under the brand name    Granulox    started in Germany on April 16, 2012, other markets will be addressed in due course. 
   
 In August, 2012, Sangui BioTech GmbH and SastoMed GmbH cordially adjusted the existing sales strategy. In consideration of corresponding contributions the existing licensing contract was partially complemented resulting in the following conditions: As licensor SanguiBioTech GmbH is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by SastoMed from sales of the Granulox product (based on SastoMed selling prices). The percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries. In addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at SastoMed will have exceeded the total of    50,000,000. 
   
 In December, 2012, actual distribution of the product was initiated in Mexico under the management of SastoMed GmbH and their local distribution partner Bio-Mac Pharma. International distribution has been expanded since then through cooperation agreements with local distribution partners in the Benelux countries and South Eastern Europe. 
   
 In May, 2013, the Company declared in the course of the filing of its nine month report on form 10-QSB that  according to information provided by SastoMed GmbH  it now expects the 8Granulox market entry phase to last longer than initially expected. No assurance can be given that based on royalty revenues the Company may reach break-even in the course of its current financial year. 
   
 Since December 2013, international distribution outside Germany was initiated in collaboration with local partners in more than 40 countries in Europe and Latin American. 
   
 Effective December 31, 2015 Sangui BioTech GmbH sold its stake in Sastomed GmbH of 25% to SanderStrohmann GmbH . Also effective December 31, 2015 SanderStrohmann GmbH increased the nominal capital of Sastomed GmbH for an amount of Euro 500,000 to strengthen the capital base of Sastomed GmbH. 
   
 It has to be noted, however, that Granulox sales by our distribution  partner SastoMed GmbH have become more volatile and declining from time to time.. We remain confident, however, that SastoMed will be able to considerably increase its sales along with more international markets entering actual distribution of the product. 
   
  FINANCIAL POSITION  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total assets increased $25,454 from $110,419 at June 30, 2016 to $135,873 at September 30, 2016.  An increase in the cash on hand from June 30 2016, to September 30, 2016, of $30,048 was primarily responsible for the increase in the total assets. 
   
 We funded our operations primarily through our existing cash reserves and cash received from the issuance of shares of common stock. Our stockholders    equity (deficit) decreased by $38,736 from ($247,566) at June 30, 2016 to (208,830) at September 30, 2016. The primary factor behind this was due to the issuance of stock for cash for $10,787, and an increase to accumulated deficit of $16,900, as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to movements in the foreign exchange rate. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  
   
 REVENUES     Revenues reported were $9,711 and $11,471 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Revenues decreased by $1,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease by $1,760 from the revenues in the comparable period of our 2016 financial year can be traced back to a decrease in royalties from the licensing agreement with SastoMed GmbH. Cost of sales in the first quarter were $282 and $85 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  
   
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT     Research and development expenses decreased by $29,632 to $4,420 from $34,052 for the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015.  This decrease is mainly attributed to lower R D expenses after the conclusion of the animal tests of our hemoglobin hyperpolymers. The company has no plans to start activities in this area within the near future again. 
   
 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE and PROFESSIONAL FEES     For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the combined general and administrative expenses and professional fees decreased by $63,858 from $138,760 mainly due to lower renumeration for general managemt and outside services.  
   
 INTEREST EXPENSE - Interest expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,782 and $1,401, an increase of $381. 
   
 NET LOSS - As a result of the above factors, the net loss attributed to common shareholders decreased to  a loss of $67,900  compared to $ 150,328    for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The loss per share for both periods was $(0.00).  Our consolidated net loss before non-controlling interest was $71,675, or $(0.00) per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $162,827, or $(0.00) per common share, during the comparable period in our 2015 financial year. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities increased $19,005 to $79,233, compared to $60,228    used  in the previous year.  Major components of the decrease in the cash used included a decrease in the net loss from $(162,827) to $(71,675) from 2015 to 2016. 
   
 We had a working capital deficit of approximately $208,830 at September 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $38,736 from June 30, 2016.  
   
  At September 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2016, we had cash of $100,122 compared to $70,074, prepaid expenses of $25,847 compared to $30,292 and accounts receivable of $460 compared $504. We will need substantial additional funding to fulfill our business plan and we intend to explore financing sources for our future development activities.  No assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful.
