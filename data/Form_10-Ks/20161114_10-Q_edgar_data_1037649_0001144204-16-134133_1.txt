  (UNAUDITED)  

Note 1 Basis of Presentation  

Interleukin Genetics, Inc. ( the Company )
develops genetic tests for sale into the emerging personalized health market and performs testing services that can help individuals
improve and maintain their health through preventive or therapeutic measures. The Company s principal operations and markets
are located in the United States. 

The accompanying condensed
financial statements include the accounts of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

The financial statements
have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed financial statements, which in the opinion of management
reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation, should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future interim
period or for the entire 2016 fiscal year. 

For information regarding
our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 3 to our condensed financial statements contained herein. 

Note 2 Operating Matters and Liquidity  

The Company has experienced
net operating losses since its inception through September 30, 2016. The Company had net losses of $7.9 million and $6.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, contributing
to an accumulated deficit of $134.6 million as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company continues
to take steps to reduce genetic test processing costs. Cost savings are primarily achieved through test process improvements. Management
believes that the current laboratory space is adequate to process high volumes of genetic tests. 

On December 23, 2014,
the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2014 Purchase Agreement ) with various accredited investors
(the  2014 Investors ), pursuant to which the Company sold to the 2014 Investors in a private placement transaction
(the  December 2014 Private Placement ) an aggregate of 50,099,700 shares of common stock at a price of $0.1003 per
share for gross proceeds of approximately $5.025 million. The 2014 Investors also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of 50,099,700 shares of common stock an exercise price of $0.1003 per share (the  2014 Warrants ). The 2014 Warrants
vested immediately, are all currently exercisable and have a term of seven years. 

On December
23, 2014, the Company entered into a Venture Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with
Horizon Technology Finance Corporation (the  Lender ) under which the Company borrowed $5.0 million. The loan
originally bore interest at a floating rate equal to the One Month LIBOR Rate (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 8.50%. The loan
was to be repaid in forty-five (45) monthly payments consisting of fifteen (15) monthly payments of only interest followed by
thirty (30) equal monthly payments of principal and interest. In addition, at the end of the repayment term (or at early
termination of the loan) a final payment equal to 4.5% of the loan would have been due and payable. The Company s
obligations under the Loan Agreement were secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of its assets
other than its intellectual property. The Company had also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber its intellectual
property assets, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued to the Lender and
its affiliates warrants to purchase a total of 2,492,523 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.1003 per share,
which the Company refers to herein as the 2014 Lender Warrants. The 2014 Lender Warrants vested immediately, are all
currently exercisable and have a term of ten (10) years. 

On August 25,
2016, the Company and the Lender entered into the First Amendment of Venture Loan and Security Agreement and an Amended and
Restated Secured Promissory Note (collectively referred to herein as the  2016 Debt Restructuring ), which was
effective as of August 1, 2016, pursuant to which the principal payments due from August 2016 through December 2016 will be
reduced to 33% of the principal payments due for these periods under the Loan Agreement. Principal payments may also be
reduced in future periods upon the achievement of certain milestones by the Company. In consideration of these changes, (i)
the Company paid the Lender an amendment fee of $25,000 and reimbursed the Lender s legal expenses in the amount of
$5,000, (ii) the Company granted the Lender a first priority security interest in substantially all of its assets, including
its intellectual property, (iii) the interest rate of the loan has been increased to 11.00% plus the amount by which the one
month LIBOR Rate exceeds 0.50%, and (iv) the final payment was increased from 4.5% of the loan, or $225,000, to 6.5% of the
loan, or $325,000. At September 30, 2016, the interest rate was 11.03% per annum. In connection with the 2016 Debt
Restructuring, the Company also issued to the Lender an additional warrant to purchase up to 5,169,577 shares of the
Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.0994 per share (the  2016 Lender Warrant ). The 2016
Lender Warrant vested immediately, is currently exercisable and has a term of ten (10) years. If the milestones required
to further reduce the principal payments are achieved, the Lender shall be entitled to additional warrants. 

On July 29, 2016,
the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with various accredited
investors (the  2016 Investors ), pursuant to which the Company sold to the 2016 Investors in a private placement
transaction (the  2016 Private Placement ) an aggregate of 56,262,571 shares of common stock at a price of
$0.0994 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. The 2016 Investors also received warrants to purchase up
to an aggregate of 56,262,571 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0994 per share (the  2016
Warrants ). The 2016 Warrants vested immediately, are all currently exercisable and have a term of seven years. 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertain realization. The Company expects to
incur additional losses in 2016 and beyond, accordingly, is dependent on financings and potential revenue to fund its
operations and support the market adoption of the ILUSTRA     I nflammation
Management Program (the  ILUSTRA Program ), which includes the ILUSTRA Genetic Risk Test (the  ILUSTRA
Test , formerly referred to as the PerioPredict    Genetic Risk Test). The timing of any revenues that the
Company may receive from the ILUSTRA Program is uncertain at this time, and is contingent upon a number of factors, including
the Company s ability to attract employer and insurance carriers as customers directly, to consummate arrangements
with additional partners to promote the ILUSTRA Program, our partners  ability to attract customers for the ILUSTRA
Program, and the timing of utilization of the ILUSTRA Program by customers, among other possible variables. The Company
expects that its current cash and cash equivalents sufficient to support the Company s operations into the second
quarter of 2017.  

The ability of the
Company to realize the carrying value of its fixed assets and intangible assets is especially dependent on management s ability
to successfully execute on its plan. The Company needs to generate additional funds in order to meet its financial obligations.
If it is unsuccessful in doing so, the Company may not be able to realize the carrying value of its fixed assets and intangible
assets. 

Note 3 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Management Estimates  

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s most critical accounting policies are more fully
discussed in these notes to the financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue from genetic
testing services is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, service has been rendered, the sales price
is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Service is deemed to be rendered when the results have been reported
to the individual who ordered the test. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $881,000 of revenue
associated with genetic testing compared to $922,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. To the extent that tests have
been prepaid but results have not yet been reported, recognition of all related revenue is deferred. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred revenue of $2.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Included in deferred revenue
at September 30, 2016 is $2.4 million for kits that are still outstanding one year or longer after initial kit sale, of which $0.15
million was sold directly to consumers (credit card payments) and $2.27 million was sold to distributors as a promotional bundle.
In 2012 and 2013, Access Business Group LLC ( ABG ), an affiliate of Alticor, Inc., a related party ( Alticor ),
placed purchase orders totaling approximately $3.3 million for Weight Management test kits. The kits were included as part of a
promotional bundle of products that ABG sold to their Individual Business Owners (IBOs). 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $465,000 and $1.4 million in Other revenue,   respectively,
compared to $47,000 and $154,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,   respectively.
Of the $1.4 million of Other revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $1.2 million was related to contracted
research revenue and $160,000 was related to royalties received related to our license agreement with ABG. Of the $154,000 of Other
revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $5,000 was related to contracted research revenue and $149,000
was related to royalties received related to our license agreement with ABG. Revenue from contracted research projects is recognized
when the deliverables for which the Company is obligated have been provided to the customer who contracted the project.  

The Company recognizes
breakage revenue related to genetic test kits utilizing the remote method. Under the remote method, breakage revenue should be
recognized when the likelihood of the customer exercising rights of redemption becomes remote. The term remote requires statistical
analysis of customer redemption patterns for all tests sold and returned. The Company analyzed redemption patterns from 2009 through
2015 and determined the period of time after which the likelihood of test redemption was remote was three years after the sale
of a genetic test kit. Included in genetic test revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $41,000 and $171,000,
respectively, of breakage revenue related to unredeemed genetic test kits sold in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2013, respectively, compared to genetic test revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $39,000 and $167,000,
respectively, related to unredeemed genetic test kits sold in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively.
The Company expects to continue to recognize breakage revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of goods on a quarterly basis
based on the historical analysis. 

Sales Commission  

On October 26, 2009,
the Company entered into a Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Corp., d/b/a/ Amway Global ( Amway Global ),
a subsidiary of Alticor Inc. Pursuant to this Agreement, Amway Global sells the Company s Inherent Health   
brand of genetic tests through its e-commerce website via a hyperlink to our e-commerce site. The Company accounts for sales commissions
due to Amway Global under the Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB )
104. Commissions are recorded as an expense at the time they become due, which is at the point of sale. The cost of commissions
was $37,000 and $70,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $189,000 and $239,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.. 

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable
is stated at estimated net realizable value, which is generally the invoiced amount less any estimated discount related to payment
terms. The Company offers its commercial genetic test customers a 2% cash discount if payment is made by bank wire transfer within
10 days of the invoice date. No accounts receivable reserve is required at September 30, 2016 as all accounts receivable are
expected to be collected. 

Inventory  

Inventory is carried
at lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market and no inventory reserve was deemed necessary at December 31, 2015 or September
30, 2016. As the Company does not manufacture any products, no overhead costs are included in inventory. Inventory is stored at
a fulfillment provider. 

Inventory consisted
of the following: 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation . The
standard addresses all forms of share-based payment (SBP) awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans,
stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. We expense SBP awards within compensation cost for SBP transactions
measured at fair value. Compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that
are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date.
The compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated under
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Common stock purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based
upon the fair market value in excess of purchase price. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of taxes payable or
refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based
on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The Company records
a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 

Significant management
judgment is required in determining the Company s provision (benefit) for income taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities
and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets of approximately $35.6 million as of September 30, 2016, due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize
these assets. The valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the Company
operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these
estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust its valuation allowance, which
could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. 

As a result of the
Company s change in its capital structure during the quarters ended June 30, 2013, December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2016
the Company may have undergone IRC section 382 ownership changes which would limit its ability to realize the benefit of its tax
attributes (i.e., federal/state net operating losses and research and development credits) during their respective carry forward
periods. The Company has not performed an analysis to determine the extent of such limitations, if any. 

The Company reviews
its recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. The Company reviews all material tax positions for all years open to statute to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the positions taken would be sustained based on the technical merits of those positions. The Company
did not recognize any adjustments for uncertain tax positions as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Research and Development  

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common
Share  

The Company applies the provisions of FASB
ASC 260,  Earnings per Share , which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share. Basic and
diluted net loss per share was determined by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for
all the periods presented, as the effect of the potential common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive due to the loss in each period.
Potential common stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share are as follows: 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company, using
available market information, has determined the estimated fair values of financial instruments. The stated values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments.
The fair value of warrants is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company maintains
its cash and cash equivalents with a domestic financial institution that the Company believes to be of high credit standing. The
Company believes that, as of September 30, 2016, its concentration of credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents was not
significant. Cash and cash equivalents are available on demand and are generally in excess of FDIC insurance limits. 

Fixed Assets  

Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or
the remaining term of the lease. 

Segment Reporting  

As of September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company has one segment, the genetic test business. The Company develops genetic tests for sale into the emerging
personalized health market and performs testing services that can help individuals improve and maintain their health through preventive
measures. The Company s principal operations and markets are located in the United States. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

FASB ASC 606 ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from
contracts with customers.  

In May 2014, the FASB
issued amended guidance on contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial
assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The guidance
requires an entity to recognize revenue on contracts with customers to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The guidance requires that an entity depict the consideration by applying the following five steps: 

Identify the contract(s) with a customer.   

Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   

Determine the transaction price.   

Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   

Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   

The amendments in this
ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting
period. Early application is not permitted. This amendment is to be either retrospectively adopted to each prior reporting period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. 

In April, 2015 the
FASB voted to defer the required implementation date of ASU 2014-09 to December 2017. Public companies may elect to adopt the standard
along the original timeline. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance to determine whether or not
it has a material impact on its financial statements. 

FASB ASC 606 ASU 2014-15 - Presentation of Financial Statements Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40); Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  

In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which applies should a company be facing probable liquidation within one year of the issuance of the
financial statements, but is not actually in liquidation at the time of issuance.  The applicable basis for presentation remains
as a going concern, but if liquidation within one year is probable, then certain disclosures must be included in the financial
statement presentation.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-15 on our financial disclosures, but is not electing early
adoption at this time. 

FASB ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842).  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). The updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information
about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU No. 2016-09, - Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  

In March 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09. The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation
arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 4 Related Party Transactions  

Since March 2003, the
Company has maintained a broad strategic alliance with several affiliates of the Alticor Inc. family of companies, a related party.
The alliance initially included an equity investment, a multi-year research and development agreement, a licensing agreement with
royalties on marketed products, the deferment of outstanding loan repayment and the refinancing of bridge financing obligations. 

On October 26, 2009,
the Company entered into a Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Corp., d/b/a/ Amway Global ( Amway Global ),
a subsidiary of Alticor. Pursuant to this Agreement, Amway Global sells the Company s Inherent Health brand of genetic tests
through its e-commerce website via a hyperlink to the Company s e-commerce site. The Company paid Amway Global $37,000 and
$70,000 in commissions for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $189,000 and $239,000 in commissions
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a percentage of net sales to their customers.
The Company expenses commissions owed to Amway Global in the month of sale to the customer. 

In
2012 and 2013, Access Business Group LLC ( ABG ), an affiliate of Alticor placed purchase orders totaling approximately
$3.3 million consisting of the Company s Weight Management test kits. The kits are included as part of a promotional bundle
of products that Amway sells to their Individual Business Owners (IBOs). Of the $3.3 million in orders, $1.5 million was received
for the 2013 program and $1.8 million for the 2014 program. As a component of the 2013 promotional program, and not reflective
of actual product expiry, the kits were required to be redeemed by December 31, 2013. In February 2014, the Company removed the
redemption date requirement for the 2013 promotional program, for which ABG paid the Company $519,000 as a retrospective increase
in the product purchase price. All cash received related to the 2013 promotional program, including the $519,000, will be treated
as deferred revenue until kits are returned for processing or the breakage analysis determines the probability of eventual redemption
is remote .  In October 2014, the Company received
$250,000 as a retrospective increase in the product purchase price for unsold kits as consideration for extending the required
redemption date of the 2014 promotional program to December 31, 2017. All cash received for these kits will be treated as deferred
revenue until specific kits are returned for processing or on the final allowed redemption date of December 31, 2017.  

On September 21, 2012,
the Company entered into a License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Access Business Group International LLC
( ABGI ), an affiliate of Alticor. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company has granted ABGI and its affiliates
a non-exclusive license to use the technology related to the Company s Weight Management genetic test and to sell the Weight
Management test in Europe, Russia and South Africa (the  Territories ). ABGI, or a laboratory designated by ABGI, will
be responsible for processing the tests, and the Company will receive a royalty for each test sold, which royalty will increase
if certain pending patent applications are issued. The License Agreement has an initial term of five years from the date of first
commercial sale of the Weight Management test under the agreement which was in June 2013. Thereafter, the term will automatically
renew for additional one-year periods unless at least 60 days prior notice is delivered by either party. During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, $47,000 and $153,000, respectively, related to license fees was earned, compared to $39,000 and
$142,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In connection with
the execution of the License Agreement, the Company and ABGI also entered into a Professional Services Agreement (the  PSA )
pursuant to which the Company has agreed to provide services to ABGI in connection with its sale and processing of the tests within
the Territories. No fees were earned in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 24% and 45%, respectively, of the Company s revenue came from sales through
the Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Global, and 3% and 14%, respectively, of revenue came from sales
through ABG s promotional product bundle program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 23%
and 49%, respectively, of the Company s revenue came from sales through our Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement
with Amway Global, and 4% and 15%, respectively, of revenue came from sales through ABG s promotional product bundle program. 

On February 25, 2013, the Company entered into a Preferred Participation
Agreement with Renaissance Health Services Corporation ( RHSC ), for itself and on behalf of certain of its affiliates
and subsidiaries. This agreement was amended and restated on November 1, 2013. RHSC is a related party through its affiliation
with Delta Dental of Michigan, Inc. ( DDMI ), a stockholder of the Company.     Pursuant to this agreement,
as amended, affiliates of RHSC agreed to reimburse the Company a fixed price for each ILUSTRA Test that the Company processed for
a customer of affiliates of RHSC. This amended agreement had a term of three years beginning February 25, 2013and terminated on
February 25, 2016. A revised agreement with substantially similar terms was executed in April 2016.

5 Debt Instruments  

Venture Loan and Security Agreement  

On December
23, 2014, the Company entered into a Venture Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with
Horizon Technology Finance Corporation (the  Lender ) under which the Company borrowed $5.0 million. The loan
bore interest at a floating rate equal to the One Month LIBOR Rate (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 8.50%. In the event that the
One Month LIBOR Rate, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, exceeds 0.50%, the interest rate would have been adjusted by
an amount equal to the difference between such rates at the end of that particular month. The loan was to be repaid
in forty-five (45) monthly payments consisting of fifteen (15) monthly payments of only interest followed by thirty (30)
equal monthly payments of principal and interest (the  Payment Terms ). In addition, at the end of the repayment
term (or at early termination of the loan) a final payment equal to 4.5% of the loan would have been due and payable.
The Company s obligations under the Loan Agreement were secured by a first priority security interest in substantially
all of its assets other than its intellectual property. The Company had also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber
its intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued to
the Lender and its affiliates warrants to purchase a total of 2,492,523 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$0.1003 per share, which the Company refers to herein as the 2014 Lender Warrants. The 2014 Lender Warrants vested
immediately, are all currently exercisable and have a term of ten (10) years. 

On August 25,
2016, the Company and the Lender entered into the First Amendment of Venture Loan and Security Agreement and an Amended and
Restated Secured Promissory Note (collectively referred to herein as the  2016 Debt Restructuring ), which was
effective as of August 1, 2016, pursuant to which the principal payments due from August 2016 through December 2016 will be
reduced to 33% of the principal payments due for these periods under the Loan Agreement. Principal payments may also be
reduced in future periods upon the achievement of certain milestones by the Company. In consideration of these changes, (i)
the Company paid the Lender an amendment fee of $25,000 and reimbursed the Lender s legal expenses in the amount of
$5,000, (ii) the Company granted the Lender a first priority security interest in substantially all of its assets, including
its intellectual property, (iii) the interest rate of the loan has been increased to 11.00% plus the amount by which the one
month LIBOR Rate exceeds 0.50%, and (iv) the final payment was increased from 4.5% of the loan, or $225,000, to 6.5% of the
loan, or $325,000. At September 30, 2016, the interest rate was 11.03% per annum. In connection with the 2016 Debt
Restructuring, the Company also issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase up to 5,169,577 shares of the
Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.0994 per share (the  2016 Lender Warrant ). The 2016
Lender Warrant vested immediately, is currently exercisable and has a term of ten (10) years. If the milestones required to
further reduce the principal payments are achieved, the Lender shall be entitled to additional warrants. 

The Company recorded
a discount on the loan comprised of (i) $89,000 in cash fees paid to the Lender related to the Loan Agreement, (ii) $261,000 as
the intrinsic value of the 2014 Lender Warrants, (iii) $30,000 in cash fees paid to the Lender related to the 2016 Debt Restructuring
and (iv) $504,000 as the intrinsic value of the 2016 Lender Warrants. The discount on the loan is amortized over the term of the
loan in the Company s Condensed Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized discount associated with
the loan was $661,000. The amended final non-principal payment of $325,000 will be accrued as additional interest expense, using
the effective interest method, over the term of the loan. Cash interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $115,000 and $339,000, respectively, and $115,000 and $341,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. Non-cash interest expense was $109,000 and $185,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $38,000
and $115,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

which provided for adequate authorized shares for all potential common stock equivalents issued pursuant to the May 2013 Private
Placement. The 2013 Warrants are all currently exercisable and have a term of seven years from the date they became exercisable. 

For its services in
this transaction, the placement agent received cash compensation in the amount of approximately $780,000 and the placement agent
and an affiliate received warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,295,082 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $0.2745

2013, following shareholder approval of an increase in the Company s authorized shares of common stock and expire August
9, 2020. The cash compensation and the fair value of the warrants were recorded as issuance costs resulting in a reduction to shareholders 
equity. 

In connection with
the May 2013 Private Placement, all preferred stockholders converted their shares of Preferred Stock to common stock resulting
in the issuance of 39,089,161 shares of common stock (the  2013 Preferred Conversion ) and $14,316,255 in principal

this transaction, the placement agent and legal counsel received an aggregate of $218,000 in cash fees and the placement agent
received warrants to purchase an aggregate of 89,731 shares of common stock ( 2014 Placement Agent Warrants ). The

Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements  

Total stock-based compensation
is as follows: 

Stock option and restricted stock grants  

The following table details stock option activity: 

As of September 30, 2016
and 2015, there was approximately $1.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation related to non-vested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company s stock plans. 

Restricted Stock Awards  

At September 30, 2016 and
2015, there were no outstanding restricted stock awards. 

Stock Option Grants  

On August 9, 2013, the
Company s shareholders  approved the 2013 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the  2013
Plan ). The 2013 Plan allows for the issuance of up to 8,860,000 additional shares of the Company s common stock pursuant
to awards granted under the 2013 Plan. Additionally, the 2013 Plan allows for the issuance of up to a maximum of 2,435,500 additional
shares of the Company s common stock, pursuant to the cancellation, forfeiture, or expiry, of awards granted under the 2004
Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan and terminated on or after the 2013 Plan approval on August 9, 2013. On July 21, 2015,
the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available
for issuance thereunder by 30,000,000 shares. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted 1,185,400
stock options under the 2013 Plan. At September 30, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of 30,158,249 shares of common stock available
for grant under the 2013 Plan. 

Per his employment agreement,
Mark Carbeau was entitled to receive a grant of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock equal to 5% of the
number of shares of the Company s stock issued in the 2016 Private Placement, assuming the conversion of all convertible
securities issued in the 2016 Private Placement, which equals 5,626,257 shares, at a per share exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Plan, the Company
cannot issue options or other grants for more than 5,000,000 shares to any one person in a calendar year. Consequently, on October
20, 2016, the Company granted Mr. Carbeau options to purchase 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of $0.17544 per share and expects to grant the remaining options to which Mr. Carbeau is entitled in 2017. These options
will vest as to 25% of the shares on July 29, 2017 and as to an additional 2.083% of the shares on the last day of each successive
month thereafter, provided that Mr. Carbeau remains employed by Company on the vesting date. See Note 10   Subsequent Events. 

Per
his employment agreement, Stephan Toutain was entitled to receive a grant of options to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock equal to 1% of the Company s fully diluted shares as of his start date at an exercise price equal to fair market
value of the Company s common stock on the grant date of the option. Consequently, on October 20, 2016, the Company granted
Mr. Toutain options to purchase 3,738,933 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.17544 per share.
These options will vest as to 25% of the shares on August 15, 2017, and as to an additional 2.083% of the shares monthly thereafter. 
 See Note 10   Subsequent Events.  

It is the Company s
policy to grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the
grant date, and stock options to employees generally vest over four years based upon continuous service. Historically, the majority
of the Company s stock options have been granted in connection with the employee s start date with the Company. In
addition, the Company may grant stock options in recognition of promotion and/or performance. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

Purchases made under the
Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan are deemed to be compensatory because employees may purchase stock at a price equal
to 85% of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on either the first day or the last day of a calendar quarter,
whichever is lower. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, employees purchased 179,952 and 157,705 shares, respectively,
of common stock at a weighted-average purchase price of $0.06 and $0.11, respectively, while the weighted-average market value
was $0.08 and $0.13 per share, respectively, resulting in compensation expense of $1,921 and $3,129, respectively. 

Note 9 Industry Risk and Concentration  

The Company develops genetic
risk assessment tests and performs research for its own benefit. As of September 30, 2016, the Company sells five genetic risk
assessment tests. Commercial success of the Company s genetic risk assessment tests will depend on their success at being
deemed to be scientifically credible and cost-effective by consumers and the marketing success of the Company and its collaborative
partners. 

Research in the field of
disease predisposing genes and genetic markers is intense and highly competitive. The Company has many competitors in the United
States and abroad that have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources available. If the Company
does not discover disease predisposing genes or genetic markers and develop risk assessment tests and launch such services or products
before its competitors, then the potential for significant revenues may be reduced or eliminated. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 24% and 45%, respectively, of the Company s revenue came from sales through
the Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Global, and 3% and 14%, respectively, of the Company s revenue
came from sales through ABG s promotional product bundle program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
approximately 23% and 49%, respectively, of the Company s revenue came from sales through the Merchant Network and Channel
Partner Agreement with Amway Global, and 4% and 15%, respectively, of the Company s revenue came from sales through ABG s
promotional product bundle program.

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements
and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.  

General Overview and Trends  

Interleukin Genetics, Inc.
develops and markets proprietary genetic tests for chronic diseases and health-related conditions. Our products provide information
that is not otherwise available to empower individuals and their healthcare providers to manage their health and wellness through
genetics-based insights and actionable guidance. We leverage our research, intellectual property, and genetic test development
expertise in inflammation and metabolism to identify an individual s risk for severe and progressive chronic inflammatory
diseases, thereby enabling personalized healthcare. We market our tests through healthcare professionals, partnerships with health
and wellness companies, and other distribution channels. We have patents covering the use of specific patterns of gene variations
for a number of common chronic diseases. Our lead products are our proprietary ILUSTRA Program, which identifies individuals with
an increased risk for severe and progressive periodontitis due to a life-long genetic predisposition to over-produce Interleukin-1
(IL-1), a key mediator of inflammation, and seeks to improve outcomes and lower healthcare costs through improved management of
inflammation, and our Inherent Health line of genetic tests. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, our principal focus has been on commercializing our ILUSTRA Program. The ILUSTRA Program serves
as a central component to an enhanced benefit design or wellness initiative directed to lower medical costs through disease avoidance
and reduced disease progression and complications. The program includes a genetic risk test that identifies individuals at high
risk for elevated systemic inflammation, enabling a risk stratification framework to personalize care interventions and patient
outreach. The program creates value through early identification of risk, elevated professional surveillance for disease detection,
and enhanced patient engagement and compliance. 

We
market the ILUSTRA Program to large employers, who are typically self-insured, and to insurance carriers. Our employer customers
see value in the potential reduction of medical costs associated with the highly prevalent inflammatory diseases that our program
can provide. Within the insurance carrier segment, we place particular emphasis on carriers with dental-medical integration (DMI)
products, either in place or in development, and integrated delivery networks (IDNs), as these customers are best positioned to
realize value from the potential reduction of medical costs associated with the highly prevalent inflammatory diseases   that
our program can provide.   

We
pursue these customers through our internal team and through consultants and other third parties, including channel partners, primarily
benefits consulting firms, who may be helpful to identify, and facilitate initial interactions with, potential customers. We had
established two such relationships by September 30, 2016, with Employee Benefit Consulting Group LLC (EBCG), a firm with expertise
in the U.S. insurance market and strong relationships with employers, insurance carriers, and health and wellness providers, and
with Comprehensive Benefit Administrators ( CBA ), which has included the ILUSTRA Program as part of its Freedom Dental
Plan that CBA promotes to their customers. In July, we signed an agreement with   Amway,
a leading direct selling company, to provide the ILUSTRA Program to Amway s employees as part of an enhanced employee benefits
plan.   

The timing of any revenues
that we may receive from our marketing efforts is very uncertain at this time and is dependent on a number of variables, many of
which we may have a limited ability to influence. We may never receive significant revenues for the ILUSTRA Program. 

We process test samples
in our CLIA-certified genetic testing laboratory, which must hold certain licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct our
business. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention
or treatment of disease or assessment of health are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). CLIA
requires such a laboratory to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel,
facilities, administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate,
reliable and timely. Requirements for testing under CLIA vary based on the level of complexity of the testing performed. Laboratories
performing high complexity tests, such as genetic tests, must comply with more stringent requirements than laboratories performing
moderate or waived testing. Our laboratory was most recently inspected in September 2015 and no deficiencies or other issues were
noted, and our CLIA license was renewed.  

On April 5, 2016, we announced
the results of discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in response to an Untitled Letter issued by the FDA
on November 4, 2015 and a meeting on February 3, 2016 with personnel within FDA s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological
Health (OIR) to discuss Interleukin s written response to OIR with respect to the Untitled Letter. OIR personnel confirmed
that the ILUSTRA Test is a laboratory developed test (LDT) currently subject to FDA enforcement discretion and may continue to
be marketed without prior marketing authorization at this time. Our Bone Health and Heart Health tests, which are part of the Inherent
Health line of tests, will be transitioned from a direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution channel to a distribution model under which
a licensed healthcare provider orders tests and oversees any resulting change in care. These two tests were available through Interleukin
Genetics  DTC retail channels until May 22, 2016, at which time they were no longer available unless requested by an authorized
healthcare provider. 

Our Inherent Health   brand
of genetic tests includes the first-of-its-kind test for weight management that identifies an individual s genetic tendencies
for weight gain related to either fat or carbohydrates in the diet. The Inherent Health brand also offers customers a full
suite of affordable, easy-to-use and meaningful genetic tests in heart health, bone health and nutritional needs. In addition,
we launched additional products under the name Wellness Select that allows our e-commerce customers to purchase any combination
of our Inherent Health genetic tests at a discounted price. 

We market our Inherent
Health brand of genetic assessment tests primarily through our commercial relationships with Alticor Inc. affiliated companies.
Alticor is a related party. On October 26, 2009, we entered into a Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Corp.,
d/b/a/ Amway Global ( Amway Global ), a subsidiary of Alticor. Pursuant to this agreement, Amway Global sells our Inherent
Health brand of genetic tests through its e-commerce website via a hyperlink to our e-commerce site. In the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from this agreement accounted for approximately 24% and 45% of our revenues, respectively.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from this agreement accounted for approximately 23% and 49% of our
revenues, respectively. 

In 2012 and 2013, Access
Business Group LLC (ABG), an affiliate of Alticor, placed purchase orders totaling approximately $3.3 million consisting of Weight
Management kits. Of the $3.3 million in orders received in 2013, $1.8 million was related to the 2014 program and $1.5 million
was related to the 2013 program. Cash for the kits purchased for the 2013 program was received in the first quarter of 2013 and
cash for the kits purchased for the 2014 program was received by December 31, 2013. As a component of the 2013 promotional program,
and not reflective of actual product expiry, the kits were required to be redeemed before December 31, 2013. In February 2014,
we removed the redemption date requirement for the 2013 promotional program, for which ABG paid us $519,000 as a retrospective
increase in the product purchase price. Cash related to the 2013 promotional program, including the $519,000, will be treated as
deferred revenue until kits are redeemed or the breakage analysis determines the probability of eventual redemption is remote.
In October 2014, we received $250,000 as a retrospective increase in the product purchase price for unsold kits as consideration
for extending the required redemption date of the 2014 promotional program to December 31, 2017. Cash received for these kits will
be treated as deferred revenue until kits are redeemed for processing or on the final allowed redemption date of December 31, 2017.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 3% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue came from sales
through ABG s promotional product bundle program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 4%
and 15%, respectively, of our revenue came from sales through ABG s promotional product bundle program. 

On September 21, 2012,
we entered into a License Agreement with ABGI, an affiliate of Alticor. Pursuant to this License Agreement, we granted ABGI and
its affiliates a non-exclusive license to use the technology related to our Weight Management genetic test and to sell the Weight
Management test in Europe, Russia and South Africa. ABGI, or a laboratory designated by ABGI, is responsible for processing the
tests, and we receive a royalty for each test sold. The License Agreement has an initial term of five years from the date of first
commercial sale of the Weight Management test under the agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $47,000
and $153,000, respectively, related to license fees was earned, compared to $39,000 and $142,000, respectively, for the same period
in 2015.   

Our research and development
expenses are focused on our own development and commercialization efforts related primarily to our ILUSTRA Program and cardiovascular
disease genetic tests. We are also focusing on seeking potential commercial partners to validate our technology within their specific
business model as a collaboration with little or no cost to us. This is different than in prior years when our development focus
was concentrated in research and development to bring new test configurations to market. 

We recognize revenue from
genetic testing services when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, service has been rendered, the sales price is determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured. Service is deemed to be rendered when the results have been reported to the individual
who ordered the test. To the extent that tests have been prepaid but results have not yet been reported, recognition of all related
revenue is deferred. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we concluded that sufficient historical customer genetic test redemption
patterns existed to determine the period of time after which the likelihood of test redemption was remote for Inherent Health tests
purchased. Based on our analysis of the redemption data, we estimate that period of time to be three years after the sale of a
genetic test kit. Prior to making this determination, revenue was recognized only on test kits returned and processed. Beginning
in the fourth quarter of 2013, we began to recognize breakage revenue related to genetic tests kits utilizing the remote method.
Under the remote method, breakage revenue should be recognized when the likelihood of the customer exercising rights of redemption
becomes remote. The term remote requires statistical analysis of customer redemption patterns for all tests sold and returned.
We analyzed redemption patterns from 2009 through 2015. Included in genetic test revenue in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 is $41,000 and $171,000, respectively, of breakage revenue related to unredeemed genetic test kits from the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to $39,000 and $167,000 in the same periods in 2015, of breakage revenue
related to unredeemed genetic test kits from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively. We expect to continue
to recognize breakage revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of goods as well as analyze the data on a quarterly basis based
on the historical analysis. 

In the genetic test business,
competition is in flux and the markets and customer base are not well established. Adoption of new technologies by customers requires
substantial market development and customer education. Historically, we have focused on our relationship with our primary customer,
Alticor, a significant direct marketing company, in order to assist us in developing the market for our products and educating
our potential customers. Our challenge in the remainder 2016 and beyond will be to develop the market for our personalized health
products, in particular our ILUSTRA Program, and we will allocate considerable resources to commercialization of the ILUSTRA Program.
Due to the early stage of this initiative, we cannot predict with certainty fluctuations we may experience in our genetic test
revenues or whether such revenues will ever be material, or if material, will be sustained in future periods. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Total revenue was $734,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016     compared to $296,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The change in total revenue is primarily attributable to contracted research projects recognized in Other revenue. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, 24% of our sales revenue came through our Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Global,
compared to 45% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the same periods, 3% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue
came from sales through ABG s promotional product bundle program. 

Cost of revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, was $443,000, or 60% of total revenue, compared to $323,000, or 109% of total revenue, for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the fixed laboratory costs being applied to higher revenue in the period, which
was due to contracted research projects. 

Research and development
expenses were $418,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $412,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses were $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The 19% increase is primarily attributable to recruiting fees and compensation related to new staff in sales and marketing
and higher consulting costs partially offset by lower commissions related to our Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement
with Amway Global and lower accounting fees. 

Interest expense was $154,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $153,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The interest
expense is entirely related to the Loan Agreement with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation (the  Lender ) entered
into on December 23, 2014, as restructured in August 2016. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Total revenue was $2.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016     compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The change in total revenue is largely attributable to contracted research projects, partially offset by a decrease in
kits returned for processing related to ABG s promotional product bundle. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, 23% of our sales revenue came through our Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement
with Amway Global, compared to 49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the same periods, 4% and 15%,
respectively, of our revenue came from sales through ABG s promotional product bundle program. 

Cost of revenue for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1.3 million, or 58% of total revenue, compared to 986,000, or 92% of total
revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the fixed laboratory costs being applied to higher revenue
in the period, which was due to contracted research projects. 

Research and development
expenses were $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $979,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The 38% increase of $371,000 is primarily attributable to expenses related to Dr. Kornman moving back to the R D
department in April 2015 as President and Chief Scientific Officer from his previous position as CEO. While he served as CEO, expenses
generated by Dr. Kornman were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in research and development
expenses was also partially due to increased compensation expense related to annual salary increases for existing staff and our
patient engagement study. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses were $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The 2% increase is primarily attributable to higher legal and consulting expenses partially offset by lower recruiting
and patent fees as well as lower commissions related to our Merchant Network and Channel Partner Agreement with Amway Global. 

Interest expense was $454,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $456,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The interest expense
is entirely related to our venture loan and security agreement with the Lender entered into on December 23, 2014, as restructured
in August 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 million. 

On July 29, 2016, we
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with various accredited investors
(the  2016 Investors ), pursuant to which we sold to the 2016 Investors in a private placement transaction (the
 2016 Private Placement ) an aggregate of 56,262,571 shares of common stock at a price of $0.0994 per share for
gross proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. The 2016 Investors also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of
56,262,571 shares of common stock an exercise price of $0.0994 per share (the  2016 Warrants ). The 2016 Warrants
vested immediately, are all currently exercisable and have a term of seven years. 

On August 25, 2016, we and the Lender
agreed to the 2016 Debt Restructuring, which was effective as of August 1, 2016, pursuant to which the principal payments due
from August 2016 through December 2016 will be reduced to 33% of the principal payments due for these periods under the Loan
Agreement. Principal payments may also be reduced in future periods if we achieve certain milestones. In consideration of
these changes, (i) we paid the Lender an amendment fee of $25,000 and reimbursed the Lender s legal expenses in the
amount of $5,000, (ii) we granted the Lender a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including
our intellectual property, (iii) the interest rate of the loan has been increased to 11.00% plus the amount by which the one
month LIBOR Rate exceeds 0.50%, and (iv) the final payment was increased from 4.5% of the loan, or $225,000, to 6.5% of the
loan, or $325,000. At September 30, 2016, the interest rate was 11.03% per annum. In connection with the 2016 Debt
Restructuring, we also issued to the Lender a warrant to purchase up to 5,169,577 shares of our common stock at an exercise
price of $0.0994 per share (the  2016 Lender Warrant ). The 2016 Lender Warrant  vested immediately, is currently
exercisable and has a term of ten (10) years and is initially exercisable for up to 5,169,577 shares. If the
milestones required to further reduce the principal payments are achieved, the Lender shall be entitled to
additional warrants.  

Cash
used in operations was $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Cash used in operations is primarily impacted by operating results and changes in working capital, particularly the timing
of the collection of related party receivables, inventory levels, receipt of orders and the timing of payments to suppliers.  

Cash used in investing
activities was $55,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $41,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The majority of the $55,000 in 2016 relates to the cost of creating our new product website. The majority of the $41,000
in 2015 relates to the purchase of new computer equipment. 

Cash provided by financing
activities was $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In July 2016 the Company received approximately $5.5 million, net of expenses,
from the 2016 Private Placement. This was partially offset by $722,000 in principal payments related to our venture loan and security
agreement with the Lender entered into on December 23, 2014, as restructured in August 2016.The Company received $10,000 from stock
purchases through the employee stock purchase plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $17,000 received through the employee stock purchase plan for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 was offset by $7,100 in additional fees related to the December 2014 Private Placement. 

The amount of cash we
generate from operations is currently not sufficient to continue to fund operations and grow our business. We expect our
current cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to support operations into the second quarter of 2017. We believe our
success depends on our ability to generate significant revenues for the ILUSTRA Program. The timing of any revenues that we
may receive for the ILUSTRA Program is uncertain at this time, and is contingent upon a number of factors, including our
ability to attract employer and insurance carriers as customers directly, to consummate arrangements with additional partners
to promote the ILUSTRA Program, our partners  ability to attract customers for the ILUSTRA Program, and the timing
of utilization of the ILUSTRA   program by customers, among other possible variables. We do not expect to receive
any material revenues from the ILUSTRA Program until the first half of 2017, at the earliest, and the timing of any such
revenues may be substantially later. We may never receive significant revenues from the ILUSTRA Program. 

Until such time, if ever,
that we generate revenues sufficient to fund operations, we may fund our operations by issuing common stock, debt or other securities
in one or more public or private offerings, as market conditions permit, or through the incurrence of debt from commercial lenders.
However, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether we will be able to achieve these objectives. To the extent that we
raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders
will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.
Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that additional
funds will be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to
us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or cease activities or operations or enter into licenses or other
arrangements with third parties on terms that may be unfavorable to us or sell, license or relinquish rights to develop or commercialize
our products, technologies or intellectual property, or seek protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The financial statements do
not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of these financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires us to (i) make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses; and (ii) disclose contingent assets and liabilities. A critical accounting estimate is an assumption that could have
a material effect on our financial statements if another, also reasonable, amount were used or a change in the estimates is reasonably
likely from period to period. We base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that we consider reasonable
under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences
between our estimates and the actual results, our future financial condition and results of operations will be affected. Our most
critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our financial condition depends, and which involve the most complex or subjective
decisions or assessments are set forth in Note 3 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes in our accounting policies or changes from the methodology
applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As a smaller reporting
company, we have elected scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information required
by this Item 3. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

(a)  Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure
controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)  Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting.  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f))
occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and, in particular, our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set
forth in Part I   Item 2, contains or incorporates a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by
known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be
important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may
vary materially. 

Without limiting the foregoing,
the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects  and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to

have the right to be present in person or through counsel at all legal proceedings with respect to such Claim. Indemnified Party's

Re: Offer Letter of Employment  

Dear Stephan: 

I
am pleased to provide you with this offer letter agreement (the  Letter Agreement ), which provides the terms and conditions
of your anticipated employment by Interleukin Genetics, Inc. ( Interleukin ), which would become effective as of the
Start Date (as defined below). We hope that you choose to join the Interleukin team and look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship. 

1.                  
  Start Date .   If   you accept this offer,
your employment with Interleukin will begin following the closing of a public or private financing transaction by Interleukin on
a date to be mutually determined by you and Interleukin (the  Start Date ). Nothing contained herein shall confer any
rights to, or obligations on, you or Interleukin prior to the Start Date. 

2.                  
  Position and Responsibilities .   Your initial position will be Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). As an Interleukin
employee, we expect you to devote all of your professional and working time and energies to the business and affairs of Interleukin,
subject to restriction listed on Exhihit A and to perform any and all duties and responsibilities that are associated with this
position and such additional duties and responsibilities that the management of Interleukin otherwise may assign to you. You agree
to abide by all reasonable employment policies instituted by Interleukin, as they may be instituted or amended from time to time.
Your performance will be reviewed on a periodic basis, but no less frequently than annually, as long as you remain employed by
Interleukin. 

3.                  
  At-Will Nature of Relationship .     No provision of this Letter Agreement will
be construed to create an express or implied employment contract, or a promise of employment for any specific period of time. Your
employment with Interleukin is at-will employment which may be terminated by you or Interleukin at any time for any reason (or
for no reason) with or without advance notice, subject to your eligibility for specified types of severance payments upon specified
types of terminations, as described in Section 5  .  

4.                 

     Compensation and Benefits.    

(a)               
 Base Pay.   Your initial base pay will be $315,000 on an annualized basis (your  Base Pay ), less applicable
taxes and standard withholdings and deductions, paid in accordance with Interleukin's standard payroll procedures. Interleukin
will review your Base Pay on an annual basis.

(b)                 Annual
Bonus.    You are eligible to participate in the Interleukin Bonus Plan, with  a
target maximum annual bonus of thirty percent (30%) of your Base Pay for the 2016 Bonus Plan Year. The 2016 annual bonus
period began on January 1, 2016, and your bonus will be pro rated to reflect your Start Date, as well as for any period of
inactive employment. The actual amount of any annual bonus will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Interleukin Board of Directors after assessing Interleukin goals and individual milestones. The annual bonus is expressly
subject to your employment through the date the annual bonus is paid, and will not be earned unless you are employed on such
date. The Board's Compensation Committee has absolute discretion as to whether annual bonuses will be awarded and the size of
any annual bonus, notwithstanding whether any certain corporate goals are met. 

(c)                
     Equity.    Pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Interleukin Genetics Inc. 2013 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan )
and any applicable option agreement, Interleukin will grant you a number of options to purchase shares of common stock of Interleukin
( Common Stock ) equal to one percent (1%) of Interleukin's fully diluted shares as of your Start Date, at an exercise
price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Common Stock on the later of (i) the date of approval of
the grant by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof, or (ii) your Start Date. The option will vest over a four
(4) year period, with 25% of the shares vesting on the  first (1  st  )
anniversary of your Start Date and the remaining shares to vest in thirty-six (36) equal  monthly
installments thereafter. For purposes of this Section 4(c),    fully   diluted
shares  shall mean lnterleukin's outstanding Common Stock plus any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion
of options, warrants or other convertible securities outstanding as of the Start Date.  

(d)               
     Vacation.    You will be entitled to fifteen
(15) days of vacation per year, which will accrue ratably on an annual basis, subject to the terms and conditions of Interleukin's
vacation policy.  

(e)                
     Fringe Benefits.    You may take advantage
of various benefits offered by Interleukin, which currently include group medical and dental insurance, short term disability coverage,
group life insurance, and a 401(k) plan. Please note that Interleukin benefits may be modified, changed or eliminated from time
to time at the sole discretion of Interleukin, and the provision of such benefits to you in no way changes or impacts your status
as an at-will employee. Where a particular benefit is subject to a formal plan (for example, medical insurance), eligibility to
participate in and receive such benefit is governed solely by the applicable plan document.  

(f)                 
     Expense Reimbursement.    Interleukin will
reimburse you for all ordinary and reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by you in furtherance of Interleukin's
business in accordance with Interleukin's policies with respect thereto as in effect from time to time. All reimbursements provided
under this Letter Agreement will be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A ( Section 409A )
of the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations there under (the    Code )
  including, where applicable, the requirement that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred
during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement); (B) the amount of expenses eligible for
reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in  any other calendar year;
(C) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in
which the expense is incurred; and  (D)  the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is
not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

2   

5.                  
      Termination Payments .    As
stated above, your employment with Interleukin is at-will employment, which may be terminated by you or Interleukin at any time
for any reason, with or without advance notice. Notwithstanding for the foregoing, the parties agree to the following regarding
payments on termination following the Start Date.  

(a)               
 Termination without Cause.    If  your employment
hereunder is terminated by Interleukin without Cause (as defined below) at any time, and if you execute and do not revoke a release
agreement in connection with such termination (as described in Section 5(c)), then: 

(i)                   
   Interleukin will pay you an amount equal to your Base Pay in effect at the time of such termination for a period
commencing on the effective date of the release agreement and ending on the six (6) month anniversary of such effective date. 

For
purposes of this section,  Cause  means your: (i) willful misconduct or gross negligence that results in loss, damage
or injury to Interleukin; (ii) unauthorized disclosure of Interleukin trade secrets or confidential and proprietary information;
(iii) dishonesty of a material nature (including, but not limited to, theft or embezzlement of Interleukin funds or assets), willful
disloyalty, or breach of fiduciary duty to Interleukin or its shareholders; (iv) breach of your obligations under this Letter Agreement
(and its exhibit A) or your Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Assignment of Inventions Agreement; (v) failure
to perform your responsibilities or duties as an employee of Interleukin, which failure has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof to you by Interleukin; or (vi) commission of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony (excluding
minor traffic violations). 

(b)               
 Other Termination.   If   your employment hereunder
is terminated by you at any time for any reason, or by Interleukin in any circumstances or for any reason other than those specifically
described in Section 5(a), then you will not be eligible for any form of severance pay, benefits or compensation, other than Accrued
Obligations described below. 

(c)               
Release of Claims; Timing of Payment.   Interleukin will not be obligated to provide you
with any payment or benefit described in Section 5(a) unless you execute and do not revoke a release agreement in a form acceptable
to Interleukin, which will include (at a minimum) a general release of claims against Interleukin and its affiliated entities
and each of their officers, directors, employees and others associated with Interleukin and its affiliated entities. The release
agreement will be provided to you following your separation of service from Interleukin, and must become effective and irrevocable
before the sixtieth  (60th)  day following such separation from service (the  Review Period ).
 If  you sign and do not revoke the release agreement
within the Review Period, then applicable payments and benefits will be made or will commence, as applicable, on Interleukin's
first regular payroll date following the conclusion of the Review Period,  provided  that if the Review Period begins in
one taxable year of yours and ends in a later taxable year of yours, then the payment(s) will commence in the later taxable year. 

3   

(d)              
Payment of Accrued Obligations.   You will be paid the following upon an employment termination, regardless of the reason
therefor and/or the application of any of the above sections: (i) the portion of your Base Pay that is accrued but not yet paid;
(ii) the portion of your vacation that is accrued and not yet used, pursuant to the terms of any applicable Interleukin policy;
and (iii) the business expenses properly incurred by you and not yet reimbursed, pursuant to the terms of any applicable Interleukin
policy. Your entitlement to any other compensation or benefit under any plan of Interleukin will be governed by and determined
in accordance with the terms of such plans. 

6.                  
      Your Certifications .    By
signing this Letter Agreement, you are certifying and representing to Interleukin that: (a) you are free to enter into and fully
perform the duties of your position; (b) you are not subject to any employment, confidentiality, non-competition or other agreement
that would restrict your right to work for Interleukin in any way, and you have provided Interleukin with a copy of any agreement
that could be interpreted as such; (c) your employment with Interleukin does not violate any order, judgment or injunction applicable
to you, and you have provided Interleukin with a copy of any such order, judgment, or injunction; and (d) all facts you have presented
to Interleukin are accurate and true, including all oral and written statements you have made to Interleukin pertaining to your
education, training, qualifications, licensing and prior work experience on any job application, resume or c.v., or in any interview
or discussion with Interleukin.  

7.                  
      Confidentiality and Intellectual Property .   
 Interleukin considers the protection of its confidential information, proprietary materials and intellectual
property to be extremely important. Consequently, as a condition of this offer of employment, prior to your Start Date you will
be required to sign the enclosed Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Assignment of Inventions Agreement. Prior
to accepting employment with any subsequent employer, you will inform such employer of any restrictions set forth therein which
apply to your activities for or employment by such employer, and permit Interleukin to do the same.  

8.                  
      Before You Start .    Prior
to your Start Date, you must complete the upper portion of the enclosed I-9 Form. On your Start Date, you must provide Interleukin

successful completion of a background check conducted by Interleukin's third party provider   , 
 (b)   successful completion of final references and (c) successful
completion of drug screen.  

9.
                  General .  

(a)                    Entire
Agreement.   This Letter Agreement,  along with any other agreement  specifically referenced herein,
constitutes the entire agreement regarding the terms and conditions of your employment by Interleukin, and supersedes any
prior agreements, promises or statements (whether oral or written) regarding the offered terms of employment. 

4   

(b)                 Modification;
Waiver; Assignment.   This Letter Agreement's terms may be modified or amended only by written agreement executed
by the parties hereto. This Letter Agreement's terms may be waived, or consent for the departure therefrom granted, only
by a written document executed by the party entitled to the benefits of such terms or provisions. You may not assign your
rights and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Interleukin. Interleukin may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to any person or entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of lnterleukin's business. 

(c)              
 Choice of Law; Venue; Jury Waiver.   This Letter Agreement will be deemed to have been made in Massachusetts, will
take effect as an instrument under seal within Massachusetts, and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of Massachusetts, without giving effect to conflict of law principles, and specifically excluding any conflict or choice of
law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation to the law of another jurisdiction. Both you and
Interleukin agree that any action, demand, claim or counterclaim relating to or arising under this Letter Agreement will be commenced
in Massachusetts in a court of competent jurisdiction by a judge alone, and you hereby waive and renounce your right to a trial
before a civil jury. 

(d)               
Code Sections 409A and 280G.  

(i)                      The
benefits set forth in Section 5(a) constitute  non-qualified deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A of the
Code. Any termination of your employment triggering payment of benefits under Section 5(a) must constitute a    separation   from
service  under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg.  l .409A-l (h) before distribution of such
benefits can commence. To the extent that the termination of your employment does not constitute a separation of service
under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg.  l.409A-l(h) (as the result of further services that are
reasonably anticipated to be provided by you to Interleukin at the time your employment terminates), any benefits payable
under Section 5(a) that constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A will be delayed until after the date of a
subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg.
 l.409A- l (h). For purposes of clarification, this Section will not cause any forfeiture of benefits on your part, but
will only act as a delay until such time as a  separation from service  occurs. Further, if you are a
 specified employee  (as that term is used in Section 409A and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder) on
the date your separation from service becomes effective, any benefits payable under Section 5(a) that
constitute non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A will be delayed until the earlier of (A) the business
day following the six-month anniversary of   the   date
your separation from service becomes effective, and (B) the date of your death, but only to the extent necessary to avoid the
adverse tax consequences and penalties under Section 409A; on the earlier of (X) the business day following the six-month
anniversary of the date your separation from service becomes effective, and (Y) your death, Interleukin will pay you in a
lump sum the aggregate value of the non-qualified deferred compensation that Interleukin otherwise would have paid you prior
to that date under Section 5(a).  It  is
intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Section 5(a) will be treated as a
separate  payment  for purposes of Section 409A. Neither Interleukin nor you will have the right to accelerate or
defer the delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section
409A.  

5   

(ii)               
    The parties intend this   Letter   Agreement
to be in compliance with Section 409A. You acknowledge and agree that Interleukin does not guarantee the tax treatment or tax consequences
associated with any payment or benefit arising under this Letter Agreement, including but not limited to consequences related to
Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, this Letter Agreement will be interpreted and at all times administered
in a manner that avoids the inclusion of compensation in income under Section 409A, or the payment of increased taxes, excise taxes
or other penalties under Section 409A.  

(iii)              

If   any payment or benefit   you   would
receive under this Letter Agreement  ,   when combined with
any other payment or benefit you receive pursuant to a Change of Control (for purposes of this section, a  Payment )
would: (A) constitute a    parachute   payment  within
the meaning of Section 280G the Code; and (B) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code (the  Excise Tax ), then such Payment will be either: (X) the full amount of such Payment; or (Y) such lesser amount
(with cash payments being reduced before stock option compensation) as would result in no portion of the Payment being subject
to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local employments
taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in your receipt, on an after-tax basis  , 
 of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be
subject to the Excise Tax.
