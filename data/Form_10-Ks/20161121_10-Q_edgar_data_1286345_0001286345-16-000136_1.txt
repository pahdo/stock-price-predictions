1   NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN   

Nature of Operations and Going Concern     

HPIL Holding (referred to in this report as  HPIL  or
the  Company ) (formerly Trim Holding Group) was incorporated on February 17,
2004 in the state of Delaware under the name TNT Designs, Inc. A substantial
part of the Company s activities were involved in developing a business plan to
market and distribute fashion products.  On June 16, 2009, the majority
interest in the Company was purchased in a private agreement by Mr. Louis
Bertoli, an individual, with the objective to acquire and/or merge with other
businesses. On October 7, 2009, the Company merged with and into Trim Nevada, Inc.,
which became the surviving corporation.  The merger did not result in any
change in the Company s management, assets, liabilities, net worth or location
of principal executive offices. However, this merger changed the legal domicile
of the Company from Delaware to Nevada where Trim Nevada, Inc. was
incorporated.  Each outstanding share of TNT Designs, Inc. was automatically
converted into one share of the common stock of Trim Nevada, Inc. Pursuant to
the merger, the Company changed its name from TNT Designs, Inc. to Trim Holding
Group and announced the change in the Company s business focus to health care
and environmental quality sectors. Afterwards the Company determined it no
longer needed its inactive subsidiaries, and as such, all three subsidiaries
were dissolved. On May 21, 2012, the Company changed its name to HPIL Holding.  

HPIL Holding intends that its main activity will be in
the business of providing consulting services and of investing in differing
business sectors. To begin the implementation of the business plan, on
September 10, 2012, the Company organized six new subsidiary companies. Each of
these subsidiary companies was wholly (100%) owned by the Company. The names of
the new subsidiary companies were HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., HPIL ENERGYTECH Inc.,
HPIL WORLDFOOD Inc., HPIL REAL ESTATE Inc., HPIL GLOBALCOM Inc. and HPIL
ART CULTURE Inc. (collectively, the  Subsidiaries  and, each individually a
 Subsidiary ). These companies were organized to implement the various growth
strategies of the Company.  

On May 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Plan of
Merger (the  Plan of Merger ) with its Subsidiaries in an effort to consolidate
and simplify the Company s operations and accounting practices.  In accordance
with the Plan of Merger, Articles of Merger were completed, executed, and filed
with the Nevada Secretary of State making the merger effective as of May 28,
2015 (the  Merger Effective Date ).  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of
Merger, as of the Merger Effective Date, all shares of each Subsidiary were
canceled and each Subsidiary merged with and into the Company and ceased to
exist, with the Company remaining as the sole surviving entity.  As a result of
the merger, the Company is the successor to all rights and obligations of each
of the Subsidiaries.  The Company does not expect the merger to materially
affect the business plan or the Company s continued pursuit thereof.  

The concentration of the Company has become the
consulting services and the development of products related to the Brand
License Agreement (see Note 6 for further discussion of the Brand License
Agreement), after the disposition of the IFLOR Asset (see Note 3 for further
discussion of the disposition of the IFLOR Asset). As of September 30, 2016,
the Company has yet to commence substantial operations. Expenses incurred
from February 17, 2004 (date of inception) through September 30, 2016, relate
to the Company s formation and general administrative activities. In the course
of its start-up activities, the Company has sustained operating losses and
expects to incur operating losses in 2016. The Company has generated a limited
amount of revenue and has not achieved profitable operations or positive cash
flows from operations.  These factors and uncertainties raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

The Company will continue targeting sources of
additional financing and opportunities to produce profitable revenue streams,
whether through sole or joint ventures, to provide for the continuation of its
operations.  The Company is also prepared to re-evaluate its expense load, if
necessary, to determine whether any efficiency can be achieved prior to the
commencement of substantial operations related to the Brand License Agreement
(Note 6) or other potential operations identified by the Company. 
Additionally, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, who is also the Company s
Corporate Secretary and Treasurer and Director and stockholder, has indicated
his ability to provide financial support to the Company for the continuation of
its operations, should it be necessary (Note 5).  

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation     

4  3  

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United Stated ( GAAP ), and are expressed in United
States dollars.  These condensed consolidated interim financial statements
include the accounts of HPIL Holding and HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., HPIL ENERGYTECH
Inc., HPIL WORLDFOOD Inc., HPIL REAL ESTATE Inc., HPIL GLOBALCOM Inc., and HPIL
ART AND CULTURE Inc. (formerly wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company that
have been merged with and into the Company effective as of May 28, 2015).  All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements     

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual
financial statement and should be read in conjunction with those annual
financial statements filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements reflect adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
shown.  The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year or for any future period.  

Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate     

The equity method of accounting, as prescribed by ASC
Topic 323  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures , is used when a
company is able to exercise significant influence over the entity s operations,
which generally occurs when a company has an ownership interest of between 20%
and 50% in an entity.  The cost method of accounting is used when a company
does not exercise significant influence, generally when a company has an
ownership interest of less than 20%. As of September 17, 2015, the Company s
32% investment in Haesler Real Estate Management SA ( HREM ) was accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. As of September 17, 2015, the carrying
amount of the investment was equal to the Company s equity interest of the
carrying amount of the net assets of HREM. On September 17, 2015, the Company
entered into an Amendment Agreement ( Amendment Agreement ) with Daniel Haesler
( Haesler ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to return 16% of the
outstanding ownership in HREM. As a result of the closing of the Amendment
Agreement, the Company s ownership in HREM was reduced from 32% of the
outstanding ownership of HREM to 16% of the outstanding ownership of HREM. Starting
from September 17, 2015, the Company utilizes the cost method of accounting due
to the fact that HREM is a private company and it is therefore not practicable
to estimate the fair value of the investment.  On November 15, 2015, the
Company entered into a Second Amendment Agreement ( Second Amendment
Agreement ) with Haesler, pursuant to which the Company agreed to return 16% of
the outstanding ownership in HREM.  As a result of the closing of the Second
Amendment Agreement, the Company s ownership in HREM was reduced from 16% of
the outstanding ownership of HREM to 0% of the outstanding ownership of HREM.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets     

The Company follows the ASC 360, which requires that
long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the assets  carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In performing the review for recoverability, if future discounted cash flows
(excluding interest charges) from the use of ultimate disposition of the assets
are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the
difference between its fair value and carrying value, is recognized.   

Research and Development      

The Company is engaged in research and development in
respect to the Company s Brand License Agreement (Note 6) with World
Traditional Fudokan Shotokan Karate-Do Federation, a worldwide karate
federation based in Switzerland ( WTFSKF ), and in respect to the Company s
asset disposed, the IFLOR Asset (Note 3).  Research and development costs are
charged as an operating expense as incurred.    

Revenue Recognition     

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence that an
arrangement or contract exists, delivery has occurred, the fees are fixed and
determinable, and collectability is probable or certain.  Revenue from
consulting services is recognized upon delivery of consulting services when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collection of the related
receivable is reasonably assured.   

Net Loss Per Share     

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average   number of
shares of common stock outstanding for the period and the number of shares of
common stock issuable upon assumed exercise of preferred stock provided the
result is not anti-dilutive.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This new
standard provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of
revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually
all of the current revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.  The standard is
effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.   

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  This
new standard provided guidance for the presentation of the disclosure of
uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  This
standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. 
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its
consolidated financial statements.   

In July 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   Under
this ASU, inventory will be measured at the  lower of cost and net realizable
value  and options that currently exist for  market value  will be eliminated.
The ASU defines net realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the
ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation.  No other changes were made to the current
guidance on inventory measurement. ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard
on its consolidated financial statements.   

In November 2015, the FASB released ASU 2015-17,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU
2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by
deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public companies for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and
early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
any effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements.   

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases. This update will require organizations that lease assets to
recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and
obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require
additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial
statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends
ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. The ASU simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transaction. This
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within that that reporting period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated
financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross vs. Net).  ASU 2016-08 clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 clarified the
implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations.  These ASUs
apple to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods
or services.  There ASUs are effective for public entities for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is
permitted, but not before interim and annual periods beginning after December
16, 2016.  Entities have the choice to apply these ASUs either retrospectively
to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect or
applying these standards at the date of initial application and not adjusting
comparative information.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements.   

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance
Obligation and Licensing, to clarify the identification of performance
obligation as well as the licensing implementation guidance.   

6  5  

In May 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow
Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarifies certain core
recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, and
contract modification, as well as identifies disclosures no longer required if
the full retrospective transition method is adopted.   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments.  The standard provides guidance for eight targeted changes
with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the
statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.
This guidance will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impacts the adoption of this accounting standard will have on the
Company s cash flows.  

None of the other recently issued
accounting pronouncements are expected to significantly affect the Company.  

NOTE 3   CAPITAL STOCK   

The Company entered into a Quota Purchase Agreement
with Haesler on October 26, 2012, pursuant to which the Company acquired from
Haesler 32 quotas of HREM representing 32% of the outstanding ownership in
HREM, in exchange for 350,000 shares of common stock of the Company, which was
valued at $297,500 at the time of the Quota Purchase Agreement. The Company and
Haesler entered into an Amendment Agreement dated September 17, 2015, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to return to Haesler 16 quotas of HREM,
representing 16% of the outstanding ownership in HREM.  In exchange for the 16
quotas of HREM, Haesler agreed to return to the Company 175,000 shares of
common stock of the Company, which was valued at $175,000 at the time of the
Amendment Agreement, based on the trading price of the Company s stock on
September 17, 2015.  The Company returned the quotas to Haesler on September
17, 2015, and Haesler returned the common stock of the Company to the treasury
of the Company on September 22, 2015.  As a result of the closing of the
Amendment Agreement, the Company s ownership in HREM was reduced from 32% of
the outstanding ownership of HREM to 16% of the outstanding ownership of HREM.
The Company recorded a gain of $169,547 on the disposition of its 16% ownership
in HREM included in profit or loss.  The Company and Haesler then entered into
a Second Amendment Agreement dated November 15, 2015, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to return to Haesler 16 quotas of HREM, representing 16% of the
outstanding ownership in HREM.  In exchange for the 16 quotas of HREM, Haesler
agreed to return to the Company 175,000 shares of common stock of the Company,
which was valued at $183,750 at the time
of the Second Amendment Agreement, based on the trading price of the Company s
stock on November 15, 2015.  On December 2, 2015, the Company returned the
quotas to Haesler, and on December 8, 2015, Haesler returned the common stock
of the Company to the treasury of the Company.  As a result of the closing of
the Amendment Agreement, the Company s ownership in HREM was reduced from 16%
of the outstanding ownership of HREM to 0% of the outstanding ownership of
HREM.   

The Company entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale
Agreement (the  Asset Agreement ) with GIOTOS Limited, a private limited
company organized in the United Kingdom ( GIOTOS ) on December 9, 2015.
Pursuant to the Asset Agreement, the Company sold, assigned, conveyed and
delivered certain patent rights and other related business processes and
know-how related to the IFLOR Device (collectively, the  IFLOR Business ) and
the patents, inventory and equipment related to the IFLOR Business
(collectively, the  Additional IFLOR Business  the Additional IFLOR Business
together with the IFLOR Business and Intellectual Property, the  IFLOR Asset )
to GIOTOS, in consideration for 10,040,000 shares of the Company common stock
(the  Purchase Price ) transferred from GIOTOS to the Company.  The portion of
the Purchase Price allocated as consideration for the IFLOR Business was
9,615,500 shares, and the portion of the Purchase Price allocated as
consideration for the Additional IFLOR Business was 424,500 shares.  The Asset
Agreement was closed on December 9, 2015, at which time, pursuant to the Asset
Agreement, the Company executed and delivered an assignment of the IFLOR Asset
to GIOTOS, and GIOTOS transferred the full amount of the Purchase Price to the
Company and completed the cancellation of the shares composing the Purchase
Price on December 16, 2015. Immediately prior to the transaction consummated by
the Asset Agreement, GIOTOS owned 50,000,000 shares of the Company common
stock. Additionally, GIOTOS is majority owned and operated by Louis Bertoli,
who is the Company s Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief
Executive Officer. As Louis Bertoli is majority owner of GIOTOS the transfer of
the IFLOR Business and the Additional IFLOR Business represents a common
control transaction and therefore the 10,040,000 shares received as
consideration have been valued at $527,851, based on the carrying value of the
equipment, inventory and patents given up.   

The Company filed an amendment with the Secretary of
State of Nevada on April 19, 2016, amending its Articles of Incorporation,
Article IV - Capital Stock. The effect of the amendment was to cancel all
100,000,000 shares of the Company s authorized preferred stock ( Preferred
Stock ), consisting of 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $8.75
per share; and 75,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $7 per share. 
The amendment was effective as of April 18, 2016, at which time there were no
shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.  Following the amendment, the

Overview   

(a)  

Business Background.   

HPIL Holding
( we ,  us ,  our , or the  Company ) is an early stage company originally
incorporated on February 17, 2004 in the state of Delaware under the name TNT
Designs, Inc  .  On October 7, 2009, we
merged with and into Trim Nevada, Inc., a Nevada corporation, for the purpose
of changing our domicile from Delaware to Nevada. As part of the merger, we
changed our name to Trim Holding Group.  On May 22, 2012, we changed our name
to HPIL Holding to more fully reflect our current business operations.  

On July 18, 2012, the Company
changed its business plan to focus on making investments in companies, whether
public or private enterprises, in differing business sectors.  This business plan
continues to be a focus of the Company today. The Company does not restrict the
target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location
and thus seeks to acquire a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company
evaluates the acquisition of intellectual properties and technologies for
investment, with a particular interest in the healthcare and environmental
quality sectors.  Such investments may be made in the United States and
worldwide.

On
September 10, 2012, the Company organized six new subsidiary companies. Each of
these subsidiary companies was wholly owned (100%) by the Company.  The names
of the new subsidiary companies were HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., HPIL ENERGYTECH
Inc., HPIL WORLDFOOD Inc., HPIL REAL ESTATE Inc., HPIL GLOBALCOM Inc. and ART CULTURE
Inc. These companies were organized with the intention of satisfying the

2013, the Company granted to HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. an exclusive license to use
the patents relating to the  Massage Vibrator for the Relief of Aches and Pain

ownership of HREM to 16% of the outstanding ownership of HREM.  On November 15,
2015, the Company and Haesler entered into a Second Amendment Agreement,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to return to Haesler 16 quotas of HREM,
representing 16% of the outstanding ownership in HREM.  In exchange for the 16
quotas of HREM, Haesler agreed to return to the Company 175,000 shares of
common stock of the Company, which was valued at $183,750 at the time of the
Second Amendment Agreement, based on the trading price of the Company s stock
on November 15, 2015.  On December 2, 2015, the Company returned the quotas to
Haesler, and on December 8, 2015, Haesler returned the common stock of the
Company to the treasury of the Company. As a result of the closing of the
Second Amendment Agreement, the Company s ownership in HREM was reduced from
16% of the outstanding ownership of HREM to 0% of the outstanding ownership of
HREM.  The preceding descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, the First
Amendment Agreement, and the Second Amendment Agreement are incomplete and

On December 5, 2015, the Company entered into a Mutual
Termination Agreement (the  Mutual Termination Agreement ) with WTFSKF.
Pursuant to the Mutual Termination Agreement, the parties terminated a certain
Product Reseller Agreement (the  Product Reseller Agreement ) entered into
between HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. and WTSKF on October 9, 2014, pursuant to which,
beginning in 2017, HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. was to supply its IFLOR Stimulating
Massage Device - Standard Version to WTFSKF for resale exclusively at
WTFSKF-sanctioned events and through the WTFSKF members and their official
affiliates.  The termination of the Product Reseller Agreement was mutual,
without recourse or the incurrence of penalty by either party thereto, and
effective on December 5, 2015.  HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., formerly a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, was merged with and into the Company effective as of
May 28, 2015, as a result of which the Company succeeded to and assumed all
rights and obligations of HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., including those arising from
the Product Reseller Agreement. The preceding descriptions of the Mutual
Termination Agreement and Product Reseller Agreement are incomplete and
qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the Mutual
Termination Agreement and Product Reseller Agreement, respectively, which were
included as exhibits to previously filed Current Reports of the Company on Form
8-K on December 9, 2015.  

On December 9, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset
Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Asset Agreement ) with GIOTOS Limited, a
private limited company organized in the United Kingdom ( GIOTOS ). Pursuant to
the Asset Agreement, the Company sold, assigned, conveyed and delivered certain
patent rights and other related business processes and know-how related to the
IFLOR Device (collectively, the  IFLOR Business ) and certain additional assets
related to the IFLOR Business (collectively, the  Additional IFLOR Business 
the Additional IFLOR Business together with the IFLOR Business and Intellectual
Property, the  IFLOR Asset ) to GIOTOS, in consideration for 10,040,000 shares
of the Company common stock (the  Purchase Price ) transferred from GIOTOS to
the Company.  The portion of the Purchase Price allocated as consideration for
the IFLOR Business was 9,615,500 shares, and the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated as consideration for the Additional IFLOR Business was 424,500
shares.  The Asset Agreement was closed on December 9, 2015, at which time,
pursuant to the Asset Agreement, the Company executed and delivered an
assignment of the IFLOR Asset to GIOTOS, and GIOTOS transferred the full amount
of the Purchase Price to the Company and complete cancellation of the shares composing
the Purchase Price on December 16, 2015. Immediately prior to the transaction
consummated by the Asset Agreement, GIOTOS owned 50,000,000 shares of the
Company common stock. Additionally, GIOTOS is majority owned and operated by
Louis Bertoli, who is the Company s Chairman of the Board and the President and
Chief Executive Officer. As of the date of the Asset Agreement, the shares of
the company common stock were quoted at $1.30 per share (the  Current Stock
Price ), making the total value of the Purchase Price equal to $13,052,000. The
Company determined the amount of the Purchase Price by adding the fair value of
the IFLOR Business as of the date was acquired by the Company in 2012
($12,500,000), as determined by a third-party valuation of the IFLOR Business
conducted in 2013 divided by the Current Stock Price, plus the total amount of
funds actually expended by the Company in developing the Additional IFLOR
Assets ($551,850) divided by the Current Stock Price (the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to each of the IFLOR Business and Additional IFLOR
Assets was determined in the same manner). Mr. Bertoli, as an interested
director, did not participate in the approval of the Asset Agreement and the
Purchase Price by the Board of Directors of the Company.  The foregoing summary
of the Asset Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the Asset Agreement, which was filed as an
exhibit to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K on December 14, 2015.

Material Transactions
  and Other Significant Business Transactions Overview.   

The Company did not enter in any transactions that it
considers material or otherwise significant during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

13  12  

(d)  

Business of Issuer.   

HPIL Holding is a worldwide holding company. The
Company is focused on investing in both private and public companies in
differing business sectors. The Company does not restrict its potential
candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, acquires various types of business. Also, the Company
evaluates intellectual properties and technologies for potential acquisition,
with a particular interest in the healthcare and environmental quality sectors.  

During 2015, we terminated various cooperation
agreements and the Product Reseller Agreement and divested several of our
existing investments, including the IFLOR Asset (as discussed in section (b) of
this Item above).  We made these changes to reduce overall expenses related to
these agreements and investments and sharpen the focus of our efforts on
developing the Brand License Agreement and identifying and vetting potential
alternative investments in an effort to increase the efficiency of deploying
our resources.  The Company intends to continue to pursue its business plan of
making investments in companies and intellectual properties and providing
consulting service, and expects that it will continue on that business plan for
the foreseeable future.  While the Company is not currently actively marketing
any services or products, it will continue on its business plan of actively
seeking investment opportunities for the foreseeable future.  Our ability to
execute the current business plan may be adversely affected by a number of
factors, some of which may include:  

our inability to identify
potential investment opportunities;  

our inability to finance such
investments on terms we believe are favorable to the Company;  

our inability to negotiate
acceptable or favorable terms for investment in identified opportunities;  

our inability to adequately or
accurately identify potential liability exposure and other risks related to
investment opportunities;  

our inability to effectively
manage and incorporate new investments opportunities into the Company;  

changes in the current business
plan, as set forth above, based on our strategic market studies and evaluations
or other currently unknown factors; or  

other factors, within or outside
of our control, that may affect our ability to execute our business plan in an
efficient manner, including, without limitation, acts of God, changes in
applicable laws, or inability to engage the necessary or strategic business
partners on satisfactory terms.  

Moreover, the Company will continue to concentrate on
the development of the Brand License Agreement (see section (b) of this Item above)
until it will commence in 2018.  While the Company is still in the conceptual
stages of the line of business that may be developed under the Brand License Agreement,
we intend to explore potential manufacturing, distribution, and other strategic
partnerships in connection with the Brand License Agreement.  Additionally,
over the next approximately 11 months, we intend to take additional steps
necessary to bring the Product to market in a timely fashion, chiefly among
them:    

evaluate market demand for the
Product, not only among WTFSKF members and fans, but possibly even beyond, and
create marketing and sales strategies around the Product to reach our target
consumer groups based on these evaluations;  

evaluate and engage designers to
develop Product concepts and designs consistent with the target consumer; and  

evaluate manufacturing and supply
chain options to efficiently bring branded Product to various markets
throughout the world.  

Our ability to develop a successful line of business
with respect to the Brand License Agreement and related Products may be
adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which may include:  

our inability to adequately or accurately
generate or measure demand in the market for the Products;  

our inability to create or execute
effective marketing and sales strategies around the Product to reach consumers
and/or generate interest in and orders for the Product;  

our inability to engage designers
or develop Product concepts that are economical and appeal to the consumer;  

our inability to achieve efficient
manufacturing, supply chain, and/or distribution channels;  

changes in the current business
plan, as set forth above, based on our strategic market studies and evaluations
or other currently unknown factors;  

inadequate protection of the
logos, names, and marks of WTFSKF that are licensed under the Brand License
Agreement; or  

other factors that may affect our
ability to reach necessary production, supply, and/or distribution capacity in
an efficient manner, including, without limitation, acts of God, changes in
labor laws, work stoppages, or inability to engage the necessary or strategic business
partners on satisfactory terms.  

14  13  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We are an early stage
company focused on developing our business of evaluating for potential
investment or acquisition both private and public companies and intellectual
properties and technologies in differing business sectors, including, without
limitation Healthcare, Environmental Quality, Energy and Real Estate.  Our
principal business objective for the next twelve (12) months will be to
continue to develop our business plan of investing and providing related
consulting services in these sectors, continue efforts to begin market and
design evaluations of the Products related to the Brand License Agreement (as
discussed   in Item 2, sections (b) and (d)
above)  .  During
2015, we terminated many of our underperforming agreements and investments to
reduce the strain on our resources and redirect those resources to identifying
and developing more promising investments.  As we have commenced only limited
operations and have yet to reach full operations, particularly with respect to
our current principal business objective, currently the Products related to the
Brand License Agreement, we have not earned substantial revenues to date other
than those revenues generated from two (2) consulting arrangements entered into
during 2014, both of which were terminated in the first quarter of 2015.  

Net cash (used in) operating activities.     During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash used
in operating activities was $(46,562) compared with $(414,925) used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The cash flow used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 was primarily the result of incurred operating expenses
without sufficient current revenue generating a net loss.  

Investing activities   .    The
Company did not engage in any activities generating or using cash flow that it
classified as investing activities   during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
and 2015.  

Net cash provided by financing activities.     During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, net cash
provided by financing activities was $41,700 compared with $Nil provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  The cash flow
provided by financing activities in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, was
primarily the result of proceeds from advances from stockholder and advances
from officer. The Company did not engage in any activities generating or using cash
flow that it classified as financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

In the course of its start-up activities, the Company
has sustained operating losses and expects to incur an operating loss for the
foreseeable future.  Expenses incurred from February 17, 2004, (date of
inception) through September 30, 2016, relate primarily to the Company s formation and
general administrative activities.  The Company has generated a limited amount
of revenue and has not achieved profitable operations or positive cash flows
from operations. These factors and uncertainties raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the report of the Company's independent
registered public accounting firm on the Company s consolidated financial
statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 contained
an emphasis of a matter paragraph stating this uncertainty. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements accompanying this Quarterly Report have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern.  

During 2014, the Company entered into two   (2)   consulting agreements that
provided a revenue stream of $35,000 per month.  The consulting agreements have
since been mutually terminated by the Company and the counterparties thereto
due to lack of ongoing need for the consulting services that were to be rendered
under the agreements, allowing the Company to focus our full energy and effort
on continuing to develop our core business plan and evaluating additional
investment and acquisition opportunities.  Also during 2014, we entered into
two   (2)   long term
agreements with WTFSKF: the Brand License Agreement and the Product Reseller
Agreement (each discussed in Item 2, section (b) above).  We expect to begin
generating revenue from the Brand License Agreement during 2018.  The Product
Reseller Agreement was mutually terminated on December 5, 2015 (discussed in Item
2, section (b) above).  The Company had negative working capital of   $80,271   as
of September 30, 2016.  

The Company will continue targeting sources of
additional financing and opportunities to produce profitable revenue streams,
whether through sole or joint ventures, to provide continuation of its
operations.  Additionally, during the latter half of its fiscal year 2015, the
Company took steps to significantly reduce its expense load moving forward and is
prepared to continue evaluating its expense load, if necessary, to determine
whether any efficiency can be achieved prior to generation of revenues
sufficient to support increased operations.  Management believes the Company
will be successful in achieving either additional financing or one or more
additional revenue streams to support the continuation of its operations
through September 30, 2017.  Moreover, the
Company s Chief Financial Officer, who is also the Company s Corporate
Secretary and Treasurer and a Director and stockholder, has indicated his
ability to provide financial support to the Company, should it be necessary. 
Despite the aforementioned developments in the Company s financial standing,
there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve revenues sufficient to
become profitable or that the Company will be able to continue to raise funds,
in which case we may be unable to meet our obligations and we may cease
operations.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Results
of Operations   

As the Company is an early stage company, it has
commenced only limited operations and has yet to reach full operations;
therefore, the Company has little operations to report at this time.  The
Company s main focus has been on the development of its business plan.  Aside
from the execution of the two (2) consulting agreements during 2014 (both of
which were terminated during the first quarter of 2015), and the Product
Reseller Agreement (which was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2015),
and entering into the Brand License Agreement, pursuant to which the Company
has acquired a license to use certain logos, names, and marks of WTFSKF for commercial
sales of certain Product (clothing, accessories and certain sporting goods)
beginning in January of 2018, the Company has made no sales nor generated
additional revenue and all expenses to date have related to the development of
its business plan and other expenses related to the daily operations of a
public company and beginning stages of business activities related to the
Product and the IFLOR Asset (which the Company sold, as discussed in Item 2,
section (b) above).  

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015.    

General
and Administrative Expenses.     General and administrative expenses decreased
to $41,594 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $58,989 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative
expenses is primarily related to     increased expense efficiency resulting in lower professional fees and lower service and
technical support  .   

Research
and Development Costs.     Research and development costs decreased to $Nil for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $6,032 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in research and development costs is
primarily related to a decrease in research and development costs for the
Company s former IFLOR Asset.  

Disposition
of Unconsolidated Affiliate.     Disposition of unconsolidated affiliate
decreased to $Nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $169,547
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decreased in disposition of
unconsolidated affiliate is primarily related to the gain recorded in
connection with the Company s disposition of 16 quotas in HREM during the three
months ended September 30, 2015 (see subsection (b) of Item 2 for additional
information regarding this transaction).  

Net Income/(Loss).    
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $(41,594)
as compared to a net income of $104,526 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily
a result of expenses incurred without generating sufficient revenue.  The variance
in net income/(loss) over the periods was primarily the result of the one-time gain
recorded in connection with the Company s disposition of interest in an
unconsolidated affiliated during the three months ended September 30, 2015,
partially offset by a reduction in expenses from $65,021 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, to $41,594 for the three months ended September 30,
2016, due   to increased expense
efficiency  .   

Comparison of Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015.    

Consulting Revenue.     Consulting revenue decreased to $Nil for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from $35,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease
in consulting revenue is primarily related to the termination of consulting
agreements during the first quarter of 2015 resulting in the cessation of
revenues previously realized from those agreements.  

General
and Administrative Expenses.     General and administrative expenses decreased
to $77,111 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $417,841 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in general and administrative
expenses is primarily related to     increased expense efficiency resulting in lower professional fees and lower service and
technical support  .   

Research and Development Costs   .  Research and development costs decreased to $Nil for nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $48,581 for nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease
in research and development costs is primarily related to a decrease in
research and development costs for the Company s Brand License Agreement with
WTFSKF and related to our former IFLOR Asset.  

Equity
Losses in Unconsolidated Affiliate.     Equity losses in unconsolidated affiliate
decreased to $Nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $5,027 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in equity losses in
unconsolidated affiliate is primarily related to the Company s divesting of its
ownership in the affiliate during 2015. The equity losses in unconsolidated
affiliate recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, represents the
Company s proportionate shares of the affiliate s losses during that period,
prior to when the Company began divesting its ownership of the affiliate and
ceased to have significant influence over the affiliate (which began about
September 17, 2015, as discussed in Item 2, section (b) above).  

16  15  

Disposition
of Unconsolidated Affiliate.     Disposition of unconsolidated affiliate
decreased to $Nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $169,547
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decreased in disposition of
unconsolidated affiliate is primarily related to the gain recorded in
connection with the Company s disposition of 16 quotas in HREM during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 (see subsection (b) of Item 2 for additional
information regarding this transaction).  

Net     Loss   .  For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $(77,111) as compared to a
net loss of $(266,902) for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, was primarily a
result of expenses incurred without generating sufficient revenue.  The
decrease in net loss was primarily a result of   decreased total expenses due to increased expense
efficiency partially offset by decreased consulting revenue due to the
termination of consulting agreements during the   first quarter of 2015 resulting in the cessation of
revenues previously realized from those agreements, and the one-time
gain recorded in connection with the
Company s disposition of interest in an unconsolidated affiliated during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in total
expenses from $471,449 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $77,111
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily a result of
decreases in accounting-related and professional fees and research and
development costs related to the Company s Brand License Agreement with WTFSKF
and related to our former IFLOR Asset.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources and would be considered material to investors.  

Inflation   

We do not believe that inflation has had in the past
or will have in the future any significant negative impact on our operations.  

Item 3.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

As we are a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

(a)   

Evaluation of disclosure
  controls and procedures   .   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) that are designed to assure that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as
of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective as of the
date of filing this Form 10-Q due to limited accounting and reporting personnel
and a lack of segregation of duties due to limited financial resources and the
size of our Company.  We will need to adopt additional disclosure controls and
procedures prior to commencement of material operations. Consistent therewith,
on an on-going basis we will evaluate the adequacy of our controls and
procedures.  

Management is committed to improving its internal
controls and will continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls
in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance
responsibilities.  At this time, however, management has not established a time
table for when it intends to address the aforementioned material weaknesses.  

(b)   

Changes in internal
  control over financial reporting   .   

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  

PART II---OTHER INFORMATION

industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.

2.  

Based
  on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a

4.  

The
  registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for disclosure

  have:  

(a)  

Designed
  such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls
  and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
  information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
  subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
  particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  

(b)  

Designed
  such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal

  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  

(c)  

Evaluated
  the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and

  in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial
  reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter
  (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
  has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
  registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  

5.  

The
  registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our
  most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
  registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of
  directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)  

All
  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
  of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
  adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and
  report financial information; and  

(b)  

Any
  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
  who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over
  financial reporting.
