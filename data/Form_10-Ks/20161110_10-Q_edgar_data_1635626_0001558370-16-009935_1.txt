Note 1.  Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Equitable Financial Corp. (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary Equitable Bank (the  Bank ) have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, the statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that were included in the Company s annual report for the year ended June 30, 2016.  The consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the company as of that date.  All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments necessary (i) for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods included herein and (ii) to make such financial statements not misleading have been made and are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  For further information with respect to significant accounting policies followed by the Company in preparation of the financial statements, refer to the Company s annual report for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) system. The Bank maintains insurance on deposit accounts with the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).   

Note 2.  Stock Conversion 

On July 8, 2015, Equitable Financial, MHC, the Company s former federally chartered mutual holding company, consummated its mutual-to-stock conversion, and the Company consummated its initial stock offering. In the Offering, the Company sold 1,983,160 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at $8.00 per share in a subscription offering and community offering, including 118,989 shares, equal to 6.0% of the shares sold in the offering, to the Equitable Bank employee stock ownership plan. 

In accordance with applicable federal conversion regulations, at the time of the completion of our mutual-to-stock conversion, we established a liquidation account in an amount equal to the Company s total equity as of the latest balance sheet date in the final prospectus used in the Conversion. Each eligible account holder or supplemental account holder is entitled to a proportionate share of this liquidation account in the event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event. This share will be reduced if the eligible account holder s or supplemental account holder s deposit balance falls below the amounts on the date of record as of any June 30 and will cease to exist if the account is closed. The liquidation account will never be increased despite any increase after Conversion in the related deposit balance. 

Following completion of the Conversion, the Bank may not declare, pay a dividend on, or repurchase any of its capital stock of the Bank, if the effect thereof would cause retained earnings to be reduced below the liquidation account amount or regulatory capital requirements. 

Note 3.  New Accounting Pronouncements 

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU is effective for the Company with the interim period beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect of this proposal to our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The purpose of this Update is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The purpose of this Update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity. The Update replaces the current incurred loss methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This ASU is expected to have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this will have on its financial statements.    

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows; Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The purpose of this Update is to address existing diversity in practice related to specific cash flow issues.  This Update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Note 4.  Securities 

The fair value of securities available-for-sale and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: 

The carrying amount, unrecognized gross gains and losses, and fair value of securities held-to-maturity are as follows: 

10 

Table of Contents  

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity consist of investments in bonds securitized by the Government National Mortgage Association and local municipal securities. 

The contractual maturities of the residential mortgage-backed securities at September 30, 2016 are not disclosed because the securities are not due at a single maturity date.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Approximately $400,000 in municipal securities will mature in the year ending June 30, 2019 with the remaining balance maturing in the year ending June 30, 2020. 

There were no sales of securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The duration of gross unrealized losses is not disclosed as such amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not recognized other-than-temporary impairment on any securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 5.  Loans 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, less an allowance for loan losses, premiums and discounts on loans purchased, and net deferred loan fees/costs. Interest income on loans is recognized over the term of the loan and is calculated using the simple interest method on principal amounts outstanding. Direct loan origination fees and costs are generally being deferred and the net amounts amortized as an adjustment of the related loan's yield. The Company generally amortizes these amounts over the contractual life. Direct loan origination fees and costs related to loans sold to unrelated third parties are recognized as income or expense in the current consolidated statement of income. 

The Company s portfolio segments are as follows: 

Commercial     

Agricultural      

Residential real estate

Loans are as follows: 

For all portfolio segments, the allowance for loan losses is maintained at the level considered adequate by management of the Company to provide for losses that are probable. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to operating expense and reduced by net charge-offs. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. In determining the adequacy of the allowance balance, the Company makes continuous evaluations of the loan portfolio and related off-balance sheet commitments, considers current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, review of specific problem loans and other factors. 

Changes in the allowance for loan losses, by portfolio segment are summarized as follows: 

For commercial loans and agricultural loans, the allowance for estimated losses on loans consists of specific and general components.  

12 

Table of Contents  

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired, as defined below. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  

For commercial loans and agricultural loans, a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a case-by-case basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  

The general component consists of quantitative and qualitative factors and covers non-impaired loans. The quantitative factors are based on historical charge-off experience. The qualitative factors are determined based on an assessment of internal and/or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data. The Company s credit quality indicator for all loans excluding commercial loans is past due or performance status.  The Company s credit quality indicator for commercial loans is internal risk ratings. 

For residential real estate loans and consumer and other loans, these large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. In estimating the allowance for loan losses for these loans, the Company applies quantitative and qualitative factors on a portfolio segment basis. Quantitative factors are based on historical charge-off experience and qualitative factors are based on an assessment of internal and/or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data. Accordingly, the Company generally does not separately identify individual residential real estate loans and/or consumer loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower.  

Troubled debt restructures are considered impaired loans and are subject to the same allowance methodology as described above for impaired loans by portfolio segment. 

The allowance for loan losses, by impairment evaluation and portfolio segment is summarized as follows: 

13 

Table of Contents  

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Generally, for all classes of loans, loans are considered past due when contractual payments are delinquent for 31 days or greater.  

For all classes of loans, loans will generally be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan has become greater than 90 days past due; or when management believes, after considering collection efforts and other factors, that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. 

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, payments received will be applied to the principal balance. However, interest may be taken on a cash basis in the event the loan is fully secured and the risk of loss is minimal.  Previously recorded but uncollected interest on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is accounted for as follows:  if the previously accrued but uncollected interest and the principal amount of the loan is protected by sound collateral value based upon a current, independent qualified appraisal, such interest may remain on the Company s books. If such interest is not so protected, it is considered a loss with the amount thereof recorded in the current year being reversed against current interest income, and the amount recorded in the prior year being charged against the allowance for possible loan losses. 

For all classes of loans, nonaccrual loans may be restored to accrual status provided the following criteria are met: 

The loan is current, and all principal and interest amounts contractually due have been made     

The loan is well secured and in the process of collection     

Prospects for future principal and interest payments are not in doubt     

The aging in terms of unpaid principal balance of the loan portfolio, by classes of loans is summarized as follows:

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

For commercial, agriculture, and construction and land loans, the Company utilizes the following internal risk rating scale: 

Highest Quality (rating 1) -- Loans represent a credit extension of the highest quality. Excellent liquidity, management and character in an industry with favorable conditions. High quality financial information, history of strong cash flows and superior collateral including readily marketable assets, prime real estate, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agencies, highly rated municipal bonds, insured savings accounts, and insured certificates of deposit drawn on high-quality financial institutions. 

Good Quality (rating 2) -- Loans which have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment. Strong to good liquidity, management and character in an industry with favorable conditions. Good quality financial information and margins of cash flow coverage is consistently good. Loans may be unsecured, secured by quality (but less readily marketable) assets, high quality real estate or traded stocks, lower grade municipal bonds (which must still be investment grade), and uninsured certificates of deposit on other financial institutions may also be included in this grade. 

Acceptable Quality (rating 3) -- Loans where the borrower is a reasonable credit risk and demonstrates the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations. Good liquidity, management and character in an industry that is more sensitive to external factors. Alternative sources of refinancing may be less available in periods of uncertain economic conditions. Term debt is moderate but cash flow margins fall within bank policy guidelines. Quality of financial information is adequate but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher-grade loans. Secured by business assets that conform to usual lending parameters for margin and eligibility or real estate that is deemed to be of satisfactory quality in an area that may not be prime but still within viable economic centers. 

Fair Quality (rating 4) -- Loans where the borrower is a reasonable credit risk but shows a more erratic earnings history (a loss may have been realized in the past four years). Liquidity is limited and primary repayment is susceptible to unfavorable external factors. Industry characteristics are generally stable. Borrower is more highly leveraged with increased levels of term debt. Cash flow margins remain adequate but may not fall within the policy guidelines. Quality of financial information is adequate and interim reporting may be required. Secured by business assets with an adequate collateral margin or real estate that is of fair quality and location. Property may have limited alternative uses and may be considered a "special use" facility. 

Special Mention (rating 5) -- Loans in this category have the potential for developing weaknesses that deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel. If the developing weakness is not corrected or mitigated, the ability of the borrower to repay the Company's debt in the future may deteriorate. This grade should not be   

15 

Table of Contents  

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

assigned to loans that bear certain peculiar risks normally associated with the type of financing involved, unless circumstances have caused the risk to increase to a level higher than would have been acceptable when the credit was originally approved. If a loan's actual, not potential, weakness or problems are clearly evident and significant it should generally be graded in one of the following grade categories. 

Substandard (rating 6) -- Loans and other credit extensions are considered to be inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. These loans, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual loans classified substandard. 

Doubtful (rating 7) -- Loans and other credit extensions have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded "6" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include: proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation actions; capital injection; perfecting liens on collateral and refinancing plans. Loans in this classification should be placed in non-accrual status, with collections applied to principal. 

Loss (rating 8) -- Loans are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of the Bank. This classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value. However, it is not prudent to delay writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future. 

For commercial, agricultural and construction and loan loans or credit relationships with aggregate exposure greater than $250,000, a loan review is required within 12 months of the most recent credit review. The reviews are completed in enough detail to, at a minimum, validate the risk rating. Additionally, the reviews shall determine whether any documentation exceptions exist, appropriate written analysis is included in the loan file, and whether credit policies have been properly adhered to. 

For each class of loans, the following summarizes the unpaid principal balance by credit quality indicator as of:

Table of Contents  

Equitable Financial Corp. and Subsidiary 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

*  Performing loans are those which are accruing and less than 31 days past due. Nonperforming loans are those on nonaccrual and accruing loans that are greater than or equal to 31 days past due. 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had no loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing. 

For commercial, agricultural, and construction and land loans, the Company s credit quality indicator is internally assigned risk ratings. Each loan is assigned a risk rating upon origination. The risk rating is reviewed every 12 months, at a minimum, and on an as needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan. 

For residential real estate and consumer loans, the Company s credit quality indicator is performance determined by delinquency status. Delinquency status is updated daily by the Company s loan system.

Note 6.  Regulatory Matters 

The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory   and possibly additional discretionary   actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

The prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition.  If only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits.  If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and plans for capital restoration are required.  Management believes, as of September 30, 2016, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

Actual capital levels and minimum required levels for the Bank were: 

Federal regulations require the Bank to comply with a Qualified Thrift Lender ( QTL ) test, which requires that 65% of assets be maintained in housing-related finance and other specified assets.  If the QTL test is not met, limits are placed on growth, branching, new investment, FHLB advances, and dividends or the institution must convert to a commercial bank charter.  Management believes the QTL test has been met. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes. The rules revised minimum capital requirements and adjusted prompt corrective action thresholds. The final rules revised the regulatory capital elements, added a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement, and implemented a new capital conservation buffer. The rules also permitted certain banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income. Management chose the one-time election to retain the existing treatment. The final rules took effect for community banks on January 1, 2015, subject to a transition period for certain parts of the rules.

Note 7.      Employee Benefit Plan 

The Company has a 401(k) and profit sharing plan (the  Plans ) covering substantially all employees.  Annual contributions to the Plans are made at the discretion of and determined by the Board of Directors.  Participant interests are vested over a period from one to five years of service.  Contributions were made of $29,699 and $27,955 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

On November 8, 2005, the Company adopted an employee stock ownership plan (the  ESOP ) for the benefit of substantially all employees.  The ESOP borrowed $1,292,620 from the Company and used those funds to acquire 129,262 shares of the Company s stock in connection with the reorganization at a price of $10.00 per share. 

On July 8, 2015, the ESOP borrowed $951,912 from the Company and used the funds to acquire 118,989 shares of the Company s stock in connection with the stock offering at a price of $8.00 per share. 

Shares purchased by the ESOP with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account and are allocated to ESOP participants on a pro rata basis as principal and interest payments are made by the ESOP to the Company.  The loan is secured by shares purchased with the loan proceeds and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from the Company s discretionary contributions to the ESOP and earnings on ESOP assets.  Annual principal and interest payments from the note dated November 8, 2005 are approximately $145,000 until maturity at December 31, 2019.  Annual principal and interest payments from the note dated July 8, 2015 are approximately $65,000 until maturity at July 8, 2035. 

As shares are released from collateral, the Company will report compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares and the shares will become outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.  Dividends on allocated ESOP shares reduce retained earnings; dividends on unearned ESOP shares reduce accrued interest.  Because participants may require the Company to purchase their ESOP shares upon termination of their employment, the fair value of all earned and allocated ESOP shares may become a liability. 

The ESOP has a plan year-end of December 31.  The Company recorded compensation expense of $34,240 and $18,698 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Shares held by the ESOP were as follows: 

The Company approved the Equitable Financial Corp. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan in November 2006 which provides for awards of stock options and restricted stock to officers, employees and directors.  The cost of the plan is based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date.  The fair value of stock is based on the closing price of the Company s stock on the grant date.  The cost of the awards are being recognized over the five-year vesting periods during which participants are required to provide services in exchange for the awards. 

The maximum number of shares authorized under the plan is 176,297 stock options and 70,519 shares of restricted stock to employees and directors. The number of shares has been adjusted for the conversion ratio taking effect in July 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 no stock options have been awarded.

Restricted stock awards are accounted for as fixed grants using the fair value of the Company s stock at the time of the grant.  Unvested restricted stock awards may not be disposed of or transferred during the vesting period.  Restricted stock awards carry with them the right to receive dividends. 

The table below represents the restricted stock award activity for the period shown: 

Note 8.      Earnings per Share 

Amounts reported in earnings per share reflect earnings available to common stockholders for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings available to common stockholders for the period by the sum of the weighted average common shares outstanding and the weighted average dilutive shares.

Note 9.      Fair Value Measurements 

The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure of fair value measurements.  The fair value hierarchy set forth in the Topic is as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended September 30, 2016, nor were there any changes in valuation techniques used for assets or liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2016. 

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  : A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below: 

Securities Available-for-Sale     Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow. Level 2 securities would include U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed agency securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and certain corporate, asset backed and other securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 

The following tables summarize assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  :  A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 

Impaired Loans     From time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for credit losses is established.  The specific reserves for collateral dependent impaired loans are based on the fair value of the collateral   

24 

Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of collateral was determined based on appraisals. In some cases, adjustments were made to the appraised values due to various factors including age of the appraisal, age of comparables included in the appraisal, and known changes in the market and in the collateral.  When significant adjustments were based on unobservable inputs, the resulting fair value measurement has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. 

Foreclosed Assets     Foreclosed assets are carried at estimated fair value of the property, less disposal costs.  The fair value of the property is determined based upon appraisals.  As with impaired loans, if significant adjustments are made to the appraised value, based on unobservable inputs, the resulting fair value measurement has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 the fair value of impaired loans and foreclosed assets were immaterial. 

The Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value.  Fair value is determined under the framework discussed above.  The Topic excludes all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.  The following methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value disclosure for financial instruments are described below: 

Cash and due from financial institutions     For cash and due from financial institutions, the current carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Interest-earning deposits     For interest-earning deposits, the current carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Securities     The fair value of securities is determined using quoted prices, when available in an active market.  If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or a discounted cash flows model. 

Federal Home Loan Bank stock     For restricted equity securities, the carrying value approximates fair value. 

Loans, net     The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  The fair value of variable rate loans approximates carrying value. 

Deposits     The carrying value of noninterest-bearing deposits approximates fair value.  The fair value of fixed rate deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates for the same remaining maturities. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase     For federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the carrying value approximates fair value.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 the Company did not have any federal funds purchased or securities sold under agreements to repurchase; however from time to time the Company will. 

Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings     The estimated fair value of fixed rate advances from the FHLB is determined by discounting the future cash flows of existing advances using rates currently available on advances from the FHLB having similar characteristics.  Adjustable rate advances  carrying value approximates fair value.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 the Company did not have any Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings; however from time to time the Company will. 

Accrued interest     The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value.

Overview 

We are a   Nebraska-based community bank headquartered in Grand Island, Nebraska, with full-service branch offices in Grand Island, Omaha and North Platte, Nebraska.  For most of our history as a community bank, which dates back to 1882, we have operated as a traditional thrift institution, focusing on the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans.  In the past 10 years, however, we have expanded our lending focus and now offer a wide range of loans to commercial businesses, agricultural borrowers and consumers   in addition to our traditional residential loan products.  We also invest in securities, primarily U.S. government agency securities, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.  In addition, we offer insurance and investment products and services from locations in Grand Island, Omaha and North Platte. 

Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income.  Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.  Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.  Non-interest income currently consists primarily of service fees, rental income, gain on sales of loans and other income.  Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing, advertising and promotion, professional and regulatory, federal deposit insurance premiums, net loss on other real estate owned, write-downs, sales and other operating expenses.  Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ) was signed into law.  The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies.  As an  emerging growth company  we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.  We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.  Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

Discussed below are selected critical accounting policies that are of particular significance to us: 

Allowance for Loan Losses.    The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a     quarterly basis.  When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.  An allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered necessary to provide for loan losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio.  In determining the allowance for loan losses, we consider the losses inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of the loan activities, along with the local economic and real estate market conditions.  We utilize a two-tier approach: (1) establishment of specific reserves for impaired loans, and (2) establishment of a general valuation allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio.  We maintain a loan review system which allows for a periodic review of the loan portfolio and the early identification of impaired loans.  One- to four-family residential real estate loans and consumer installment loans are considered to be homogeneous and, therefore, are not separately evaluated for impairment unless they are considered troubled debt restructurings.  A loan is considered to be a troubled   

29 

Table of Contents  

debt restructuring when, to maximize the recovery of the loan we modify the borrower s existing loan terms and conditions in response to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower. 

In establishing specific reserves for impaired loans, we take into consideration, among other things, payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.     Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length and reason for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to what is owed.    A loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  All loans identified as impaired are evaluated individually.  We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes.  Loan impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Payments received on impaired loans are generally applied first to principal and then to interest. 

The general valuation allowance is based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss rates, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and management s judgment.  Regardless of the extent of the analysis of customer performance, portfolio evaluations, trends or risk management processes established, certain inherent, but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio.  This is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their financial condition, the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends, and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allocated allowances for homogeneous groups of loans among other factors.  These other risk factors are continually reviewed and revised by management using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. 

Although we believe that we use the best information available to recognize losses on loans and establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors.  In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.  That agency may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. 

Deferred Income Taxes.    We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities.  These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income.  The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change.  Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.  A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect earnings.  Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the deferred tax assets. 

Fair Value Measurements.    We use our best judgment in estimating fair value measurements of the Bank s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique.  We utilize various assumptions and valuation techniques to determine fair value, including, but not limited to cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity, quoted market prices, and appraisals.  The fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that could have been realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated.  The estimated fair value amounts have not been re-evaluated or updated subsequent to the respective reporting dates.  As such, the estimated fair values subsequent to the respective dates may be different than the amounts reported.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 

Assets.    Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $227.9 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 1.2%, from $225.1 million at June 30, 2016.  This increase is primarily due to an increase in loan balances of $8.5 million, or 4.3%, to $206.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $198.3 million at June 30, 2016.  This increase was offset by a decrease in cash and due from financial institutions and interest-earning deposits of $6.0 million, or 40.3%, to $8.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $14.9 million at June 30, 2016. 

Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Loan Losses.    We had non-performing assets of $2.2 million, or 1.0% of total assets as of September 30, 2016 and $2.3 million, or 1.0% of total assets as of June 30, 2016.  The allowance for loan losses totaled $3.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $2.9 million at June 30, 2016.  This represents a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans receivable of 1.5% at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 172.2% at September 30, 2016 and 163.7% at June 30, 2016.   

Deposits.   Total deposits increased $2.7 million, or 1.4%, to $189.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $187.0 million at June 30, 2016.  The increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and a $4.0 million increase in money market accounts, offset by an $841,000 decrease in interest-bearing NOW accounts and a $2.8 million decrease in certificates of deposit. 

Stockholders  Equity.   Total stockholder s equity increased $279,000, or 0.8% to $36.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $36.0 million at June 30, 2016.  Increase was primarily related to net income recorded. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

General.   Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $265,000.  This represented a decrease of $10,000, or 3.6%, from net income of $275,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Total interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $90,000, or 4.2%, to $2.2 million, from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in interest income was due to an increase in interest income in loans, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on securities.   

Interest income from loans increased $116,000, or 5.6%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million for the same period in 2015.  The increase in interest income from loans was due primarily to an increase of $21.6 million in average loan balances.  Average loan balances were $205.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $183.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in our average loan balance was primarily due to increased loan demand, primarily attributable to improved economic conditions in our market areas and growth in commercial loans originated in all branches.  The average yield on loans decreased 25 basis points to 4.28% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other interest income decreased $26,000, or 55.3%, to $21,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $47,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average balances of securities. 

Interest Expense.     Interest expense increased $19,000, or 7.7%, to $266,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $248,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due to an increase in interest expense on deposit accounts from increased average balances.  Average balances for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $163.6 million compared to $153.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $72,000, or 3.8%, to $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Average interest-earning assets were $214.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $197.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, while the average yield was 4.13% and 4.30% for the respective periods.  Our net interest spread decreased 17 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to 3.48% from 3.65% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 3.64% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.80% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The ratio of average interest-earning assets to

average interest-bearing liabilities increased 200 basis points to 131.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 129.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Provision for Loan Losses.     We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to operations, at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio.  In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change.  Based on our evaluation of these factors, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $153,000 and $73,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily a result of loan growth.  The allowance for loan losses was $3.1 million, or 1.5% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.7 million, or 1.4% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2015.  The non-performing assets to total assets ratio at September 30, 2016 was 1.0% as compared to 0.9% at September 30, 2015.  The level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from estimates. 

Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.  While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may request to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2016 was maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio, such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. 

Non-Interest Income.   Non-interest income increased $80,000, or 13.1% to $693,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $613,000 for the three months September 30, 2015.  Increases were recorded in all categories of non-interest income, including service charges on deposit accounts of $20,000, brokerage fee income of $21,000, gain on sale of loans of $20,000 and other loan fees of $11,000.  These increases were related to increased activity in all areas.  

Non-Interest Expense.   Total non-interest expense was $2.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Increases in occupancy and equipment costs, data processing fees and regulatory fees were offset by decreases in professional fees, advertising and public relation costs, salaries and employee benefits, director and committee fees and insurance and bond premiums. 

Income Tax Expense.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $128,000 compared to $39,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The effective tax rate for the three months September 30, 2016 was 32.6% compared to 12.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015 a reversal of an income tax valuation allowance was recorded for $79,000.  This caused a decrease in the effective tax rate.  There was no such entry during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Analysis of Net Interest Income 

The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs and certain other information for the periods indicated.  No tax equivalent adjustments were made.  All average balances are monthly average balances.  Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Rate/Volume Analysis 

The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to the changes in interest rates.  For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume).  For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs.  Liquid assets, which include cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale, totaled $9.5 million, or 4.2% of total assets at September 30, 2016, as compared to $15.6 million, or 6.9% of total assets, at June 30, 2016.   We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments.  We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. 

Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations.  While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.  We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits.  In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning investments and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.  Short-term interest-earning deposits with the FHLB of Topeka and Midwest Independent Bank amounted to $5.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $12.4 million at June 30, 2016. 

A significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities.  Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts, along with advances from the FHLB of Topeka. 

Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.  If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB which provides an additional source of funds.

Our cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $447,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 while net cash used by operating activities was $128,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net cash used by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from sales, calls, and maturities of securities and proceeds from the pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $9.0 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased $469,000 of securities classified as available-for-sale.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 there were no securities purchased or sold.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 million, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used by financing activities was $3.7 million. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements.    In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements.  These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk.  Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions, other than loan origination commitments, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of our lending activities. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company, please see Note 3 of the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements, beginning on page 9. 

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation.  Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the Company s performance than does the effect of inflation.  Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, because such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

This item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  In addition, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
