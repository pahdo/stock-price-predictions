Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation

HealthWarehouse.com, Inc. ("HEWA" or the "Company"), a Delaware company incorporated in 1998, is an online mail order pharmacy, licensed and/or authorized to sell and deliver prescriptions in 50 states and the District of Columbia focusing on the out-of-pocket prescription drug market. The Company is Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site ("VIPPS") accredited by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy ("NABP").  The Company markets a complete range of generic, brand name, and pet prescription medications as well as over-the-counter ("OTC") medications and products.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and for the year then ended, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K on March 25, 2016.

2. Going Concern and Management's Liquidity Plans

Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through debt and equity financings and advances from related parties. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $4,610,794 and an accumulated deficit of $32,727,335.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred net losses of $1,311,259 and used cash in operating activities of $227,611.   These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company is subject to a 2013 Notice of Redemption related to its Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock aggregating $1,000,000, whereby the Company must now apply all of its assets to redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the Company is not permitted to utilize toward the redemption those assets required to pay its debts as they come due and those assets required to continue as a going concern).

The Company recognizes it will need to raise additional capital in order to fund operations, meet its payment obligations, including its obligations under a loan and security agreement (see Note 5), and execute its business plan. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, attempt to extend note repayments, attempt to negotiate the preferred stock redemption and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.  If the Company is unable to obtain financing on a timely basis, the Company could be forced to sell its assets, discontinue its operation and /or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HealthWarehouse.com, Inc., Hwareh.com, Inc., Hocks.com, Inc., ION Holding NV and ION Belgium NV, its wholly-owned subsidiaries. ION Holding NV and ION Belgium NV are inactive subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The Company's significant estimates include reserves related to accounts receivable and inventory, the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, the valuation of equity instruments and debt discounts.

Reclassifications

Certain accounts in the prior period condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for comparison purposes to conform to the presentation of the current period condensed consolidated financial statements.  These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net loss.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock

Basic net earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other instruments to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock.  Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share if their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and consist of the following:

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect it to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230) , ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 adds and clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, reducing the existing diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles on this topic. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adopting this guidance will have on classifications in its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

4. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following:

5. Notes Payable

The Company is a party to a Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with a lender (the "Lender"). Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $1,200,000 from the Lender (the "Loan"), including $200,000 and $308,911 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Loan is evidenced by a promissory note (the "Senior Note") in the face amount of $1,200,000 (as amended).  The Senior Note bears interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note until the full amount of principal has been paid at a floating rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 4.25% per annum (7.75% as of September 30, 2016).  Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company has agreed to make monthly payments of accrued interest on the first day of every month. The principal amount and all unpaid accrued interest on the Note was payable on September 30, 2016, or earlier in the event of default or a sale or liquidation of the Company. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time by the Company without penalty.  The Company granted the Lender a first, priority security interest in all Company's assets, to secure the Company's obligation to repay the Loan, including a Deposit Account Control Agreement, which grants the Lender a security interest in certain bank accounts.  In addition, the Company is required to direct the proceeds of its credit card receipts to a cash collateral account controlled by the Lender.  The Company also borrowed and repaid $50,000 from the Lender in a separate transaction during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  See Note 10   Subsequent Events for additional information.

Beginning on October 4, 2016, the Company has executed three successive amendments to the Senior Note, effective September 30, 2016, pursuant to   which the Lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the Senior Note from September 30, 2016 to November 30, 2016.  The Senior Note contained financial covenants which required the Company to meet certain minimum targets for earnings before interest, taxes and non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation ("EBITDAS").  In conjunction with the amendments to Senior Note, the Company is no longer required to meet any financial covenant.

On January 11, 2016, the Company executed an Amendment to an existing promissory note ("Promissory Note") in the face amount of $100,000 with a different lender, effective October 31, 2015, which extended the maturity date of the note payable from November 1, 2015 to October 31, 2016.  In consideration of the extension of the maturity date of the note payable, the Company issued to the lender a five-year warrant to purchase 75,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The warrants had a fair value of $15,500 using the Black-Scholes model (see Note 6   Stockholders' Deficiency) which was established as debt discount during the nine  months ended September 30, 2016 and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the Promissory Note.  Including the value of the warrants issued in connection with the extension of the maturity date of the Promissory Note, the Promissory Note has an effective interest rate of 23% per annum during the extension period. 

The Company recorded amortization of debt discount associated with notes payable of $5,167 and $13,778   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $18,367 and $98,134 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

6. Stockholders' Deficiency

Common Stock

On July 28, 2016, the Company entered an Exchange Agreement with Dellave Holdings LLC ("Dellave") whereby the Company issued an aggregate of 2,253,528 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of accounts payable balances totaling $698,594 held by Dellave.  The exchange was based on the prior day's closing price of $0.31.   The $698,594 aggregate fair value of the common stock issued was credited to equity at conversion. Mr. Timothy Reilly is the managing member of Dellave.  Mr. Reilly is also the managing member of Melrose Capital Advisors, LLC, the Company's senior lender at the time of the transaction.

Preferred Stock

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued contractual dividends of $256,675 and $319,853, respectively, related to the Series B Preferred Stock.  On January 1, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 33,847 and 31,633 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock valued at approximately $320,000 and $299,000, respectively, representing approximately $0.66 in value per share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding on each date, to the Series B convertible preferred stock holders as payment in kind for dividends.

Stock Options

Valuation

In applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to stock options, the Company used the following weighted average assumptions:

The Company estimated forfeitures at a weighted average annual rate of 3% to 4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Grants

The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.35 and $0.29 per share, respectively.  The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $0.12 and $0.10 per share, respectively.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to consultants and directors of the Company to purchase an aggregate of 428,906 shares of common stock under a previously approved plan at exercise price ranging between $0.24 and $0.35 per share for an aggregate grant date value of $123,931.  The options vested on the grant date and have a term of ten years.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses and totaled $101,421 and $213,860 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $59,546 and $258,114 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

As of September 30, 2016, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options of $63,721 remains unamortized, which is being amortized over the weighted average remaining period of 1.7 years.

Operating Leases

The Company leases approximately 28,500 square feet of office and storage space.

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits and other claims and proceedings that might arise from litigation matters or regulatory audits. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and outcomes are often not predictable with assurance. Our management does not presently expect that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial condition or condensed consolidated results of operations.

Net Sales

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $2,716,982 from $1,689,457 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,027,525, or 60.8% due to an increase in core consumer prescription and over-the-counter sales.  The core prescription sales grew by $818,749 or 62.6% as new customers grew 105.1% and repeat customers grew 60.6%, in comparison to the same quarter of the prior year, continuing the upward trend experienced during 2015.  Core over-the-counter sales grew by $187,519 or 63.8% and order volume increased by 84.5% due to continued advertising efforts and improved order fulfillment rates and customer satisfaction.  The combined third quarter core consumer prescription and over-the-counter sales increased 63.8% while order volume increased 86.5% when compared to order levels of the same quarter of the prior year due to new customer acquisition through advertising and customer retention.

The Company has expanded its new customer sales through a combination of on-line advertising, 3 rd -party website referral and had benefited from being prominently featured in two nationally recognized consumer magazines during the fourth quarter of 2015 as having the lowest price among top US Pharmacies for five commonly prescribed medications. We believe the Company will continue its growth as more consumer become aware of the Company's value proposition.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

Cost of sales were $928,342 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $604,153 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $ 324,189, or 53.7%, primarily as a result of an increase in consumer prescription and over-the-counter order volume. Gross margin percentage increased from 64.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 65.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to improved procurement.  There was minimal change in the gross margins on the core consumer prescription and over-the-counter business during the quarter.  Management will continue to focus its advertising and operational efforts on promoting and offering its higher margin product lines to consumers and strategic purchasing efforts to further improve costs.

Gross margin percentage decreased slightly from 64.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 64.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to one-time higher margin business-to-business opportunities in 2015 and a slight reduction in margins for the core consumer prescription and over-the-counter business.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased from $156,464 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $91,989 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $64,475 or 41.2%, primarily due to a decrease in amortization of debt discounts partially offset by higher notes payable balances and higher interest rates.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. We believe that:

Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and

Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it excludes non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and nonrecurring charges, which the amount of such expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly between periods.

We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our lenders, stockholders and board of directors concerning our financial performance.

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using Adjusted EBITDA through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, specifically net loss.

The Company had reported the calculation of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Stock-Based Compensation ("EBITDAS") in previous filings because the Company's Senior Note agreement contained financial covenants which required the Company to meet certain minimum levels of EBITDAS.  The Senior Note no longer contains such a requirement; therefore, the Company has discontinued the presentation of EBITDAS.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.

Impact of Inflation

We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through debt and equity financings and advances from stockholders.  As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency of $4,610,794 and an accumulated deficit of $32,727,335.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred net losses of $1,311,335 and used cash in operating activities of $227,611. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company is subject to a Notice of Redemption related to our Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock aggregating $1,000,000 and must apply all our assets to redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (we are not permitted to utilize toward the redemption those assets required to pay our debts as they come due and those assets required to continue as a going concern).

We recognize that we will need to raise additional capital to fund operations, meet our payment obligations, including its obligations under a loan and security agreement (see Notes 5 and 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements) and the redemption of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, and execute our business plan. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us and whether we will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we will need to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, extend note repayments, extend the preferred stock redemption and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.  If we are unable to obtain financing on a timely basis, we could be forced to sell our assets, discontinue our operations and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had cash on hand, net of restricted cash, of $3,950 and $11,217, respectively.  Our cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities during these periods were as follows:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows included net cash used in operating activities of $227,611.  This amount included a decrease in operating cash related to a net loss of $1,236,259, partially offset by aggregate non-cash adjustments of $185,354 and aggregate cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $823,294 (primarily a result of increased accounts payable offset by increased inventories).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash flows included net cash used in operating activities of $407,825.  This amount included a decrease in operating cash related to a net loss of $443,073, offset by aggregate non-cash adjustments of $390,784, plus aggregate cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $355,536 (primarily a result of a reduction of accounts payable).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $20,352 related primarily to a decrease in restricted cash.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $12,413 related to a reduction in restricted cash offset by the capitalization of website development costs and the purchase of computer equipment.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $240,696 primarily related to $308,911 of notes payable offset by principal payments on equipment leases and repayment of notes payable.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used by financing activities was $85,365 related to the principal payment on equipment leases and notes payable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

There are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Form 10-K filed on March 25, 2016. Please refer to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Not applicable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the forms and rules of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 Q, our management, (Chief Executive and Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Management had previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 (see Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 25, 2016), which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, management implemented policies, procedures and controls to address the weaknesses in various areas including operational and financial systems integration, separation of duties in review and approval of disbursement, cash handling, purchasing, receiving, shipping and invoicing functions, daily transaction processing and monthly financial closing procedures and timelines and board approval of related party and other significant transactions.

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company hired a Chief Financial Officer with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address the accounting for complex transactions.  The Chief Financial Officer has been developing a plan to continue to evaluate the controls and procedures implemented in the prior year.  The Chief Financial Officer left the employment of the Company on October 9, 2016.  The Company intends to hire a new Chief Financial Officer at a future date. Until the Company hires a Chief Financial Officer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's accounting staff, supplemented by external accounting consultants with SEC experience, plan to continue to evaluate the controls and procedures implemented in the prior year and 2016.

Management believes that the controls implemented in these specific areas are sufficient to address the above weaknesses, however, they have concluded that such controls have not been in place for a sufficient period of time in order to conclude that the identified material weaknesses described above have been fully remediated.  Therefore, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls were not effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except as discussed above.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits and other claims and proceedings that might arise from litigation matters or regulatory audits. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and outcomes are often not predictable with assurance. Our management does not presently expect that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are not currently involved in any pending or threatened material litigation or other material legal proceedings nor have we been made aware of any penalties from regulatory audits, except as described below.

On May 13, 2016, Taft Stettinius   Hollister, LLP (the "Plaintiff") filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for Hamilton County, Ohio against Healthwarehouse.com, Inc. (the "Company").  The complaint alleges that the Plaintiff provided legal services to the Company beginning in April 2011 until January 2015 and billed the Company in the amount of $936,777, and for which the Company has not made payment. The complaint seeks damages against the Company in the amount of $936,777 plus interest.  The Company is in the process of investigating such claims and intends to defend the action vigorously.

In that connection, the Employee hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers and conveys to the Company all of his right, title and interest, if any, in and to the Company's Intellectual Property, including any rights the Employee may have of patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights in the Company's Intellectual Property.

The Employee further acknowledges that if he breaches any provision of this Section 7, the Company will suffer irreparable injury. It is therefore agreed that the Company shall have the right to enjoin any such breach or threatened breach, without posting any bond, if ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The existence of this right to injunctive and other equitable relief shall not limit any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law or in equity including, without limitation, the right to monetary and compensatory damages.  In addition, the Employee further acknowledges that if he breaches any provision of this Section 7 following his termination of employment with the Company, the Employee will forfeit the right to any unpaid severance or other payments

If any provisions of this Section 7 are held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidation or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Section 7 (or any portion thereof).
