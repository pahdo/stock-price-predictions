  1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  We prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three and nine months ended     October 1, 2016   of Select Comfort Corporation and 100%-owned subsidiaries (Select Comfort or the Company), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and they reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   October 1, 2016  , and   January 2, 2016  , and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Our historical and quarterly consolidated results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year or any future period. 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our most recent audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016   and other recent filings with the SEC. 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales, expenses and income taxes during the reporting period. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies consist of stock-based compensation, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, warranty liabilities and revenue recognition. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Select Comfort Corporation and our 100%-owned subsidiaries. All significant intra-entity balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This new guidance was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date from fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years). Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this new guidance. We are evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and have not yet selected a transition method. 
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. It is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, but early adoption is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for leases and generally requires most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. This new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this new guidance are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented. We are evaluating the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for, and disclosure of, stock-based compensation which will be effective for us beginning in 2017. The new guidance is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the current guidance, excess tax benefits and deficiencies have been recognized in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Upon adoption of the new guidance, these excess tax benefits or deficiencies are required to be recognized as discrete adjustments to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We will adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis and these discrete adjustments could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income.

2. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, our financial assets at October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair value (in thousands): 

At   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , we had   $2.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, of debt and equity securities that fund our deferred compensation plan and are classified in other assets. We also had corresponding deferred compensation plan liabilities of   $2.3 million   and   $1.6 million   at   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively, which are included in other long-term liabilities. The majority of the debt and equity securities are Level 1 as they trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis. Unrealized gains/(losses) on the debt and equity securities offset those associated with the corresponding deferred compensation plan liabilities. 

3. Marketable Debt Securities 
    
  The following tables set forth our investments in marketable debt securities at October 1, 2016 and January 2, 2016 (in thousands):

Maturities of marketable debt securities were as follows (in thousands): 

During the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , we received proceeds of   $15.1 million   and   $101.0 million  , respectively, from marketable debt securities. During the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , we received proceeds of   $59.2 million   from marketable debt securities. There were no proceeds from marketable debt securities for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  .  

4. Inventories 
    
  Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): 

5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Acquisition 
    
  In September 2015, we completed the acquisition of BAM Labs, Inc. (now operating as SleepIQ LABS), the leading provider of biometric sensor and sleep monitoring for data-driven health and wellness. 
    
  Prior to September 2015, we held a   $6.0 million   minority equity investment in BAM Labs, Inc. based on the cost method. In connection with the acquisition, our equity investment was remeasured to a fair value of   $12.9 million   resulting in a   $3.5 million   gain net of expenses, including   $3.4 million   of acquisition-related expenses. We acquired the remaining capital stock of BAM Labs, Inc. for   $57.1 million   for a total enterprise value of   $70.0 million  . The acquisition of BAMS Labs, Inc. did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, operating cash flows or financial position.

Amortization expense for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , was   $1.9 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 

6. Credit Agreement 
     
  Our revolving credit facility, as amended, has a net aggregate availability of   $150 million  . The credit facility is for general corporate purposes and is utilized to meet our seasonal working capital requirements. The credit facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of the available credit from   $150 million   up to   $200 million  , subject to lenders' approval. The credit facility matures in   February 2021  .  
    
  The credit agreement provides the lenders with a collateral security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and requires us to comply with, among other things, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Under the terms of the credit agreement we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our leverage ratio. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit and we were in compliance with all financial covenants.

Each calendar quarter, we may make a discretionary contribution equal to a percentage of the employee s contribution. During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , our contributions, net of forfeitures, were   $1.1 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively.

Legal Proceedings 
      
  We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including primarily commercial, product liability, employment and intellectual property claims. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements with respect to any of these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. With respect to currently pending legal proceedings, we have not established an estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses either because we believe that we have valid defenses to claims asserted against us or the proceedings have not advanced to a stage of discovery that would enable us to establish an estimate. We currently do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more claims asserted against us could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We expense legal costs as incurred. 
    
  On December 4, 2015, Saeid Azimpour, a consumer, filed a purported class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minnesota alleging he was fraudulently induced to purchase a down alternative pillow at a Sleep Number store based on signage that indicated that the pillow was 50% off. Plaintiff alleged that the price he paid for the pillow was not truly 50% off the price at which Sleep Number previously sold the pillow. Plaintiff asserted 10 causes of action including consumer fraud, unlawful trade practices, deceptive trade practices under Minnesota law, violation of the Minnesota false advertising law, unjust enrichment, violation of the California unfair competition law, violation of the California false advertising law and violation of the California remedies act. Plaintiff sought to represent all individuals who  purchased one or more items from the Company advertised or priced at a discount from the original retail price at any time between December 1, 2011 and present.  Plaintiff sought injunctive relief, damages, disgorgement and attorneys  fees. On June 13, 2016, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice. On August 25, 2016, plaintiff filed a new complaint asserting claims and prayers for relief similar to those described above. We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend this case.

  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included herein. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance.

These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. 
     
  These risks and uncertainties include, among others: 

Current and future general and industry economic trends and consumer confidence; 
                
    The effectiveness of our marketing messages; 
                
    The efficiency of our advertising and promotional efforts; 
                
    Our ability to execute our Company-Controlled distribution strategy; 
                
    Our ability to achieve and maintain acceptable levels of product and service quality, and acceptable product return and warranty claims rates; 
                
    Our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line; 
                
    Consumer acceptance of our products, product quality, innovation and brand image; 
                
    Industry competition, the emergence of additional competitive products, and the adequacy of our intellectual property rights to protect our products and brand from competitive or infringing activities; 
                
    Availability of attractive and cost-effective consumer credit options; 
                
    Pending and unforeseen litigation and the potential for adverse publicity associated with litigation; 
                
    Our  just-in-time  manufacturing processes with minimal levels of inventory, which may leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply; 
                
    Our dependence on significant suppliers and our ability to maintain relationships with key suppliers, including several sole-source suppliers; 
                
    The vulnerability of key suppliers to recessionary pressures, labor negotiations, liquidity concerns or other factors; 
                
    Rising commodity costs and other inflationary pressures; 
                
    Risks inherent in global sourcing activities; 
                
    Risks of disruption in the operation of either of our two main manufacturing facilities; 
                
    Increasing government regulations, which have added or may add cost pressures or process changes to ensure compliance; 
                
    The adequacy of our management information systems to meet the evolving needs of our business and to protect sensitive data from potential cyber threats; 
                
    The costs, distractions and potential disruptions to our business related to upgrading our management information systems; 
                
    Our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, executive and other key employees, including qualified retail sales professionals and managers; and 
                
    Uncertainties arising from global events, such as terrorist attacks, political unrest or a pandemic outbreak, or the threat of such events. 
        
  Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained under the caption  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

Results of Operations 
    
  Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results 
    
  Quarterly and year-to-date operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including increases or decreases in sales, the timing, amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures, changes in sales return rates or warranty experience, timing of investments in growth initiatives and infrastructure, timing of store openings/closings and related expenses, changes in net sales resulting from changes in our store base, the timing of new product introductions, the timing of promotional offerings, competitive factors, changes in commodity costs, any disruptions in supplies or third-party service providers, seasonality of retail and bedding industry sales, consumer confidence and general economic conditions. Therefore, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future period. 

Highlights 
    
  Financial highlights for the period ended   October 1, 2016   were as follows: 

Net sales for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   were   $368 million  , compared with   $374 million   for the same period one year ago. The sales decrease resulted from an   8%   comparable sales   decline   in our Company-Controlled channel, partially offset by 7 percentage points (ppt.) of growth from sales generated by   52   net new stores opened in the past 12 months.  
     
   15 

     Index  

Sales per store (for stores open at least one year), on a trailing twelve-month basis for the period ended   October 1, 2016  , were   $2.2 million  , compared with   $2.6 million   for the prior-year trailing twelve-month period. The   12%   decline was mainly due to our ERP implementation's negative impact on sales during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first half of 2016.  
                
    Operating income for the quarter totaled   $39 million  , or   10.6%   of net sales, compared with   $45 million  , or   12.1%   of net sales, for the same period one year ago. The decrease in operating income was attributable to: (i) the 2% decrease in net sales; (ii) $3.5 million of additional research and development expenses to support the advancement of our product innovation pipeline, including expenses related to SleepIQ LABS' operations (acquired on September 15, 2015); and (iii) increase in depreciation expense related to new stores and our ERP system.  
                
    Net income for the quarter was   $26 million  , or   $0.56   per diluted share, compared with net income of   $32 million  , or   $0.62   per diluted share, for the same period one year ago. 
                
    Cash provided by operating activities totaled   $145 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , compared with   $132 million   for the same period one year ago. With the completion of our ERP implementation, investing activities for the current-year period included   $39 million   of property and equipment purchases, compared with   $61 million   for the same period last year. 
                
    At   October 1, 2016  , cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaled   $51 million   and we ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $150 million revolving credit facility. 
                
    In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we repurchased   1.0 million   shares of our common stock under our Board-approved share repurchase program at a cost of   $25.0 million   (an average of   $24.57   per share). Effective as of July 3, 2016, our Board approved an increase in our total remaining share repurchase authorization to $300 million. At   October 1, 2016  , the remaining authorization was   $275 million  .

Comparison of Three Months Ended   October 1, 2016   with Three Months Ended   October 3, 2015    
    
  Net sales 
  Net sales   decreased     2%   to   $368 million   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared with   $374 million   for the same period one year ago. The sales decrease resulted from an   8%   comparable sales   decline   in our Company-Controlled channel, partially offset by 7 percentage points (ppt.) of growth from sales generated by   52   net new stores opened in the past 12 months.  
    
  The   $6 million   net sales decrease compared with the same period one year ago was comprised of the following: (i) a $28 million decrease in sales from our Company-Controlled comparable sales; and (ii) a $2 million decrease in Wholesale/Other channel sales; partially offset by (iii) a $24 million increase resulting from net store openings. Company-Controlled mattress unit sales were essentially in line with the prior-year period. Average revenue per mattress unit in our Company-Controlled channel decreased by   1%   to   $3,959  . 
    
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit of   $232 million     decreased   by   $1 million   compared with the same period one year ago. The gross profit rate increased to   63.1%   of net sales for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared with   62.5%   for the same period last year. The gross profit rate improvement of 0.6 ppt. was primarily due to material costs reductions and lower sales return and exchange costs. In addition, our gross profit rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of other factors, including warranty expenses, product mix changes and performance-based incentive compensation.  
    
  Sales and marketing expenses 
  Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   increased to   $158 million  , or   42.9%   of net sales, compared with   $157 million  , or   42.0%   of net sales, for the same period one year ago. The $1 million increase in the sales and marketing expenses in the current period was due to a $2 million increase in store occupancy expenses primarily due to operating   52   net new stores, partially offset by lower marketing costs. 
    
  General and administrative expenses 
  General and administrative (G A) expenses totaled   $28 million   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , consistent with the same period one year ago, but increased to   7.7%   of net sales, compared with   7.4%   of net sales last year. G A expenses for the three months ended October 3, 2015 included the following non-recurring items: (i) $7.0 million of data conversion and training expenses to support the October 2015 launch of our ERP system; partially offset by (ii) a $3.5 million gain (net of acquisition related expenses) related to our previously held minority equity investment in BAM Labs, Inc. (BAM Labs). See Note 5,   Goodwill and Intangible Assets,   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The net expense decrease of the non-recurring items for the three months ended October 1, 2016 was offset by: (i) $1.7 million of additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures to support the growth of the business, including our new ERP system which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2015; and (ii) a $2.3 million net increase in legal and other G A expenses. The G A expense rate increased by   0.3   ppt. in the current year period compared with the same period one year ago due to the deleveraging impact from the 2% net sales decrease. 
    
  Research and development expenses 
  Research and development (R D) expenses for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   were   $7.0 million  , or   1.9%   of net sales, compared with   $3.5 million  , or   0.9%   of net sales, for the same period one year ago. The   $3.5 million   increase in R D expenses was due to increased investments to support product innovations, including $2.6 million of expenses related to SleepIQ LABS' operations (acquired on September 15, 2015). The year-over-year increase is consistent with our long-term consumer innovation strategy. 
    
  Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was $13 million for the   three months ended   October 1, 2016, compared with $14 million for the same period one year ago. The effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2016 was 33.6% compared with 30.0% for the prior-year period. The lower effective tax rate for the prior-year period primarily resulted from tax planning benefits associated with the BAM Labs acquisition gain.

Comparison of   Nine Months Ended     October 1, 2016   with   Nine Months Ended     October 3, 2015    
    
  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system 
  In the fourth quarter 2015, we replaced our nearly 20-year-old legacy computer systems with a new vertically-integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We experienced technical and operational issues in our plants and supply chain as we implemented the new system, which led to delivery delays and inconveniences for our customers. We completed our ERP implementation by the end of the first quarter of 2016. We experienced residual impacts from the ERP implementation that negatively affected first-quarter and second-quarter 2016 net sales and profits. The system is operating at normal service levels across our vertical enterprise. 
    
  Net sales 
  Net sales totaled   $998 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , compared with   $999 million   for the same period one year ago. The sales change was comprised of a   6%   comparable sales decrease in our Company-Controlled channel, offset by 6 percentage points (ppt.) of growth from sales generated by   52   net new retail stores opened in the past 12 months and an increase in Wholesale/Other channel sales. Net sales for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   benefited from the delivery of our 2015 year-end order backlog, offset by sales pressures from elevated order cancellations, customer appeasements and higher than normal sales returns resulting from the ERP implementation challenges we experienced in the first half of 2016. 
    
  The   $1 million   net sales decrease compared with the same period one year ago was comprised of the following: (i) a $56 million decrease in sales from our Company-Controlled comparable sales; partially offset by (ii) a $54 million increase resulting from net store openings; and (iii) a $1 million increase in Wholesale/Other channel sales. Company-Controlled mattress units   decreased   1% compared to the prior-year period. Average revenue per mattress unit in our Company-Controlled channel increased by   1%  .  
    
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit of   $613 million   decreased by   $7 million  , or   1%  , compared with the same period one year ago. The gross profit rate decreased to   61.4%   of net sales for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   62.1%   for the prior-year period. The 0.7 ppt. decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to appeasements, labor inefficiencies and excess freight from actions taken to manage operating issues resulting from our ERP implementation during the first half of 2016. In addition, our gross profit rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of other factors, including raw material price fluctuations, warranty expenses, product mix changes and performance-based incentive compensation. 
    
  Sales and marketing expenses 
  Sales and marketing expenses for the first nine months of   2016     increased   to   $443 million   compared with   $424 million   for the same period one year ago, and increased to   44.4%   of net sales compared with   42.4%   of net sales last year. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in the current period was mainly due to: (i) a $6 million increase in store occupancy expenses primarily due to operating   52   net new stores; (ii) an increase in customer financing expenses, as a larger percentage of our customers took advantage of promotional financing offers; (iii) increased marketing expenses to drive customer traffic to our brand, including a $4 million increase in media expenses; and (iv) higher customer service costs resulting from our ERP implementation challenges. 
    
  General and administrative expenses 
  General and administrative (G A) expenses   increased   to   $86 million   in   2016  , compared with   $80 million   in the prior year, and increased to   8.6%   of net sales, compared with   8.0%   of net sales one year ago. G A expenses for the nine months ended October 3, 2015 included the following non-recurring items: (i) $9.0 million of data conversion and training expenses to support the October 2015 launch of our ERP system; partially offset by (ii) a $3.5 million gain (net of acquisition related expenses) related to our previously held minority equity investment in BAM Labs. See Note 5,   Goodwill and Intangible Assets,   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The net expense decrease of the non-recurring items for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   was more than offset by: (i) $6.2 million of additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures to support the growth of the business, including our new ERP system which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2015; (ii) a $4.9 million increase in employee compensation, including incremental compensation costs to support our strategic growth drivers; and (iii) a $0.7 million net increase in other G A expenses. The G A expense rate increased by 0.6 ppt. in the current year period compared with the same period one year ago due to the items discussed above. 
    
  Research and development expenses 
  Research and development (R D) expenses for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   were   $22 million  , or   2.2%   of net sales, compared with   $10 million  , or   1.0%   of net sales, for the same period one year ago. The   $11 million   increase in R D expenses was due to increased investments to support product innovations, including $9.4 million of expenses related to SleepIQ LABS' operations (acquired on September 15, 2015). The year-over-year increase is consistent with our long-term consumer innovation strategy.

Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was $21 million for the   nine months ended   October 1, 2016, compared with $34 million for the same period one year ago. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended   October 1, 2016 was   33.9%   compared with   32.4%   for the prior-year period. The lower effective tax rate for the prior-year period primarily resulted from tax planning benefits associated with the BAM Labs acquisition gain. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Managing our liquidity and capital resources is an important part of our commitment to deliver superior shareholder value. Our business model, which can operate with minimal working capital, does not require additional capital from external sources to fund operations or organic growth. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities and cash available under our $150 million revolving credit facility. The cash generated from ongoing operations, and cash available under our revolving credit facility are expected to be adequate to maintain operations and fund anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives for the foreseeable future.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaled   $51 million   compared with   $36 million   as of   January 2, 2016  . The   $15 million     increase   was primarily due to   $145 million   of cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by   $39 million   of cash used to purchase property and equipment and   $96 million   of cash used to repurchase our common stock (  $95 million   under our Board-approved share repurchase program and   $1.4 million   in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock grants). 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows (dollars in millions). Amounts may not add due to rounding differences:   

Cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   was   $145 million   compared with   $132 million   for the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  . Significant components of the year-over-year change in cash provided by operating activities included: (i) a $32 million decrease in net income for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared with the same period one year ago; (ii) a $17 million fluctuation in income taxes based on a $15 million income taxes receivable at the end of 2015 compared with a $0.5 million income taxes liability at the end of 2014; (iii) a $13 million fluctuation in accrued compensation and benefits which primarily resulted from year-over-year changes in company-wide performance-based incentive compensation that was earned in 2014 and paid in the first quarter of 2015, compared with no company-wide incentive compensation earned in 2015 that was paid in 2016; and (iv) the ERP implementation issues we experienced in our plants and supply chain during the fourth quarter of 2015 that resulted in higher inventory levels, increased accounts receivables, increased accounts payables and higher customer prepayments at the end of 2015.  
    
  Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $30 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , compared with   $47 million   for the same period one year ago. With the completion of our ERP implementation, investing activities for the current-year period included   $39 million   of property and equipment purchases, compared with   $61 million   for the same period last year. On a net basis, we   decreased   our investments in marketable debt securities by   $9 million   during the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , compared with a   net decrease   of   $72 million   during the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  . In September 2015, we completed the acquisition of BAM Labs. We previously held a $6.0 million minority equity investment in BAM Labs based on the cost method. In connection with the acquisition, our equity investment was remeasured to a fair value of $12.9 million and we acquired the remaining capital stock in BAM Labs for $57.1 million for a total enterprise value of $70.0 million. See Note 5,   Goodwill and Intangible Assets,   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
    
  Net cash   used in   financing activities was   $91 million   for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , compared with   $64 million   for the same period one year ago. During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , we repurchased   $96.4 million   of our stock (  $95.0 million   under our Board-approved share repurchase program and   $1.4 million   in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards) compared with   $70.3 million   (  $68.6 million   under our Board-approved share repurchase program and   $1.7 million   in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards) during the same period one year ago. Changes in book overdrafts are  
  
   20 

     Index  

included in the net change in short-term borrowings. Financing activities for both periods reflect the cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, vesting of employee restricted stock awards along with the associated excess tax benefits. 
    
  Under the Board-approved share repurchase program, we repurchased   4.6 million   shares at a cost of   $95 million   (an average of   $20.78   per share) during the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  . During the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , we repurchased   2.3 million   shares at a cost of   $69 million   (an average of   $29.78   per share). Effective as of July 3, 2016, our Board approved an increase in our total remaining share repurchase authorization to $300 million. At   October 1, 2016  , the remaining authorization was   $275 million  . There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility, as amended, has a net aggregate availability of   $150 million  . The credit facility is for general corporate purposes. The credit facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of available credit from   $150 million   up to   $200 million  , subject to lenders' approval. The credit facility matures in   February 2021  .  
    
  The credit agreement provides the lenders with a collateral security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and requires us to comply with, among other things, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Under the terms of the credit agreement we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our leverage ratio. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit and we were in compliance with all financial covenants.  
    
  We have an agreement with Synchrony Bank to offer qualified customers revolving credit arrangements to finance purchases from us (Synchrony Agreement). The Synchrony Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
    
  Under the terms of the Synchrony Agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, the interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customer accounts, including collection policies and procedures, and is the owner of the accounts.

   (1)    Rent expense is added back to operating income to show the impact of owning versus leasing the related assets. 
    
   (2)    Depreciation is based on the average of the last five fiscal quarters' ending capitalized operating lease obligations (see note 6) for the respective reporting periods with an assumed thirty-year useful life. This is subtracted from operating income to illustrate the impact of owning versus leasing the related assets. 
    
   (3)    Reflects annual effective income tax rates, before discrete adjustments, of   37.8%   and   32.5%   for 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
   (4)    Cash greater than target is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities less customer prepayments in excess of $100 million. 
    
   (5)    Long-term debt includes existing capital lease obligations, if applicable. 
    
   (6)    A multiple of eight times annual rent expense is used as an estimate for capitalizing our operating lease obligations. The methodology utilized aligns with the methodology of a nationally recognized credit rating agency. 
    
   (7)    Average invested capital represents the average of the last five fiscal quarters' ending invested capital balances. 
    
   (8)    ROIC equals NOPAT divided by average invested capital.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect interest income generated from our short-term and long-term investments in marketable debt securities. If overall interest rates were one percentage point lower than current rates, our annual interest income would not change by a significant amount based on our investments in marketable debt securities as of   October 1, 2016  , and the current low interest-rate environment. We do not manage our investment interest-rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including primarily commercial, product liability, employment and intellectual property claims. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements with respect to any of these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. With respect to currently pending legal proceedings, we have not established an estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses either because we believe that we have valid defenses to claims asserted against us or the proceedings have not advanced to a stage of discovery that would enable us to establish an estimate. We currently do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more claims asserted against us could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We expense legal costs as incurred. 
    
  On December 4, 2015, Saeid Azimpour, a consumer, filed a purported class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minnesota alleging he was fraudulently induced to purchase a down alternative pillow at a Sleep Number store based on signage that indicated that the pillow was 50% off. Plaintiff alleged that the price he paid for the pillow was not truly 50% off the price at which Sleep Number previously sold the pillow. Plaintiff asserted 10 causes of action including consumer fraud, unlawful trade practices, deceptive trade practices under Minnesota law, violation of the Minnesota false advertising law, unjust enrichment, violation of the California unfair competition law, violation of the California false advertising law and violation of the California remedies act. Plaintiff sought to represent all individuals who  purchased one or more items from the Company advertised or priced at a discount from the original retail price at any time between December 1, 2011 and present.  Plaintiff sought injunctive relief, damages, disgorgement and attorneys  fees. On June 13, 2016, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice. On August 25, 2016, plaintiff filed a new complaint asserting claims and prayers for relief similar to those described above. We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend this case. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
    
  Our business, financial condition and operating results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including both those that are specific to our business and others that affect all businesses operating in a global environment. Investors should carefully consider the information in this report under the heading,    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    and also the information under the heading,    Risk Factors    in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional risk factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.
