NOTE 1 
     GENERAL  

The condensed consolidated balance
sheet of Chase General Corporation (hereinafter referred to as  Chase ,  we ,  our , and  us )
at June 30, 2016 has been condensed from audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are unaudited
and reflect all normal and recurring accruals and adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented in this quarterly report. The condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together
with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contained in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year
ending June 30, 2017. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
to fairly present financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods have been included. 

No events have occurred subsequent
to September 30, 2016, through the date of filing this form, that would require disclosure in this Form 10-Q or would be required
to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of or for the three month period ended September 30, 2016.

NOTE 2   
       EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (CONTINUED)    

Diluted earnings per share are
calculated by including contingently issuable shares with the weighted average shares outstanding. 

The contingently issuable shares
were not included in diluted earnings per common share as they would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share. Cumulative
Preferred Stock dividends in arrears at September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $7,980,824 and $7,852,752, respectively. Total dividends
in arrears, on a per share basis, consist of the following: 

The 6% convertible prior cumulative
preferred stock may, upon thirty days prior notice, be redeemed by the Corporation at $5.25 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends
to date of redemption. In the event of voluntary liquidation, holders of this stock are entitled to receive $5.25 per share plus
accrued dividends. It may be exchanged for common stock at the option of the shareholders in the ratio of 4 common shares for one
share of Series A and 3.75 common shares for one share of Series B. 

The Company has the privilege
of redemption of 5% convertible cumulative preferred stock at $21.00 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends. In the event of voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, holders of this stock are entitled to receive $20.00 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends. It may
be exchanged for common stock at the option of the shareholders, in the ratio of 3.795 common shares for one of preferred.

     INCOME TAXES  

The Company follows the provisions
for uncertain tax positions as addressed in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740-10. The
Company recognized no liability for unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016. The Company has no material tax positions
at September 30, 2016 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing
of such deductibility. The Company s federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended 2014, 2015 and 2016 are subject
to examination by the IRS taxing authority. 

NOTE 5 
     SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION  

NOTE 6 
     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with
customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance
also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required regarding customer contracts, significant
judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The guidance will initially
be applied retrospectively using one of two methods. The standard will be effective for the entity for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted
beginning for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. The Company is evaluating the impact of the amended revenue recognition guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, 
( ASU 2015-11 ). An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first out ( LIFO ) or the retail
inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The new guidance clarifies that net
realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal, and transportation. The update is effective as of January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

In February 2016, the FASB issued
amended guidance for the treatment of leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding
lease liability for all operating and finance leases with lease terms greater than one year. The guidance also requires both qualitative
and quantitative disclosures regarding the nature of the entity s leasing activities. The guidance will initially be applied
using a modified retrospective approach. The amendments in the guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the amended lease guidance on the its consolidated
financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) . ASU 2014-15 provides guidance
related to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as
a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15,
2016, and for interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15
to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued
ASC Update No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  as part of its simplification initiatives.
This update requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current on the consolidated condensed balance
sheet for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is
permitted. An entity can elect to adopt prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption
of ASU 2015-17 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

There have been no other newly
issued or newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have, or are expected to have, a significant impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  

  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

Chase General Corporation (Chase) is a
holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. This subsidiary is the main operating company that is engaged
in the manufacture of confectionery products which are sold primarily to wholesale houses, grocery accounts, vendors, and repackers.
The subsidiary (Company) operates two divisions, Chase Candy division and Seasonal Candy division, which share a common labor force
and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Therefore, segment reporting for the two divisions is not maintained by
management. 

The Company s business, like that
of many other confectionary product manufacturers, is seasonal. Historically, the Company has realized more of its revenue and
earnings in the fiscal second quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season, than in any other fiscal quarter. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following management comments regarding
Chase s results of operations and outlook should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements
included pursuant to Item 1 of the quarterly report. 

The following table sets forth certain
items as a percentage of net sales and revenues for the periods presented:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  

  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

NET SALES  

Net sales decreased $200,915 or 19% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $862,188 compared to $1,063,103 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross
sales for Seasonal Candy decreased $132,966 to $447,062 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $580,028 for
2015. Gross sales for Chase Candy decreased $70,100 to $421,885 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $491,985
for 2015. Sales returns and allowances for the Company decreased $2,838 to $6,798 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $9,636 for 2015. The Company s other sales decreased $687 to $39 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $726 for 2015. 

The 23% decrease in gross sales of Seasonal
Candy of $132,966 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended September 30, 2015, is primarily
due to the net effect of the following: 1) decreased orders from three customers in the generic seasonal division netting approximately
$148,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to two lost customers and one customer decreasing orders; offset by 2)
increased volume from various customers in the clamshell seasonal division netting approximately $2,000 versus the same period
a year ago primarily due to two customers increasing orders; 3) increased orders in the bulk seasonal division netting approximately
$14,000 due to increased sales to two existing customers. 

The 14% decrease in gross sales of Chase
Candy of $70,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period ended September 30, 2015, is primarily
due to the net effect of the following: 1) decreased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division by approximately $14,000
versus the same period a year ago primarily due to decreased orders from two existing customers; 2) decreased sales of L278/L212
Mini Mash division by approximately $40,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to decreased orders from four existing
customers; and 3) decreased sales of L100, L200, SK436, and SK2100 Cherry Mash Merchandisers division by approximately $17,000
versus the same period a year ago due to decreased orders from five existing customers. 

COST OF SALES  

The cost of sales decreased $171,492 to
$671,891, or 78% of related sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $843,383, or 79% of related sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The 20% decrease in cost of sales of $171,492
is primarily due to the 19% decrease in net sales of $200,915, a 4% decrease in the raw material cost of sugar, and a 3% decrease
in the raw material cost of chocolate offset by a 20% increase in the raw material cost of corn syrup and a 1% increase in the
raw material cost of peanuts. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the
prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  

  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

SELLING EXPENSES  

Selling expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased $23,510 to $99,266, which is 12% of sales, compared to $122,776 or 12% of sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. 

The decrease of $23,510 in selling expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to lower commissions expense for the period, lower promotions expense,
and lower truck and automobile depreciation expense. Commission expense decreased $8,270 to $33,315 for this period from $41,585
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in net sales. Promotions expense decreased $7,982
to $17,075 for this period from $25,057 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net sales
that have a bill-back allowance. Truck and automobile depreciation expense decreased $2,425 to $10,656 for this period from $13,081
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to less of that asset class placed in service in the 2016 period. 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

General and administrative expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $20,695 to $135,746 and increased to 16% of sales, compared to $115,051
or 11% of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increased costs are primarily because of an increase in
professional fees, miscellaneous general expense, and insurance expense. Professional fees expense increased $9,089 to $63,760
for this period from $54,671 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in fees. Miscellaneous
general expense increased $5,180 to $8,063 for this period from $2,883 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily
due to a non-recurring $6,000 expense occurring in the period. Insurance expense increased $5,090 to $27,447 for this period from
$22,357 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a more employees accepting health insurance coverage. 

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  

Other income (expense) decreased by $547
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $(440) compared to $107 for the three months ended September 30, 2015
primarily due to a increase in interest expense of $544. 

INCOME TAX BENEFIT  

The Company recorded a tax benefit for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $17,228 as compared to tax benefit of $1,880 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The income tax benefit recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the net loss before income
taxes. 

NET LOSS  

The Company reported a net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 of $27,927, compared to net loss of $3,746 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. This decrease of $24,181 is explained above.

  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

PREFERRED DIVIDENDS  

Preferred dividends were $32,018 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which reflects additional preferred stock dividends in arrears on the Company s
Series A and Series B $5 par value preferred stock and its Series A and Series B $20 par value preferred stock. 

NET INCOME (LOSS) APPLICABLE TO COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS  

Net loss applicable to common stockholders
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $59,945 which is a decrease of $24,181 as compared to the net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 of $35,764. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The table below presents the summary of
cash flow for the fiscal year indicated. 

Management has made no material commitments
for capital expenditures during the remainder of fiscal 2017. The $17,247 of cash used in investing activities is the purchase
of equipment used during the manufacturing process. The $284,445 of cash used in operating activities is fully detailed in the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on page four. The $288,350 of cash provided by financing activities is primarily
due to the receipt of $275,000 drawn from a line-of-credit, net of principal payments on equipment and vehicle loans. At September 30,
2016, the Company had $75,000 remaining on the line-of-credit, which could be utilized to help fund any working capital requirements.
Management expects that projected cash flows will enable the Company to pay the full balance on the line-of-credit prior to December 31,
2016. 

Management believes that the projected
cash flow from operations, combined with its existing cash balances, will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for the
foreseeable future. 

Management believes that inflation will
have only a minimal effect on future operations since such effects will generally be offset by sales price increases, which are
not expected to have a significant effect upon demand.

actual results to be different from what appear here. These risk factors include: the ability to adequately pass through customers
unanticipated future increases in raw material costs, decreased demand for products, expected orders that do not occur, loss of
key customers, the impact of competition and price erosion as well as supply and manufacturing constraints, and other risks and
uncertainties. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information contained
in this report will prove accurate, and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We assume
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made herein.
