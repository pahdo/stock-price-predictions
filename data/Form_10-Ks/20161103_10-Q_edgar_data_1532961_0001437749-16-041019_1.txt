Equity Transactions   
     
   Secondary offering   
       
  On May 13, 2016, the Company priced a secondary offering of 1,700,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Firm Shares ). Each share was sold at an offering price of $26.25 per share. The shares sold were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), on an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-206644) pursuant to the Securities Act. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters of this secondary offering a 30-day option to purchase an additional 255,000 shares (the  Option Shares ) of common stock to cover over-allotments. On May 18, 2016, the Company closed on the Firm Shares, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $41,000 after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and issued 1,700,000 shares. On June 3, 2016, the Company closed on the full exercise of the Option Shares by the underwriters of the secondary offering with respect to an additional 255,000 shares of its common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $6,200 after deducting the underwriters  discount.   
     
   Warrant exercise   
     
  In conjunction with the Company s initial public offering on March 26, 2013, the underwriter received a warrant to acquire up to 140,000 units at an exercise price of $7.80 per unit ( Unit Warrant ).  Each of these units consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share, which warrant expires on March 27, 2018. On March 23, 2016, the underwriter paid $1,008 to the Company to initiate the exercise of the Unit Warrant.  On March 29, 2016, the Company delivered 140,000 shares of common stock to the underwriter, and, on May 5, 2016, the Company completed the exercise of the Unit Warrant by delivery of the warrant.   

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   
       
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for reporting of interim financial information. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NV5 Global, Inc. and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   
     
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods presented. Accordingly, these statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from those financial statements. The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future interim period or for the full 2016 fiscal year.

  (UNAUDITED)  
  (in thousands, except share data)  
     
    Use of Estimates   
       
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s most recent assessment of underlying facts and circumstances using the most recent information available. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material.   
     
  Estimates and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted when necessary. The more significant estimates affecting amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value estimates used in accounting for business combinations including the valuation of identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration, fair value estimates in determining the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill impairment assessment, revenue recognition on the percentage-of-completion method, allowances for uncollectible accounts and provision for income taxes.   

Concentration of Credit Risk   
       
     Trade receivable balances carried by the Company are comprised of accounts from a diverse client base across a broad range of industries and are not collateralized. However, approximately 35% and 43% of the Company s gross revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are from California-based projects. The Company does not have any client representing more than 10% of gross revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Approximately 50% and 63% of the Company s accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are from government and government-related contracts. Management continually evaluates the creditworthiness of these and future clients and provides for bad debt reserves as necessary.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:   
     
   Level 1  - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2  - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   
     
   Level 3  - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   
     
  The Company considers cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable, accrued liabilities and debt obligations to meet the definition of financial instruments. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period of time between their origination and their expected realization or payment. The carrying amounts of debt obligations approximate their fair values as the terms are comparable to terms currently offered by local lending institutions for arrangements with similar terms to industry peers with comparable credit characteristics.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (UNAUDITED)  
  (in thousands, except share data)  

The Company applies the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,  Business Combinations , in the accounting for its acquisitions, which requires recognition of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets (customer relationships, customer backlog, trade name and non-compete) is based on valuations performed to determine the fair values of such assets as of the acquisition dates. The Company engaged a third-party independent valuation specialist to assist in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions, other than Allwyn and Weir acquisitions which was prepared internally. The fair values of earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates.  The Company estimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out payments are included in General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income.  
     
  Several factors are considered when determining contingent consideration liabilities as part of the purchase price, including whether (i) the valuation of the acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (ii) the former owners of the acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of other key employees.  The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.   
     
  We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates.  Adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in operating income.   
     
  The Company measures contingent consideration recognized in connection with business combinations at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3, as defined in the accounting guidance. The Company uses a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach as a valuation technique to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on the acquisition date and at each reporting period. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are projections over the earn-out period, and the probability outcome percentages that are assigned to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent consideration liabilities. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate on the acquisition date and amount paid will be recorded in earnings (see Note 10).  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets    
     
  Goodwill is the excess of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. To determine the amount of goodwill resulting from a business combination, the Company performs an assessment to determine the acquisition date fair value of the acquired company s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities.   
     
  Goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These qualitative factors include: macroeconomic and industry conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If the entity determines that this threshold is met, then performing the two-step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires a comparison of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with a reporting unit, including goodwill, with the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company determines fair value through multiple valuation techniques, and weights the results accordingly. NV5 Global is required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company would calculate the implied fair value of its reporting unit goodwill as compared to the carrying value of its reporting unit goodwill to determine the appropriate impairment charge, if any. The Company has elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment review on August 1 of each year. The Company historically conducts its annual impairment tests on the goodwill using the quantitative method of evaluating goodwill.

        Identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer backlog, customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If an indicator of impairment exists, the Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then impairment, if any, is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model.   
     
  See Note 7 for further information on goodwill and identified intangibles.  

Earnings Per Share   
       
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. In accordance with the FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per Share , the effect of potentially dilutive securities is not considered during periods of loss or if the effect is anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in calculating basic earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 exclude 434,082 and 411,893 non-vested restricted shares, respectively, issued since 2010. These non-vested restricted shares are not included in basic earnings per share until the vesting requirement is met. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in calculating diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes, if outstanding, non-vested restricted shares and units, issuable shares related to acquisitions, and the shares and warrants associated with the Company s initial public offering. In calculating diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially anti-dilutive securities.   
     
  The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Note 3   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  (in thousands, except share data)  

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize, in the balance sheet, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. The amendments in this accounting standard update are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.   We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-02 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . As part of FASB's accounting simplification initiative, ASU 2015-17 removes the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. Instead, the update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with prospective or retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of this ASU to be material to its consolidated financial statements.   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a   customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU and management has not yet determined which method it will apply. In July 2015, FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date to December 31, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on the Company's consolidated net income, financial position and cash flows.  

Note 4   Business Acquisitions   
       
  On September 12, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Weir Environmental, L.L.C. ( Weir ), a New Orleans, Louisiana-based emergency remediation and environmental assessment firm. Weir also provides residential and commercial property loss consulting services. The purchase price of this acquisition was $1,000 including $300 in cash, $500 promissory note (bearing interest at 3.0%), payable in four installments of $125, due on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of September 12, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition (see Note 9) and $200 of the Company s common stock (6,140 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition.  
     
  On May 20, 2016, the Company acquired Dade Moeller   Associates, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Dade Moeller"). Dade Moeller provides professional services in radiation protection, health physics, and worker safety to government and commercial facilities.  Dade Moeller's technical expertise includes radiation protection, industrial hygiene and safety, environmental services and laboratory consulting.  This acquisition expanded the Company s environmental, health and safety services and allows the Company to offer these services on a broader scale within its existing network. The purchase price of this acquisition was $20,000 including $10,000 in cash, $6,000 in promissory notes (bearing interest at 3.5%), payable in four installments of $1,500, due on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of May 20, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition (see Note 9), $1,000 of the Company s common stock (36,261 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition, and $3,000 in stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s stock, at our discretion, payable in three installments of $1,000, due on the first, second and third anniversaries of May 20, 2016. In order to ultimately determine the fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Dade Moeller, we engaged a third-party independent valuation specialist to assist in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities, however as of the date of this report, the valuation was not final. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation with respect to this transaction by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.

  On February 1, 2016, the Company acquired Sebesta, Inc. ( Sebesta ), a St. Paul, Minnesota-based mechanical, electrical and plumbing ( MEP ) engineering and energy management company. Primary clients include federal and state governments, power and utility companies, and major educational, healthcare, industrial and commercial property owners throughout the United States. The purchase price of this acquisition was $14,000 paid from cash on hand. This acquisition expanded the Company s MEP engineering and energy and allows the Company to offer these services on a broader scale within its existing network. In addition, this acquisition strengthens the Company s geographic diversification and allows the Company to continue expanding its national footprint. In order to ultimately determine the fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Sebesta, we engaged a third-party independent valuation specialist to assist in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities.   
     
  On July 1, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of the RBA, a New Jersey based infrastructure engineering firm focused on the provision of transportation engineering, planning, and construction inspection, environmental engineering, civil engineering, surveying, and architecture services to public and private clients throughout the East Coast.

The purchase price also included a non-interest bearing earn-out of up to $1,000 payable in cash or the Company s common stock, subject to the achievement of certain agreed upon financial metrics for the years ended 2016 and 2017. The earn-out of $1,000 is non-interest bearing and was recorded at its estimated fair value of $406, based on a probability-weighted approach valuation technique used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of this contingent consideration is approximately $533 and $446, respectively. Furthermore, at closing the Company assumed and paid off approximately $4,000 of RBA s indebtedness.

  The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for the acquisitions closed during 2016 and final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition dates for the acquisitions closed during 2015:  

Goodwill was recorded based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired and the amount is attributable to the reputation of the business acquired, the workforce in place and the synergies to be achieved from these acquisitions. The goodwill acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was assigned to the program management (the  PM ) reportable segment. Goodwill of approximately $15,199 is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes for the 2016 acquisitions.    
     
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the results of operations from the businesses acquired during 2016 from its date of acquisition to September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the results include gross revenues of $12,363 and $27,481, respectively, and pre-tax income of approximately $1,108 and $2,560, respectively.

Goodwill   
       
  On August 1, 2016, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests using the quantitative method of evaluating goodwill.

   Litigation, Claims and Assessments   
     
  The Company is subject to certain claims and lawsuits typically filed against the engineering, consulting and construction profession, alleging primarily professional errors or omissions. The Company carries professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and policy limits, against such claims. However, in some actions, parties are seeking damages that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured. While management does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect, individually or in aggregate, on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, management acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of these matters.  
     
  The Company s office leases are classified as operating leases and rent expense is included in facilities and facilities related expense in the Company s consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.

Note 12   Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  In October 2011, the Company s stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in March 2013 (as amended, the  2011 Equity Plan ). The 2011 Equity Plan provides directors, executive officers, and other employees of the Company with additional incentives by allowing them to acquire ownership interest in the business and, as a result, encouraging them to contribute to the Company s success. The Company may provide these incentives through the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units, and other cash-based or stock-based awards. As of September 30, 2016, 685,115 shares of common stock are authorized and reserved for issuance under the 2011 Equity Plan. This reserve automatically increases on each January 1 from 2014 through 2023, by an amount equal to the smaller of (i) 3.5% of the number of shares issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (ii) an amount determined by the Company s Board of Directors. The restricted shares of common stock granted generally provide for service-based vesting after two to four years following the grant date. A summary of the changes in unvested shares of the restricted stock during the year ended September 30, 2016 is presented below.   
     
  The following table summarizes the status of restricted stock awards as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and changes during 2016:  

Share-based compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $655 and $563, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,704 and $1,229, respectively. Approximately $4,852 of deferred compensation, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years, is unrecognized at September 30, 2016.   

Note 13   Income Taxes   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had net current deferred income tax assets of $1,446 and $1,440, respectively, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $1,727 and $1,582, respectively. No valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred income tax assets is needed as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as it is more-likely-than-not that the positions will be realized upon settlement. Deferred income tax liabilities primarily relate to intangible assets and accounting basis adjustments where the Company has a future obligation for tax purposes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not record any deferred tax assets or liabilities in conjunction with the purchase price allocation of acquisitions as a result of the intangibles acquired.   
     
  The Company s consolidated effective income tax rate was 36.9% and 36.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company s consolidated effective income tax rate was 38.3% and 37.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the combined statutory federal and state income tax rate of approximately 39.0% is principally due to the federal domestic production activities deduction.   
     
  The Company evaluates tax positions for recognition using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The California Franchise Tax Board ( CFTB ) is challenging the use of certain research and development tax credits generated and included on the tax returns of an acquired company for the years 2005 to 2009. Fiscal years 2005 through 2015 are considered open tax years in the State of California and 2012 through 2015 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and other state jurisdictions.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $570 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. It is not expected that there will be a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.  

Note 1  4     Reportable Segments   
     
  The Company reports segment information in accordance with ASC Topic No. 280   Segment Reporting   ( Topic No. 280 ). As of September 30, 2016, the Company continues to report based on the following reportable segments:  
     
   Infrastructure, engineering and support services (INF):  The INF reportable segment provides to clients a broad array of services in the area of engineering, design and support services; and   energy services.   
     
   Construction quality assurance (CQA):  The CQA reportable segment provides construction inspection; geotechnical and engineering services; construction claims and litigation services; and environmental quality testing services.  
     
   Program management services (PM) : The PM reportable segment provides program management for transportation and vertical construction projects including construction management. Also currently included in PM are 2016 acquisitions of Sebesta and Dade Moeller.  
     
          The Company evaluates the performance of these reportable segments based on their respective operating income before the effect of amortization expense related to acquisitions and other unallocated corporate expenses. We account for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the sales and transfers were to third parties. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Note 15   Subsequent Events   
     
  On October 26, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of the JBA Consulting Engineers, Inc. ( JBA ), a Las Vegas, Nevada-based MEP engineering, acoustics, technology, and fire protection consulting firm. The acquisition of JBA will expand and strengthen the Company s existing energy and environmental platform by introducing our professionals to new clients and making new services available to our existing clients. The purchase price of this acquisition was $23,000 including $12,000 in cash paid at closing, $7,000 in promissory notes (bearing interest at 3.5%), payable in five installments of $1,400, due on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of October 26, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition, $1,400 of the Company s common stock (44,947 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition, $2,600 in stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s stock, at our discretion, payable in two installments of $1,300, due on the first and second anniversaries of October 26, 2016, and an undertaking to issue by January 24, 2017, an equivalent number of shares of restricted common stock equal to an aggregate of $2,000, to be granted to certain key employees of JBA selected in the Company s sole discretion and vesting over a period of four years.  
     
  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company will recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values and will record an allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The Company expects goodwill will be recorded based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and the amount attributable to the reputation of the businesses acquired, the workforce in place and the synergies to be achieved from these acquisitions. In order to determine the fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company will engage a third party independent valuation specialist to assist in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities of JBA. The initial accounting for this acquisition is incomplete at this time due to the recent closing of this transaction. The Company expects to establish a preliminary purchase price allocation with respect to this transaction by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.

We also serve quasi-public and private sector clients from the education, healthcare, energy, and public utilities, including schools, universities, hospitals, health care providers, insurance providers, large utility service providers, and large to small energy producers.   

Recent Acquisition, Developments and Challenges   
     
    Acquisitions.   
       
    On October 26, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of the JBA Consulting Engineers, Inc. ( JBA ), a Las Vegas, Nevada-based MEP engineering, acoustics, technology, and fire protection consulting firm. We believe that the acquisition of JBA will expand and strengthen our existing energy and environmental platform by introducing our professionals to new clients and making new services available to our existing clients. The purchase price of this acquisition was $23,000 including $12,000 in cash paid at closing, $7,000 in promissory notes (bearing interest at 3.5%), payable in five installments of $1,400, due on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of October 26, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition, $1,400 of the Company s common stock (44,947 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition, $2,600 in stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our discretion, payable in two installments of $1,300, due on the first and second anniversaries of October 26, 2016, and an undertaking to issue by January 24, 2017, an equivalent number of shares of restricted common stock equal to an aggregate of $2,000, to be granted to certain key employees of JBA selected in our sole discretion and vesting over a period of four years.   
     
  On September 12, 2016, we acquired certain assets of Weir Environmental, L.L.C. ( Weir ), a New Orleans, Louisiana-based emergency remediation and environmental assessment firm. Weir also provides residential and commercial property loss consulting services. The purchase price of this acquisition was $1,000 including $300 in cash, $500 promissory note (bearing interest at 3.0%), payable in four installments of $125, due on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of September 12, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition and $200 of our common stock (6,140 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition.  
       
  On February 1, 2016, we acquired Sebesta, Inc. ( Sebesta ), a St. Paul, Minnesota-based mechanical, electrical and plumbing ( MEP ) engineering and energy management company. Primary clients include federal and state governments, power and utility companies, and major educational, healthcare, industrial and commercial property owners throughout the United States. The purchase price of this acquisition was $14,000 paid from cash on hand.  

23

On May 20, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Dade Moeller   Associates, Inc. ( Dade Moeller ), a Richland, Washington-based environmental health and safety firm. Dade Moeller specializes in the provision of radiation exposure and protection services as well as nuclear safety and industrial hygiene analyses, a discipline in which they have built a significant federal government client base.   The purchase price of this acquisition was $20,000 including $10,000 in cash, $6,000 in promissory notes (bearing interest at 3.0%), payable in four installments of $1,500, due on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of May 20, 2016, the effective date of the acquisition, $1,000 of our common stock (36,261 shares) as of the closing date of the acquisition, and $3,000 in shares of our stock or a combination of cash and shares of our stock, at our discretion, payable in three installments of $1,000, due on the first, second and third anniversaries of May 20, 2016.  

Equity Transactions.   
       
  On May 13, 2016, we priced a secondary offering of 1,700,000 shares of our common stock (the  Firm Shares ). Each share was sold at an offering price of $26.25 per share. The shares sold were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), on an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-206644) pursuant to the Securities Act. In addition, we granted the underwriters of this secondary offering a 30-day option to purchase an additional 255,000 shares (the  Option Shares ) of common stock to cover over-allotments. On May 18, 2016, we closed on the Firm Shares for which we received net proceeds of approximately $41,000 after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us and issued 1,700,000 shares. On June 3, 2016, we closed on the full exercise of the Option Shares by the underwriters of the secondary offering with respect to an additional 255,000 shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $6,200 after deducting the underwriters discount.   
     
   Warrant exercise.   
     
  In conjunction with the Company s initial public offering on March 26, 2013, the underwriter received a warrant to acquire up to 140,000 units at an exercise price of $7.80 per unit ( Unit Warrant ).  Each of these units consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share, which warrant expires on March 27, 2018. On March 23, 2016, the underwriter paid $1,008 to the Company to initiate the exercise of the Unit Warrant.  On March 29, 2016, the Company delivered 140,000 shares of common stock to the underwriter, and, on May 5, 2016, the Company completed the exercise of the Unit Warrant by delivery of the warrant.   
       
   Tax credit .   
     
  The California Franchise Tax Board ( CFTB ) is challenging the use of certain research and development tax credits generated and included on the tax returns of an acquired company for the years 2005 to 2009. Fiscal years 2005 through 2015 are considered open tax years in the State of California and 2012 through 2015 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and other state jurisdictions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $570 of unrecognized tax benefits.   
     
    Backlog.     
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $205,000 of gross revenue backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months compared to gross revenue backlog of approximately $155,300 as of December 31, 2015. We include in backlog only those contracts for which funding has been provided and work authorizations have been received. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, from time to time, with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog. For example, certain of our contracts with the U.S. federal government and other clients are terminable at the discretion of the client, with or without cause. These types of backlog reductions could adversely affect our revenue and margins. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.  
     
  Most of our government contracts are multi-year contracts for which funding are appropriated on an annual basis. With respect to such government contracts, our backlog includes only those amounts that have been funded and authorized and does not reflect the full amounts we may receive over the term of such contracts. In the case of non-government contracts, our backlog includes future revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client. For contracts with a not-to-exceed maximum amount, we include revenue from such contracts in backlog to the extent of the remaining estimated amount. We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations until such changes or cancellations occur.  

24

Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant estimated amounts of third-party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties. Moreover, our backlog for the period beyond 12 months may be subject to variations from year-to-year as existing contracts are completed, delayed, or renewed or new contracts are awarded, delayed, or cancelled. As a result, we believe that year-to-year comparisons of the portion of backlog expected to be performed more than one year in the future are difficult to assess and not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability. Because backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not necessarily be comparable to that of our industry peers.  
     
    Segments  .     
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we continue to report based on the following reportable segments:  
     
   Infrastructure, engineering and support services (INF):  The INF reportable segment provides to clients a broad array of services in the area of engineering, design and support services;   and energy services.   
     
   Construction quality assurance (CQA):  The CQA reportable segment provides construction inspection; geotechnical and engineering services; construction claims and litigation services; and environmental quality testing services.  
     
   Program management services (PM) : The PM reportable segment provides program management for transportation and vertical construction projects including construction management. Also currently included in PM are 2016 acquisitions of Sebesta and Dade Moeller.  
     
   Components of Income and Expense    
     
    Revenues     
     
   We enter into contracts with our clients that contain two principal types of pricing provisions: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The majority of our contracts are cost-reimbursable contracts that fall under the relatively low-risk subcategory of time and materials contracts.   
     
   Cost-reimbursable contracts . Cost-reimbursable contracts consist of two similar contract types: time and materials contracts and cost-plus contracts.   

Time and materials contracts are common for smaller scale professional and technical consulting and certification services projects. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined fee. Instead, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based upon actual hours expended on a project. In addition, any direct project expenditures are passed through to the client and are typically reimbursed. These contracts may have a fixed-price element in the form of an initial not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provision.      

Cost-plus contracts are the predominant contracting method used by U.S. federal, state, and local governments. These contracts provide for reimbursement of the actual costs and overhead (predetermined rates) we incur, plus a predetermined fee. Under some cost-plus contracts, our fee may be based on quality, schedule, and other performance factors.      

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cost-reimbursable contracts represented approximately 86% and 93%, respectively, of our total revenues.   
     
   Fixed-price contracts .   
     
  Fixed-price contracts also consist of two contract types: lump-sum contracts and fixed-unit price contracts.   

Lump-sum contracts typically require the performance of all of the work under the contract for a specified lump-sum fee, subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen conditions arise. Many of our lump-sum contracts are negotiated and arise in the design of projects with a specified scope and project deliverables.      

Fixed-unit price contracts typically require the performance of an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed.      

25

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 14% and 7%, respectively, of our total revenues.   
     
  Revenues from engineering services are recognized in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues under cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized when services are performed and revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, generally measured by the direct costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total direct costs for each contract.   
     
          Direct Costs of Revenues     
     
  Direct costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages incurred in connection with fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. Additionally, payroll taxes, bonuses, and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel, facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization are included in operating expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of revenues. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.   
     
    Operating Expenses     
     
  Operating expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs, other marketing expenses, management and administrative personnel costs, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of revenues for those employees who provide our services. Operating expenses also include facility costs, depreciation and amortization, professional services, legal and accounting fees, and administrative operating costs. We expense operating costs when incurred.   

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act )   

We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act, and could remain for up to five years. We will utilize certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. For example, we will not have to provide an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The JOBS Act also permits us, as an  emerging growth company,  to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have chosen to  opt out  of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by issuers. This decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable.   
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    

The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those discussed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted when necessary. The more significant estimates affecting amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value estimates used in accounting for business combinations including the valuation of identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration, fair value estimates in determining the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill impairment assessment, revenue recognition on the percentage-of-completion method, allowances for uncollectible accounts and provision for income taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not experience any significant changes in estimates or judgments inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations    

Consolidated Results of Operations    
     
  The following table represents our condensed results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):   

___________________________________________________  

(1)        
 
      Net Revenues is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. G  ross revenues include sub-consultant costs and other direct costs which are generally pass-through costs. The Company believes that Net Revenues, which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry, which enhances investors  ability to analyze our business trends and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by our employees.     

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
       
   Gross and Net Revenues .   
     
  Our consolidated gross revenues increased approximately $11,390 and $48,553 or approximately 23.4% and 43.2%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Our consolidated net revenues increased approximately $9,543 and $41,524 or approximately 24.9% and 46.7%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases in gross and net revenues are due primarily to organic growth from our existing platform as well as the contribution from various acquisitions completed in 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in gross revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes gross revenues of $12,363 and $27,363, respectively, related to acquisitions closed during 2016. The increase in net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes net revenues of $11,398 and $24,945, respectively, related to acquisitions closed during 2016. Also contributing to the increases in net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is an increased utilization of our billable employees and reduction of sub-consultants used to perform services in 2016. The growth in revenues was primarily attributable to increases in energy distribution services; construction materials testing and engineering services; and program and construction management services. However, the increases in gross and net revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by reductions in revenues related to the short-term project delays in from infrastructure projects and slowdown in our pipeline transmission business. We are currently unaware of any long-term delays in current projects and therefore are not anticipating such to influence future revenues. Such revenues could be affected by changes in economic conditions and the impact thereof on our public and quasi-public sector funded projects.   

27

Gross Profit .   
     
  As a percentage of gross revenues, our gross profit margin was 46.0% and 44.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a percentage of gross revenues, our gross profit margin was 47.7% and 44.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improved gross profit margins were due primarily to reduction of sub-consultants used to perform services. Gross profit includes direct costs of contracts such as direct labor and all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of sub-consultant costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both gross revenues and costs. To the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass-through costs in a period, our direct costs of contracts are likely to increase as well.  

Operating expenses .   
     
  Our operating expenses increased approximately $5,597 and $23,008, or 33.7% and 57.1%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases in operating expenses were due primarily to integration costs from businesses acquired subsequent to September 30, 2015. The increases in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, include operating expenses of $5,851 and $13,273, respectively, related to acquisitions closed during 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, acquisition related expenses were approximately $8 and $439, respectively, compared to approximately $327 and $716, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Also contributing to the increase in operating costs is the increased amortization of intangible assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of intangible assets was approximately $1,189 and $3,077, respectively, compared to $791 and $1,877, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Operating expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in headcount (both corporate and field locations) and the amount of spending required to support our professional services activities, which normally require additional overhead costs. Therefore, when our professional services revenues increase or decrease, it is not unusual to see a corresponding change in operating expenses.   
     
         Income taxes.   
       
  Our consolidated effective income tax rate was 36.9% and 36.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Our consolidated effective income tax rate was 38.3% and 37.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the combined statutory federal and state income tax rate of approximately 39.0% is principally due to the federal domestic production activities deduction.

Segment Results of Operations    
     
  The following tables set forth summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments   (dollars in thousands):  

(1) Includes amortization of intangibles of $1,189 and $791 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2016, respectively, and $3,077 and $1,877 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
       
    Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
     
  Our gross revenues from INF reportable segment increased approximately $825 and $18,204, or 3.1% and 29.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in revenues for the three and nine months ended reflects increases in energy distribution services and transportation services and the acquisition of RBA in 2015, partially offset by reductions in gross revenues related to the slowdown in our pipeline transmission business.  
     
  Segment Income Before Taxes from INF increased $100 and increased $3,679, or 2.7% and 48.6%,   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were primarily due to increased revenues from organic growth, contributions from acquisitions completed in 2015 for a full period in 2016 as well as a reduction of sub-consultants used to perform services.  
     
  Our gross revenues from CQA reportable segment decreased approximately $356 and increased $2,259, or 4.3% and 10.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The growth in revenues from CQA was primarily attributable to increases in construction materials testing and engineering services partially offset by reductions in revenues from environmental engineering services.  
     
  Segment Income Before Taxes from CQA decreased $152 and increased $362, or 8.6% and 9.5%,   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These changes were primarily due to the changes in revenues for the respective periods as well as reductions of sub-consultants used to perform services.  

29

Our gross revenues from PM reportable segment increased approximately $12,168 and $30,707, or 91.7% and 99.6%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $12,363 and $27,363, respectively, related to acquisitions closed during 2016. Excluding revenues from acquisitions closed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenues from PM decreased approximately $195 and increased $3,226, or 1.5% and 10.5%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The growth in revenues from PM was primarily attributable to increases in civil and facilities program management and construction management services, partially offset by reductions during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in revenues from program management services for transportation projects.  
     
  Segment Income Before Taxes from PM increased $1,731 and $2,975, or 64.7% and 43.0% f  or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flow from operations, lines of credit, and access to financial markets. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, and acquisition expenditures. We believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, which include proceeds from our initial public offering, proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in connection therewith, proceeds from our secondary offerings, and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We will monitor our capital requirements thereafter to ensure our needs are in line with available capital resources.   
     
  We believe our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel have been and will remain critical to our success. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to increase client contact within their areas of expertise and to expand our business within our service offerings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize, in the balance sheet, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. The amendments in this accounting standard update are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.   We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-02 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

33

In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . As part of FASB's accounting simplification initiative, ASU 2015-17 removes the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. Instead, the update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with prospective or retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of this ASU to be material to its consolidated financial statements.   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a   customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU and management has not yet determined which method it will apply. In July 2015, FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date to December 31, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. As a result, ASU 2014 will become effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on the Company's consolidated net income, financial position and cash flows.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   
     
  We are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business. We have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We have no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of our debt is currently financed with fixed interest   rates. Our only debt subject to interest rate risk is the Credit Facility which interest rate is subject to changes in the prime rate. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $0. As result, we believe our market risk is minimal.
