Note 1   Summary of Business and Basis of Presentation  

Nature of Business   

Energy West was originally incorporated
in Montana in 1909 and was reorganized as a holding company in 2009. On July 9, 2010, we changed our name to Gas Natural Inc.
(the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) and reincorporated in Ohio. In October 2015
we implemented a plan of reorganization and formed a new holding company, PHC Utilities, Inc., an Ohio Corporation, that is the
parent company of our regulated utility subsidiaries, Cut Bank Gas, EWM, Frontier Gas, Bangor Gas, NEO, Brainard, Orwell, and
Spelman. We are a natural gas company with operations in four states. Gas Natural is the parent company of Energy West Propane,
Inc., EWR, GNR, Lone Wolfe, PHC and Independence. PHC Utilities, Inc. is the parent company of multiple entities that are natural
gas utility companies with regulated operations in Maine, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio. EWR is a natural gas marketing and
production company with non-regulated operations in Montana. GNR is a natural gas marketing company that markets gas in Ohio.
Energy West Propane, Inc. distributes propane with non-regulated operations in Montana. Lone Wolfe serves as an insurance agent
for us. We have three operating and reporting segments: 

Natural
                                         Gas.  Representing the majority of our revenue, we annually distribute approximately
                                         21 Bcf of natural gas through regulated utilities operating in Maine, Montana, North
                                         Carolina and Ohio. Our natural gas utility subsidiaries include Bangor Gas (Maine), Brainard
                                         (Ohio), Cut Bank Gas (Montana), EWM (Montana), Frontier Gas (North Carolina), NEO (Ohio)
                                         and Orwell (Ohio). As of September 30, 2016, we served approximately 68,600 customers.   

Marketing
                                         and Production.  Annually, we market approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas to
                                         commercial and industrial customers in Montana, Wyoming and Ohio through our EWR and
                                         GNR subsidiaries. Our EWR subsidiary also manages midstream supply and production assets
                                         for transportation customers and utilities. EWR owns or manages, an average 55% gross
                                         working interest (average 46% net revenue interest) in 160 natural gas producing wells
                                         and gas gathering assets located in Glacier and Toole Counties in Montana.      

Corporate
                                         and Other.  Corporate and other encompasses the results of our equity transactions
                                         and discontinued operations. Included in corporate and other are costs associated with
                                         business development and acquisitions, dividend income, recognized gains or losses from
                                         the sale of marketable securities, and the results of our discontinued operations from
                                         the sales of EWW, the Shoshone and Glacier pipelines, and Independence.   

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Gas Natural Inc. have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim
financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not contain all disclosures
required by U.S. GAAP. In our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary to fairly present the
results of operations for the interim periods. 

Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016. A majority of our revenue is derived from natural gas utility operations, making revenue seasonal in
nature. Therefore, the largest portion of our operating revenue is generated during the colder months of the year when our sales
volumes increase considerably. Reference should be made to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
( Annual Report ). 

There have been
no material changes in our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the
significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report. 

Reclassifications  

Certain reclassifications of prior year
reported amounts have been made for comparative purposes. We do not consider such reclassifications to be material and they had
no effect on net income.

Accounting Pronouncement Adopted  

As of January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU
2015-3,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the
balance sheet as a reduction of the associated debt liability. This standard requires retrospective application, and as such,
we reclassified $302 of debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to a reduction of our notes payable in our Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. ASU 2015-3 did not address the presentation of debt issue costs related to
line of credit arrangements, and the SEC staff subsequently issued an announcement that the SEC would not object to the presentation
of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements as an asset. As such, our debt issue costs related to our line of
credit arrangements continue to be presented in other non-current assets. See  Note 7 - Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt
 for additional information regarding our debt issuance costs. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which clarifies the treatment of several types of cash receipts
and payments for which there was diversity in practice. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We
anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting , to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of this newly issued guidance to our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases , which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of
key information about leasing arrangements. The standard will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using
a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial
statements and whether we will adopt the guidance early. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five
step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition
process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and is to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods, with early application not permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2   Discontinued Operations  

The following table reconciles the carrying amounts of the
major line items constituting the pretax income (loss) from discontinued operations to the after-tax income (loss) from discontinued
operations that are presented on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

EWW and the Glacier and Shoshone Pipelines  

On October 10, 2014, we executed a stock
purchase agreement for the sale of all of the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, EWW, to Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company
( Cheyenne ). EWW has historically been included in our natural gas operations segment. In conjunction with this sale,
our former EWD subsidiary entered into an asset purchase agreement for the sale of the transmission pipeline system known as the
Shoshone Pipeline and the gathering pipeline system known as the Glacier Pipeline and certain other assets directly used in the
operation of the pipelines (together the  Pipeline Assets ) to Black Hills Exploration and Production, Inc. ( Black
Hills ), an affiliate of Cheyenne. The Pipeline Assets have historically comprised the entirety of our pipeline segment.
As a result of EWW and the Pipeline Assets  classification as discontinued operations, their results have been included
in our corporate and other segment for all periods presented. On July 1, 2015, we completed a sale of all of the stock of our
wholly-owned subsidiary, EWW, to Cheyenne and we received proceeds, net of costs to sell, of $14,223 for the sale of EWW and $1,185
for the sale of the Pipeline Assets. In connection with our sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of
2015 we committed to repay $4,500 of notes payable to Allstate/CUNA that was allocated to EWW and EWD on February 12, 2016, plus
a prepayment penalty of $310 that was recognized in discontinued operations, net of tax during the fourth quarter of 2015. During
the first quarter of 2016 we adjusted our estimate of the prepayment penalty by $29, which was recognized within discontinued
operations, net of tax in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. See  Note 7   Credit Facilities
and Long-Term Debt  for more information regarding our debt agreements. 

Our subsidiary, EWR, continues to conduct
some business with both EWW and Black Hills relating to the Pipeline Assets. EWW will continue to purchase natural gas from EWR
under an established gas purchase agreement through the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, EWR will continue to use EWW s
transmission system under a standing transportation agreement through the first quarter of 2017. Finally, EWR will continue to
use the Pipeline Assets  transmission systems under a standing transportation agreement through October 2017. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded revenue in our income from continuing operations of $685 and $2,586
respectively from Black Hills for gas and transportation under these ongoing agreements. These transactions are a continuation
of transactions that were conducted prior to the sales of EWW and the Pipeline Assets and were eliminated through the consolidation
process until their sale to third parties.

Note 3   Earnings Per Share  

We compute basic earnings per share by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, there were 1,868 and 102, respectively, shares that would have been anti-dilutive and were therefore
excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. There were no shares or share equivalents that would have been anti-dilutive
and therefore excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the other periods presented. Unvested restricted stock
awards are treated as participating securities because they participate equally in dividends and earnings with other common shares. 

Note 4   Fair Value Measurements  

We follow a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to measurements involving
unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level
1 inputs - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs - other inputs
that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 

Level 3 inputs - unobservable
inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 

We categorize our fair value measurements
within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The following
table presents the amount and level in the fair value hierarchy of each of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

  (in thousands, except share and per
share amounts ) 

The fair value of our financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, notes and accounts receivable, and notes and accounts payable are not materially different
from their carrying amounts. Under the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents is classified as a Level
1 measurement and the fair value of notes payable are classified as Level 2 measurements.

We value our commodity swap contracts,
which are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, by comparing the futures price at the measurement date of the natural
gas commodity specified in the contract to the fixed price that we will pay. See  Note 5   Derivative Financial Instruments
 for more information regarding our commodity swap contracts. 

Contingent Consideration Liability  

The contingent consideration liability
categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy arose as a result of a purchase agreement, pursuant to which we acquired the
assets of our GNR subsidiary in 2013. The purchase agreement for the transaction provided for contingent  earn-out 
payments in the form of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of our common stock for a period of five years after
the closing of the transaction if the acquired business achieved a minimum annual EBITDA target of $810. If the acquired business s
actual EBITDA for a given year is less than the target EBITDA, then no earn-out payment is due and payable for that period. If
the acquired business s actual EBITDA for a given year meets or exceeds the target EBITDA, then an earn-out payment in an
amount equal to actual EBITDA divided by target EBITDA multiplied by $575 will have been earned for that year. 

We recorded a liability for an earn-out
payment for the year ended December 31, 2013. We did not believe an earn-out payment was due to JDOG Marketing as a result of
payments made by the Ohio utilities to JDOG Marketing during 2013 that were disallowed by the PUCO. Richard Osborne, our former
chairman and chief executive officer, believed that JDOG Marketing was entitled to the earn-out. Richard Osborne and JDOG Marketing
filed a suit against us for the earn-out payment for 2013. During the second quarter of 2016, we settled the suit and recorded
a gain of $672 on the resolution of the liability because the earn-out provision of the purchase agreement was nullified and no
amounts are payable related to the earn-out. See  Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  for more information about
the litigation between us and Richard Osborne.

Note 5   Derivative Financial
Instruments  

We enter into commodity swap contracts
in order to reduce the commodity price risk related to natural gas prices. These commodity swap contracts set a fixed price that
we will pay for specified notional quantities of natural gas. We have not designated any of these commodity swap contracts as
hedging instruments. 

The following table summarizes our commodity
swap contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2016. We will pay the fixed price listed based on the volumes denoted in the table
below in exchange for a variable payment from a counterparty based on the market price for the natural gas product listed for
these volumes. These payments are settled monthly. 

We included in cost of sales in the accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, $316 and $2,948 of losses on commodity swap agreements not designated as hedging
instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, related to our regulated utilities. Our regulated utilities
did not have any swap agreements during the first nine months of 2016. Losses/(gains) on commodity swap agreements not designated
as hedging instruments for non-regulated subsidiaries were $48 and $16 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $(46) and $(120) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which amounts are included
in cost of sales in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we included $66 and $(54), respectively, of assets (liabilities) related to commodity swap agreements that are not designated
as hedging instruments in derivative instruments in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7   Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt   

During the second quarter of 2016, nearly
all of our long-term notes payable became due within one year. These notes payable are presented on the September 30, 2016 balance
sheets as long-term balances because on October 19, 2016, we refinanced those long-term debt agreements with an issuance of $50,000
of senior notes.  Additionally, we established a $42,000 five-year revolving credit facility. In our September 30, 2016,
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, we have reclassified the short term portion of our borrowings because they were refinanced
before these financial statements were issued. See  Note 15   Subsequent Events  for further details regarding our
new debt agreements.  Upon closing, proceeds from the new debt arrangements replaced our six previously existing loan facilities.
The following table presents our outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The weighted average interest rate on
our outstanding short term borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was 3.34% and 2.80%, respectively,
and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was 3.04% and 3.00%, respectively. The weighted average interest
rate on our short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was 3.32% and 2.71%, respectively. 

Bank of America  

As of September 30, 2016 our Energy West
subsidiary had a credit facility with Bank of America ( Credit Facility ) that provided for a revolving line of credit
with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30,000 due April 1, 2017. This revolving line of credit included an annual commitment fee
ranging from 25 to 45 basis points of the unused portion of the facility and accrued interest based on our option of two indices:
(1) a base rate, which is defined as a daily rate based on the highest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds Rate plus
50 basis points, or (z) the daily LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, or (2) LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points. At September 30,
2016, we had $1,200 of base rate borrowings and at December 31, 2015, we did not have any base rate borrowings. The weighted average
outstanding interest rate on our revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was 2.40% and 2.17%,
respectively. After considering outstanding letters of credit of $164, a total of $11,586 was available to us for loans and letters
of credit under the revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2016. 

In addition, Energy West had a $10,000
term loan with Bank of America with a maturity date of April 1, 2017 (the  Term Loan ). The Term Loan portion
of the Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points and contained an interest rate swap provision
that allowed for the interest rate to be fixed in the future. The Term Loan amortized at a rate of $125 per quarter. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Term Loan bore interest at 2.27% and 2.17%, respectively, and had a balance of $8,000 and
$8,375 respectively.

The Bank of America revolving credit agreement
and Term Loan contained various covenants, which required that Energy West and its subsidiaries maintained compliance with a number
of financial covenants, including a limitation on investments in another entity by acquisition of any debt or equity securities
or assets or by making loans or advances to such entity. In addition, Energy West was required to maintain a total debt to total
capital ratio of not more than 0.55-to-1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.0-to-1.0. The Bank of America agreements
established limits on Energy West s ability to incur additional borrowings, pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock, consummate
a merger or acquisition and dispose of assets. See  Note 15   Subsequent Events  for further details regarding our
new debt agreements. 

NIL Funding  

On April 15, 2016, we entered into a loan
agreement and promissory note for $4,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we made monthly interest payments,
based on an annual rate of 7.5% and the principal balance of the note would have been due upon maturity on November 15, 2016.
The note and loan agreement were subject to other customary loan covenants and default provisions. In an event of default, as
defined under the loan agreement, NIL Funding could have, at its option, required us to immediately pay the outstanding principal
balance of the note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to
shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day s closing price on the NYSE MKT. NIL Funding
is a related party of ours. See  Note 12   Related Party Transactions  for further details regarding our related party
transactions. See  Note 15   Subsequent Events  for further details regarding our new debt agreements. 

On October 23, 2015, we entered into a
loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding made a loan
to us that bore an annual interest rate of 6.95%, and had a maturity date of April 20, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the NIL
Funding loan had an outstanding balance of $2,000. On March 14, 2016, the NIL Funding credit facility was paid off and extinguished.
NIL Funding is a related party of ours. See  Note 12   Related Party Transactions  for further details about our relationship
with NIL Funding. 

Allstate/CUNA  

In connection with our sale of EWW and
the Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to repay the portion of the Notes that were allocated to EWW
and EWD on February 12, 2016, in the amount of $4,500, plus a prepayment penalty of $310 that was recognized in discontinued operations,
net of tax during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2016 we adjusted our estimate of the prepayment penalty
by $29, which was recognized within discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Operations. See  Note 2   Discontinued Operations  for more information regarding our discontinued operations. 

The Notes were an obligation of Energy
West. The Notes contained various covenants, including a limitation on Energy West s total dividends and distributions made
in the immediately preceding 60-month period to 100% of aggregate consolidated net income for such period. The Notes restricted
Energy West from incurring additional senior indebtedness in excess of 65% of capitalization at any time and required Energy West
to maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than 150% of the pro forma annual interest charges on a consolidated basis in two
of the three preceding fiscal years. See  Note 15   Subsequent Events  for further details regarding our new debt agreements. 

Sun Life  

The Sun Life Fixed Rate Note ( Fixed
Rate Note ) was a joint obligation of Gas Natural, NEO, Orwell and Brainard, and was guaranteed by Gas Natural, Lightning
Pipeline and Great Plains (the  Obligors ). The Fixed Rate Note was governed by a note purchase agreement. Under the
note purchase agreement, we were required to make monthly interest payments and the principal was due at maturity. Prepayment
of this note prior to maturity was subject to a 50 basis point make-whole premium. See  Note 15   Subsequent Events 
for further details regarding our new debt agreements. 

The Sun Life senior secured guaranteed
note was a joint obligation of NEO, Orwell, and Brainard and was guaranteed by our non-regulated Ohio subsidiaries. 

The Sun Life covenants restricted certain
cash balances and required a debt service reserve account to be maintained to cover approximately one year of interest payments.
The total balance in the debt service reserve account was $948 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and was included in
restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt service reserve account could not be used for operating
cash needs. The Sun Life agreements established limits on the Obligors  ability to incur additional borrowings, pay dividends,
redeem or repurchase stock, consummate a merger or acquisition and dispose of assets. Generally, we could consummate a merger
or consolidation if there was no event of default and the provisions of the notes were assumed by the surviving or continuing
entity. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would have required us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance
of the notes as well as any and all interest and other payments due. An event of default would also have entitled Sun Life to
exercise certain rights with respect to any collateral that secured the indebtedness incurred under the Sun Life notes.

The Sun Life covenants required, on a
consolidated basis, an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The
notes generally defined the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest expense. The Sun Life notes also
required that we not permit indebtedness to exceed 60% of capitalization at any time. The interest coverage ratio and the debt
to capitalization ratio were measured with respect to the Obligors on a consolidated basis and also with respect to us and all
of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

Note 8   Stock Compensation  

2012 Incentive and Equity Award Plan  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $29 and $31 of compensation expense, related to 3,894 and 3,471 shares of common stock, respectively,
and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $89 and $120 of compensation expense related to 11,994
and 12,305 shares of our common stock, respectively, that were earned by the then current directors of Gas Natural under the 2012
Incentive and Equity Award Plan. The awards were not conditional on any future performance or event and as such, were fully expensed
on the grant date. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $5 and $15, of compensation expense related to the vesting of restricted shares awarded
under the 2012 Incentive and Equity Award Plan. These shares vest ratably on July 21, 2015, 2016, and 2017. During the vesting
period, each restricted share has the same rights to dividend distributions and voting as any other common share. 

Note 9   Employee Benefit Plans  

We have a defined contribution plan (the
 401k Plan ) that covers substantially all of our employees. The plan provides for an annual contribution of 3% of
all employees  salaries and an additional contribution of 10% of each participant s elective deferrals, which until
July 1, 2016, was invested in shares of our common stock under the 401k Plan. Contributions after July 1, 2016, are made based
on each participant s investment allocation. We recognized $117 and $114 of contributions to the 401k Plan for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $364 and $352 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

We sponsored a defined postretirement
health benefit plan (the  Retiree Health Plan ) providing Medicare supplement benefits to eligible retirees. We discontinued
contributions in 2006 and are no longer required to fund the Retiree Health Plan. The Retiree Health Plan pays eligible retirees
(post-65 years of age) a monthly stipend toward eligible Medicare supplement payments. The amount of this payment is fixed and
will not increase with medical trends or inflation. The amounts available for retirement supplement payments are currently held
in a VEBA trust account, and benefits for this plan are paid from assets held in the VEBA Trust account. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the value of plan assets was $86 and $102, respectively. The assets remaining in the trust will be used
to fund the plan until these assets are exhausted, at which time the plan will be terminated.

Note 10   Lease Agreement  

Upon completion of the final phase of
our ERP system implementation project during the first quarter of 2016, we determined that the lease of the ERP system qualifies
for sales recognition under sale-leaseback accounting guidance and that the lease governing our future use of the assets is a
capital lease. Accordingly, we recorded property, plant and equipment and a capital lease liability of $1,672, based on the present
value of our minimum lease payments. We removed the build-to-suit liability and the related assets from our condensed consolidated
balance sheets and we deferred a loss on the sale of the software assets of $1,196 that will be amortized ratably over the thirty
month life of the lease. The deferred loss represents the difference between the fair value of that property and the amount financed
in the sale-leaseback transaction. Based on the nature of the transaction, the fair value of the property leased was determined
to be the costs capitalized. We will make lease payments of $58 per month over the thirty month term of the lease related to this
phase three of the ERP implementation project. Our total lease payments related to our ERP implementation project, including the
leases that we entered during 2015, will be $294 through 2017 and will decline in 2018 as each of the leases reach the end of
their respective term. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had capital lease obligations of $5,755 and $6,379,
respectively, and unamortized deferred losses on the sale-leaseback of our ERP system of $2,065 and $1,679. See  Note 14  
Commitments and Contingencies  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report for more
information about our ERP system leases.

Note 12   Related Party Transactions  

Relationships with Richard Osborne  

Historically we engaged in various related
party transactions with entities owned or controlled by our former chairman and chief executive officer, Richard Osborne. After
Richard Osborne s removal as chief executive officer on May 1, 2014, the board took a measured approach to reduce or terminate,
as appropriate, related party transactions with Richard Osborne while ensuring that we continue to serve our customers affected
by such transactions. These efforts were made in furtherance of our long-term plan to phase out related party transactions. We
made purchases of natural gas and transportation services from entities owned or controlled by Richard Osborne of $377 and $433,
respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1,584 and $2,146, respectively, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We incurred rent expense related to entities owned or controlled by Richard Osborne
of $6 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $2 and $20, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. We did not rent any facilities from entities owned or controlled by Richard Osborne during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. We sold natural gas to entities owned or controlled by Richard Osborne of $2 during the three months ended
September 30, 2015, and $6 and $28, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did
not sell natural gas to any entities owned or controlled by Richard Osborne during the three months ended September 30, 2016.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized rental income of $8 from entities owned or controlled by Richard
Osborne. We did not earn rental income from related parties in any other period presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we had accounts receivable of $14 and $188, respectively, due from companies owned or controlled by Richard Osborne.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had accounts payable of $47 and $192, respectively, due to companies owned
or controlled by Richard Osborne.

31, 2015, respectively, which were not yet invoiced. The related expense is included in the gas purchased line item in the accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded $2,908 to establish an accrual
payable to related parties for the settlement of certain pending legal matters between us and Richard Osborne, of which, $2,000
was paid during the third quarter of 2016. See  Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  for further details regarding
our legal matters. 

In addition, we had related party natural
gas imbalances of $174 and $256 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which were included in our natural
gas inventory balance. These amounts represent quantities of natural gas due to us from natural gas transportation companies controlled
by Richard Osborne. 

Relationship with NIL Funding  

NIL Funding is an affiliate of The InterTech
Group, Inc. ( InterTech ). The chairperson and chief executive officer of InterTech is Anita G. Zucker. Mrs. Zucker,
as trustee of the Article 6 Marital Trust, under the First Amended and Restated Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust dated April 2, 2007,
beneficially owned 1,040,640 shares, or 9.89%, of our outstanding common stock, as of May 18, 2016. Two members of our Board of
Directors, Robert Johnston and Michael Bender, also currently serve as executive vice president and chief strategy officer and
director, corporate secretary and corporate counsel, respectively, of InterTech. See  Note 7 -     Credit Facilities
and Long-Term Debt    for more information about our transactions with NIL Funding. 

On April 15, 2016, we entered into a loan
agreement and promissory note for $4,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we made monthly interest payments
to NIL Funding, based on an annual rate of 7.5% and the principal balance of the note would have been due upon maturity on November
15, 2016. On October 19, 2016, we paid the balance of this note payable with the proceeds from our senior notes and revolving
credit agreement. See  Note 15- Subsequent Events  for more information about our new credit facilities. The note and loan
agreements were subject to other customary loan covenants and default provisions. In an event of default, as defined under the
loan agreement, NIL Funding could have, at its option, required us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the
note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to shares of our
common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day s closing price on the NYSE MKT. See  Note 7   Credit
Facilities and Long-Term Debt  for more information regarding our credit facilities. 

Note 13   Segment Reporting  

Our reportable
segments are based on our method of internal reporting, which generally segregates the strategic business units due to differences
in services and regulation. We separate our state regulated utility businesses from non-regulated marketing and production businesses,
and our corporate level operations. We have regulated natural gas utility businesses in the states of Maine, Montana, North Carolina
and Ohio that form our natural gas segment. We have non-regulated natural gas marketing and production businesses in Montana and
Ohio   that together form our marketing and production segment. Our corporate operations, our
Lone Wolf insurance subsidiary, and our discontinued operations together form our corporate and other segment. Transactions between
reportable segments are accounted for on an accrual basis, and are eliminated. Intercompany eliminations between segments consist
primarily of gas sales from the marketing and production operations to the natural gas operations, intercompany accounts receivable
and payable, equity, and investments in subsidiaries.   

The following tables set forth summarized financial information
for our natural gas, marketing and production, and corporate and other operations segments for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we are involved in
lawsuits and other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We are contesting each of these lawsuits
vigorously and believe we have defenses to the allegations that have been made. 

Shareholders Suit  

Beginning on December 10, 2013, five putative
shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed by five different individuals, in their capacity as our shareholders, in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, purportedly on behalf of us and naming certain of our current and former
executive officers and directors as individual defendants. These five shareholder lawsuits are captioned as follows: (1) Richard
J. Wickham v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:13-cv-02718-LW); (2) John Durgerian v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case
No. 1:13-cv-02805-LW); (3) Joseph Ferrigno v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:13-cv-02822-LW); (4) Kyle Warner v. Richard
M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:14-cv-00007-LW) and (5) Gary F. Peters v. Richard M. Osborne, (Case No. 1:14-cv-0026-CAB). On
February 6, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated solely for purposes of conducting limited pretrial discovery, and on February
21, 2014, the Court appointed lead counsel for all five lawsuits. The parties are currently conducting discovery in this lawsuit. 

The consolidated action contains claims
against various of our current or former directors or officers alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities
laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment arising primarily out of our acquisition of
the Ohio utilities, services provided by JDOG Marketing and the acquisition of JDOG Marketing, and the sale of our common stock
by Richard Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer, and Thomas J. Smith, our former chief financial officer.
The suit, in which we are named as a nominal defendant, seeks the recovery of unspecified damages allegedly sustained by us, corporate
reforms, disgorgement, restitution, the recovery of plaintiffs  attorney s fees and other relief. 

We, along with the other defendants, filed
a motion to dismiss the consolidated action in its entirety on May 8, 2014. The motion to dismiss was based on, among other things,
the failure of the plaintiffs to make a demand on our board of directors to address the alleged wrongdoing prior to filing their
lawsuits and the failure to state viable claims against various individual defendants. Richard Osborne, individually, is now represented
by counsel independent of all other defendants in the case and submitted a filing in support of the motion to dismiss on his own
behalf. 

On September 24, 2014, the magistrate
judge assigned to the case issued a report and recommendation in response to the motion to dismiss. The magistrate judge recommended
that the plaintiffs  claims against the individual defendants with respect to the  unjust enrichment  allegation
in the complaint be dismissed. The magistrate judge recommended that all other portions of the motion to dismiss be denied. On
June 4, 2015, the trial judge assigned to the case adopted in full the report and recommendation, the objections filed by the
defendants, and the responses from the plaintiffs. The parties are currently engaged in ongoing settlement discussions. 

At this time we are unable to provide
an estimate of any possible future losses that we may incur in connection to this suit. We carry insurance that we believe will
cover any negative outcome associated with this action. This insurance carries a $250 deductible, which we have reached. Although
we believe these insurance proceeds are available, we may incur costs and expenses related to this suit that are not covered by
insurance which may be substantial. Any unfavorable outcome could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

                                         County Court of Common Pleas. Mr. Osborne sought an order requiring us to provide him
                                         with meeting minutes and corporate resolutions for the past five years. On February 13,
                                         2015, Mr. Osborne voluntarily dismissed his complaint. On April 28, 2015, Mr. Osborne
                                         refiled this lawsuit in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. We filed a counterclaim
                                         against Mr. Osborne seeking to have him declared a vexatious litigator. Pursuant to the
                                         Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         28, 2014:  Mr. Osborne (1) demanded payment of an earn-out amount associated with
                                         our purchase of assets from JDOG Marketing, (2) alleged that our board of directors breached
                                         its fiduciary duties by removing Mr. Osborne as chairman and chief executive officer,
                                         (3) sought to enforce a July 15, 2014, term sheet, where the parties memorialized certain
                                         discussions they had in connection with their efforts to resolve the dispute arising
                                         out of the lawsuit, which included a severance payment of $1,000, and (4) sought to invalidate
                                         the results of the July 30, 2014, shareholder meeting and asked the court to order us
                                         to hold a new meeting at a later date. Mr. Osborne also sought compensatory and punitive
                                         damages. We asserted counterclaims including claims for defamation, arising out of the
                                         July 9, 2014, letter Mr. Osborne sent to our shareholders and conversion for a company-provided
                                         car Mr. Osborne refuses to return to us. Additional counterclaims included claims for
                                         battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, asserted by Wade Brooksby and

                                         its vehicles via GPS monitoring. Cobra alleged that we, and other defendants, accessed
                                         and intercepted vehicle tracking data, after we knew or should have known that our authority

                                         that Richard Osborne, while the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Orwell,
                                         Great Plains, JDOG, and GNSC fraudulently presented demands for payment to GNSC and Orwell,
                                         claiming that payments were due for natural gas purchased from Great Plains and JDOG
                                         from January 2012 through September 2013. Mr. Osborne ultimately obtained two checks
                                         from Orwell in the total amount of $202. Orwell s complaint stated a claim of theft
                                         and sought liquidated damages in the amount of these checks. Pursuant to the Settlement,
                                         this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         Natural Gas Company v. Ohio Rural Natural Gas Co-Op, et al. , Case No. 15CV002063,
                                         filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Lake County, Ohio on November 30, 2015:  Orwell
                                         filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction against Ohio Rural Natural Gas
                                         Co-Op (Ohio Rural) and Mr. Osborne alleging that Ohio Rural and Mr. Osborne acted in
                                         concert to convert, for the use of their own supply, natural gas supply lines owned and
                                         operated by Orwell. The complaint alleged that on November 20, 2015, Ohio Rural and Mr.
                                         Osborne tampered with and severed gas lines owned by Orwell on Tin Man Road in Mentor,
                                         Ohio, terminated its service to approximately 50 independently owned businesses, and
                                         converted it for their own personal use. The complaint stated claims for conversion,
                                         unjust enrichment and civil remedy against criminal act, and seeks compensatory and liquidated
                                         damages. On November 30, 2015, Orwell filed a case with the PUCO on the same grounds,

Orwell
                                         Natural Gas Company v. Orwell-Trumbull Pipeline Company, LLC , Case Number 15-0475-GA-CSS,
                                         filed with the PUCO on March 9, 2015:  Orwell s complaint alleged that on March
                                         5, 2015, an Orwell-Trumbull employee notified Orwell that a pipeline owned by Orwell-Trumbull
                                         along Vrooman Road in Lake County, Ohio would be shut down completely for an alleged
                                         need to conduct maintenance or move Orwell-Trumbull pipelines. The complaint alleged
                                         that Orwell-Trumbull violated Ohio law due to its improper attempt to shut down the pipeline
                                         along Vrooman Road and requested the PUCO order Orwell-Trumbull to refrain from shutting
                                         off service to the residential and commercial customers along Vrooman Road. On May 9,
                                         2016, Orwell-Trumbull, Orwell and the Ohio Consumers  Counsel filed a stipulation
                                         in which Orwell-Trumbull agreed to provide monthly status updates to the parties to the
                                         stipulation regarding the ownership status of certain pipelines along Vrooman Road. The
                                         monthly updates will be required until Orwell-Trumbull has either completed construction
                                         to re-establish connections or filed a petition to abandon service regarding its pipelines
                                         on Vrooman Road. On June 1, 2016, the PUCO dismissed Orwell s complaint on the
                                         basis that the May 9, 2016, stipulation resolved all of the issues in the complaint.
                                         Pursuant to the Settlement, this case was closed.

                                         provisions in the Agreement. Orwell filed several counterclaims, including claims for
                                         breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Pursuant to the Settlement, this case
                                         was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         filed with the PUCO on March 31, 2015:  On March 31, 2015, Orwell filed a complaint
                                         on the same grounds as Case No: 01-15-0002-9137, described above, with the PUCO to address
                                         issues regarding the operation of and contract rights for utilities on the Orwell Trumbull
                                         Pipeline. The PUCO issued an opinion and order on June 15, 2016, asserting jurisdiction
                                         over the Agreement, modifying certain of its terms, ordering any other pipeline owned
                                         or controlled by Richard Osborne to file a rate case within 60 days of the order, and
                                         ordering the PUCO Staff to undertake an investigative audit of all pipeline companies
                                         owned or controlled by Richard Osborne. Although the parties agreed upon certain conduct
                                         in the interim, under the Settlement Orwell-Trumbull has the right to appeal the June
                                         15, 2016 PUCO opinion and order. Orwell-Trumbull filed a request for a rehearing on July
                                         15, 2016. Orwell filed its memorandum in opposition on July 25, 2016. On August 3, 2016,
                                         Orwell-Trumbull s request for a rehearing was granted.     

Gas
                                         Natural Resources LLC v. Orwell-Trumbull Pipeline Company LLC , Case No. 16-0663-GA-CSS,
                                         filed with the PUCO on March 28, 2016:  GNR filed a complaint before the PUCO pursuant
                                         to a transportation service agreement between it and Orwell-Trumbull. The agreement was
                                         assigned to GNR when we acquired the assets of JDOG Marketing on June 1, 2013. The complaint
                                         alleged that Orwell-Trumbull breached the termination provisions of the agreement and
                                         violated Ohio law due to Orwell-Trumbull s failure to file the agreement with the
                                         PUCO and its improper attempt to discontinue service under agreement. Pursuant to the
                                         Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.   

We and Mr. Osborne further agreed to dismiss
all other pending or threatened litigation matters between us, although not specifically identified in the agreement. In connection
with the Settlement, Mr. Osborne withdrew the director candidates he had nominated for election to our board of directors at the
annual meeting of shareholders held on July 27, 2016. The proxy materials circulated in support of his candidates were also withdrawn.
Pursuant to the Settlement, further details of the Settlement are confidential. See  Note 12   Related Party Transactions

violation of a Montana statute requiring just cause for termination. In addition, he alleges claims for negligent infliction of
emotional distress and negligent slander. Mr. Harrington is seeking relief for economic loss, including lost wages and fringe
benefits for a period of at least four years from the date of discharge, together with interest. Mr. Harrington is an Ohio resident
and was employed in our Ohio corporate offices. On March 20, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that
Mr. Harrington was an Ohio employee, not a Montana employee, and therefore the statute does not apply. On July 1, 2014, the court
conducted a hearing, made extensive findings on the record, and issued an Order finding in our favor and dismissing all of Mr.
Harrington s claims. On July 21, 2014, Mr. Harrington appealed the dismissal to the Montana Supreme Court. On August 11,
2015, the Montana Supreme Court agreed with us that Mr. Harrington s employment was governed by Ohio law, and as such he
could not take advantage of Montana s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act. However, the Montana Supreme Court also held
the trial court erred in determining it lacked jurisdiction over the case, finding the trial court should have retained jurisdiction
and applied Ohio law to Mr. Harrington s claims. As Ohio is an  at will  state, we believe there are no claims
under Ohio law and the case will ultimately be dismissed by the trial court on remand. On September 28, 2015, Mr. Harrington filed
a motion to amend the complaint to assert new causes of action not previously alleged including claims for misrepresentation,
constructive fraud based on alleged representations, slander, and mental pain and suffering. We answered the amended complaint
to preserve our defenses, and we have also opposed Mr. Harrington s motion to amend. On December 14, 2015, we filed a motion
to dismiss the Montana action in its entirety on the basis that the forum is not appropriate. Our motion to dismiss is now fully
briefed and is awaiting ruling by the court. We continue to believe Mr. Harrington s claims under both Montana and Ohio
law are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend this case on all grounds. 

SEC Investigation  

We received a letter from the Chicago
Regional Office of the SEC dated March 3, 2015, stating that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation regarding (i)
audits by the PUCO and Rehmann Corporate Investigative Services, (ii) the determination and calculation of the GCR, (iii) our
financial statements and internal controls, and (iv) various entities affiliated with our former chairman and chief executive
officer, Richard Osborne. On May 29, 2015, we received a subpoena regarding a formal investigation, case number C-08186-A. On
March 15, 2016, we received a second subpoena regarding the same case. The SEC has requested we preserve all documents relating
to these matters. We are complying with this request and intend to cooperate fully with the SEC. 

Note 15   Subsequent Events  

Dividend  

On October 28, 2016, we paid a dividend
of $0.075 to shareholders of record as of October 13, 2016. There were 10,519,728 shares outstanding on October 13, 2016, which
resulted in a dividend of $789 paid. 

Debt Agreements and Restructuring  

On October 19, 2016, we entered into a
Credit Agreement and Revolving Note with Bank of America. The Credit Agreement provides for a $42,000 unsecured revolving credit
facility which incurs variable interest on a grid structure, based on our leverage ratio. The credit facility has a maturity date
of October 19, 2021. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with a number of covenants, including limitations
on incurring additional debt, dispositions and investments, and maintaining a total debt to capital ratio of not more than 0.50
to 1.00, and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement and Revolving Note,
the occurrence and continuation of one or more of the events of default specified in the Credit Agreement would require us to
immediately pay all amounts then remaining unpaid on the Note. 

Also on October 19, 2016, we entered into
a Note Purchase Agreement providing for the issuance and sale to investors in a private placement of $50,000 aggregate principal
amount of our 4.23% Senior Notes, due October 19, 2028. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we issued an unsecured Senior
Note, in the amount of $50,000 held by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, on which we pay interest semiannually.
The Note Purchase Agreement and Senior Note are subject to other customary covenants and default provisions. An occurrence of
an event of default specified in the Note Purchase Agreement would require us to immediately pay all amounts then remaining unpaid
on the Senior Note.

The Revolving Note and Senior Note are
each guaranteed by our wholly owned non-utility subsidiaries, Energy West Propane, Inc., EWR, GNR, Independence, Lone Wolfe, and
PHC. 

Additionally, on October 19, 2016, we
created a wholly-owned PHC subsidiary under which each of our eight regulated entities is held. This streamlines our corporate
structure to facilitate greater focus on the four regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as to simplify our financing
arrangements.  With the new structure, which received regulatory approval, the regulated entities are segregated from non-regulated
operations.  

Agreement and Plan of Merger  

On October 8, 2016, we entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), by and among us, FR Bison Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( Parent ), and FR Bison Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation ( Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger
Sub will merge with and into us (the  Merger ), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement. We will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Parent will pay to our shareholders
$13.10 per common share in cash, without interest (the  Merger Consideration ), in accordance with and subject to
the terms of the Merger Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Fund II, L.P. ( First
Reserve ) and were formed by First Reserve in order to acquire us. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the
effective time of the Merger (the  Effective Time ), each share of our common stock ( GNI Common Stock )
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including restricted shares of GNI Common Stock which will become
fully vested in accordance with their terms) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, other than (i) shares that are held in our treasury or owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of ours, (ii) shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, and (iii) shares held by
shareholders who have complied in all respects with all of the provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law concerning such
shareholder s rights as a dissenting shareholder. First Reserve has committed to capitalize Parent, at or immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger, with an aggregate equity contribution in an amount of up to $137,800, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in an equity commitment letter, dated as of October 8, 2016. 

Our board of directors unanimously determined
that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are in the best interests of us and our stockholders
and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously resolved to recommend that our stockholders
vote in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement. 

We have made customary representations
and warranties in the Merger Agreement and have agreed to customary covenants regarding the operation of our business and our
subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Merger. 

The Merger is
subject to, among other customary closing conditions, the approvals of the MPUC, MPSC, NCUC, and the PUCO.
In addition, the Merger requires the approval of our shareholders and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.  The Merger Agreement also includes certain termination rights for
both us and Parent and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances,
we or Parent will be required to pay to Parent or to us, respectively, a termination fee of $4,800. First Reserve has provided
us with a limited guarantee in favor of us guaranteeing the payment of Parent s termination fee if such amount becomes payable
under the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for a 42-day go shop period which expires November 22, 2016. During
such period, our board of directors, together with our financial and legal advisors, may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and
potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals to acquire us. At the end of the go shop period,
we will cease such activities, and will be subject to a customary no shop provision that restricts our ability to solicit acquisition
proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties
regarding acquisition proposals after the go shop period. The no shop provision also allows us, under certain circumstances and
in compliance with certain obligations, to provide non-public information and engage in discussions and negotiations with respect
to an unsolicited acquisition proposal, including from third parties who initially submitted an acquisition proposal during the
go shop period that constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal.

In addition,
in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder of ours representing approximately 9.9% of our outstanding
shares has entered into a voting agreement (the  Voting Agreement ) with Parent pursuant to which such stockholder
has agreed to vote in favor of the Merger and the approval of the Merger Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in the
Voting Agreement. The obligations under the Voting Agreement will terminate if, among other reasons, the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms. 

Upon consummation
of the Merger, our common stock will be delisted from the NYSE MKT and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. For further details regarding the Merger Agreement, see our preliminary proxy statement filed November

Executive
Overview   

We are a natural gas company, primarily
operating local distribution companies in four states and serving approximately 68,600 customers as of September 30, 2016. Our
natural gas utility subsidiaries are Bangor Gas (Maine), Brainard (Ohio), Cut Bank Gas Company (Montana), EWM (Montana), Frontier
Gas (North Carolina), NEO (Ohio) and Orwell (Ohio). Each of these entities is regulated in their respective states and operates
under tariffs which allow them to collect revenue sufficient to recover their operating costs and earn a reasonable rate of return.
Approximately 79% and 88% of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were derived from
our natural gas utility operations. 

Our operations also include the marketing
and production of natural gas. Our marketing and production subsidiaries are EWR (Montana and Wyoming) and GNR (Ohio). Our marketing
and production subsidiaries obtain gas from interstate pipelines, local producers, and from small production wells in which it
owns an interest. This gas is then sold to regulated utilities, commercial and industrial customers that are the end users of
the commodity. In 2015, our marketing and production subsidiaries marketed approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas in three states. 

As part of this discussion and analysis
of our operating results we refer to increases and decreases in heating degree days. A heating degree day is a measure of coldness
of the weather experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature falls below a reference temperature, usually
65 degrees Fahrenheit. In any given period, sales volumes reflect the impact of weather, in addition to other factors. We do not
have a weather normalization adjustment in our rates and as a result, our revenue is sensitive to fluctuations in temperature.
Colder temperatures generally result in increased sales, while warmer temperatures generally result in reduced sales. 

The following summarizes the critical
events that impacted our results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Revenue
                                         and gross margin in our natural gas operations for the nine months ended September 30,
                                         2016, decreased primarily due to warmer weather across our markets during the first quarter
                                         of 2016, as compared to the first quarter of 2015, which unfavorably impacted our year
                                         to date results. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA )
                                         reported that the last winter, which the NOAA defines as December through February, was
                                         the warmest winter on record for the contiguous United States.   

Revenue
                                         for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was also impacted by the price of natural
                                         gas. The average price experienced during the first nine months of 2016 was approximately
                                         16% lower than the average price during the first nine months of 2015. The cost of natural
                                         gas incurred by our utilities is passed on to our customers.

During
                                         the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses increased primarily as a
                                         result of an increase in legal and professional costs of $348 and IT service costs of
                                         $570 as compared to the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in legal and
                                         professional expenses during 2016 was the result of the settlement of our litigation
                                         with Richard Osborne and costs related to our proxy contest with Richard Osborne, both
                                         of which are non-recurring expenses. The increase in IT service costs during 2016 was
                                         the result of our ERP implementation project.   

Gas
Prices and Revenue    

Due to the price volatility of natural
gas and our ability to pass our cost of gas on to our customers, we believe that revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing
our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in gas prices, our revenue may materially increase
or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in sales volumes or gross margin.
We consider gross margin to be a better measure of comparative performance than revenue. However, gas prices and revenue can impact
our working capital requirements; see   Operating Cash Flow   below. 

Results
of operations   

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report. Results of operations
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be attained for any future period.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016,
Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue   Revenue increased by $271
to $13,355 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13,084 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase of $1,083 in revenue from our marketing and production operations primarily as a result of our sales
of gas to EWW. We divested of EWW during the third quarter of 2015, prior to which any intercompany revenue was eliminated and
included in discontinued operations in the prior year. During the third quarter of 2016, we experienced lower gas prices in our
markets, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase in revenue was also offset by a decrease of $132 in revenue as a
result of the sale of our Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC utilities during the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Gross margin   Gross margin decreased
by $239 to $6,576 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,815 for the same period in 2015. Our natural gas
operation s margins decreased $217, due primarily to the loss of three industrial customers in our Maine market, which was
partially offset by an increase in customer count. Gross margin from our marketing and production operations decreased by $22,
which was primarily the result of reduced gross margin of $52 from our production operations as a result of lower prices, partially
offset by an increase in gross margin of $30 in our marketing operations as a result of customer growth. 

Operating expenses   Operating expenses,
other than cost of sales, increased by $37 to $9,498 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $9,461 for the
same period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased costs related to the implementation of our ERP system, including $282
of amortization of the deferred loss on our sale-leaseback and $315 of increased IT support costs. These increases were partially
offset by decreases in legal and professional expenses of $202 due to less reliance on outside service firms as a result of increased
internal staffing, and decreased costs of $192 as a result of our disposal of Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC during the fourth
quarter of 2015. 

Other income (loss), net   Other
income (loss), net increased by $234 to income of $116 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss of $118
for the same period in 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we recognized a loss of $410 related to the pending sale of an
office building we owned. 

Interest expense   The following
table presents changes in our interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Income tax benefit   Income tax
benefit increased by $466 to $1,778 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,312 for the same period in 2015.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax losses. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit of $473
related to certain tax credits and a change in our blended state tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 36.22% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to 36.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Loss from continuing operations  
Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,826, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared
to a loss from continuing operations of $2,264 or $0.22 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss
from our natural gas operations decreased by $346. Net loss from continuing operations at our corporate and other segment decreased
by $144 primarily due to a favorable tax benefit partially offset by higher legal and professional costs in 2016, which are non-recurring
expenses. Net loss from our marketing and production operations increased by $52. 

Discontinued operations, net of tax  
Discontinued operations represent the results of operations related to the sale of the Independence assets, our EWW subsidiary,
and the Shoshone and Glacier pipeline assets (together, the  Pipeline Assets ). See  Note 2   Discontinued
Operations  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10-Q for more information regarding the sale
of EWW and the Pipeline Assets. Our income from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $2,
or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $3,395, or $0.32 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

3  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016,
Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue   Revenue decreased by $14,168
to $68,695 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $82,863 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily
attributable to: (1) a decrease in natural gas revenue as a result of decreased sales volumes due to warmer weather in our markets
during the winter months, compared to 2015; (2) the price of natural gas during the first nine months of 2016 was approximately
16% lower than the average price experienced during the first nine months of 2015; and (3) a decrease of $1,352 as a result of
the sale of our Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC utilities during the fourth quarter of 2015. These decreases were partially offset
by an increase of $3,022 in the revenue from our marketing and production operations primarily as a result of our sales of gas
to EWW. We sold EWW during the third quarter of 2015, prior to which any intercompany revenue was eliminated and was included
in discontinued operations in the prior year. 

Gross margin   Gross margin decreased
by $2,200 to $29,754 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $31,954 for the same period in 2015. Our natural
gas operation s margins decreased $2,390, due to decreased sales volumes as a result of warmer weather in our markets, a
decrease in margin of $420 related to the sale of our Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC utilities during the fourth quarter of 2015,
which was partially offset by an unfavorable gas cost adjustment of $693 that occurred during the second quarter of 2015. Gross
margin from our marketing and production operations increased by $190, which was primarily the result of an increase in gross
margin of $299 in our marketing operations as a result of customer growth, partially offset by reduced gross margin of $109 from
our production operations as a result of lower prices. 

Operating expenses   Operating expenses,
other than cost of sales, increased by $886 to $29,160 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $28,274 for the
same period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased costs related to the implementation of our ERP system, including $732
of amortization of the deferred loss on our sale-leaseback and $570 of increased IT support costs. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we also experienced an increase in our legal and professional costs of $348, including the settlement of our
litigation with Richard Osborne and costs related to our proxy contest with Richard Osborne. Depreciation and amortization increased
by $633 during the period, as a result of capital additions related to our ERP system implementation, and other capital additions.
This was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses in our marketing and production segment by $716, as result of a
favorable adjustment of $672 related to an agreement that nullified the earn-out provision of the agreement under which we acquired
the assets of GNR. We also experienced decreased costs of $935 as a result of our disposal of Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC
during the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Other loss, net   Other loss, net
decreased by $182 to a loss of $148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $330 for the same period in 2015.
During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a loss of $531 on the disposal of an unused parcel of land in our natural gas operations
segment. During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our PGC utility, and recorded expected losses
on the sale of $393, which loss did not recur in 2016. 

Interest expense   The following
table presents changes in our interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Income tax benefit   Income tax
benefit increased by $1,415 to $1,072 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an expense of $343 for the same
period in 2015. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was 31.51%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 37.55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

4  

Loss from continuing operations  
Loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $795, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to
income from continuing operations of $440 or $0.04 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income
from our natural gas operations decreased by $1,897 primarily as a result of decreases in our revenue and gross margin from gas
operations, as discussed above. Net loss from continuing operations of our corporate and other segment decreased by $121, and
net income from continuing operations of our gas marketing and production operations increased by $541. 

Discontinued operations, net of tax  
Discontinued operations represent the results of operations related to the sale of the Independence assets, our EWW subsidiary,
and the Pipeline Assets. See  Note 2   Discontinued Operations  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
in this 10-Q for more information regarding the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets. Our loss from discontinued operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $7 or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to income of $4,045 or $0.39 per diluted
share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared with Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Gross Margin   

Revenue decreased by $812 to $10,543 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11,355 for the same period in 2015. The decline in our revenue during
the third quarter was primarily related to lower natural gas prices experienced during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to
the third quarter of 2015. 

Gross margin decreased by $217 to $6,524
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6,741 for the same period in 2015.

                                         decreased by $734 as a result of lower sales volumes. Volumes from transportation customers
                                         declined by 459 MMcf, primarily as a result of the loss of three industrial customers
                                         in the paper industry, which caused a decline in revenue of $192, as compared to the
                                         quarter ended September 30, 2015. The terms of our agreement with one of our transportation
                                         customers, Bucksport, were modified to consider the decrease in volumes of a power generation
                                         facility after a paper mill closure. Gross margins in our Maine market declined by $445,
                                         to $1,214 for the third quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of the decrease in volumes
                                         to transportation customers. These declines were partially offset by an increase in margin
                                         related to customer growth.   

2)  Revenue from our North Carolina
                                         market decreased $231 despite a volume increase of gas consumed of 30 MMcf during the
                                         third quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, as a result of lower prices
                                         as compared to the prior year. Gross margins in our North Carolina market increased by
                                         $107, to $1,798 for the third quarter of 2016 as a result of customer growth.   

4)  Revenue from our Ohio market increased
                                         by $81, which includes an increase of $106 in revenue from transportation customers.
                                         This increase was partially offset by a decline in revenue of $44 from the sales of Clarion
                                         Gas and Walker Gas during the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross margins in our Ohio market
                                         increased by $157, to $1,719 for the third quarter of 2016. Margins for the quarter were
                                         flat when a loss of $157 attributable to Clarion Gas and Walker Gas in the third quarter
                                         of 2015 is considered.   

5)  Total segment revenue and gross
                                         margins decreased by $84 and $72, respectively, during the third quarter of 2016, compared
                                         to the same period in 2015, as a result of the sale of PGC during the fourth quarter
                                         of 2015.   

Gas purchases decreased by $595 to $4,019
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4,614 for the same period in 2015. The decline compared to the third
quarter of 2015 was due to lower gas prices during the 2016 period. Our gas costs are passed on dollar for dollar to our customers
under tariffs regulated by the various commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gas costs are subject to periodic
audits and prudency reviews in all of these jurisdictions. 

Earnings   

The natural gas operations segment s
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,556 or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1,902
or $0.18 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating expenses decreased by $250 to
$8,619 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,869 for the same period in 2015. Distribution, general and
administrative expenses decreased by $460, which consisted primarily of decreases in legal and professional expenses of $404 due
to less reliance on outside service firms as a result of increased internal staffing and decreased costs of $192 as a result of
our disposal of Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC during the fourth quarter of 2015. Those decreases in distribution, general and
administrative expenses were partially offset by increased IT support costs of $298 and increased amortization of the deferred
loss on our sale-leaseback of our ERP system software of $278. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $246 primarily
due to the implementation of our ERP system in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the increase of other depreciable assets from capital
expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Other income increased by $359 to income
of $102 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a loss of $257 for the same period of 2015. During the third
quarter of 2015, we recognized a loss of $410 on the pending sale of a building. 

Income tax benefit decreased by $33 to
$1,072 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $1,105 for the same period in 2015 primarily due
to the decrease in pre-tax loss in 2016, as compared to the 2015 period.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared with Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Gross Margin   

Revenue decreased by $17,190 to $60,213
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $77,403 for the same period in 2015. The decline in our revenue during
the first nine months of 2016 was primarily related to the unusually warm weather experienced across the United States during
the winter and lower natural gas prices experienced during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months
of 2015. 

Gross margin decreased by $2,390 to $29,003
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $31,393 for the same period in 2015. 

The following describes our revenue and
gross margins by market: 

1)  Revenue from our Maine market
                                         decreased by $10,239 as a result of lower sales volumes. Volumes from full service customers
                                         declined by 256 MMcf which caused a decline in revenue of $10,313 for the nine months
                                         ended September 30, 2016. This resulted from warmer weather during the first nine months
                                         of 2016 as compared to 2015, which was partially offset by an increased number of customers.
                                         Volumes from transportation customers declined by 1,356 MMcf, primarily as a result of
                                         the loss of three industrial customers in the paper industry, as compared to the nine
                                         months ended September 30, 2015. The terms of our agreement with one of our transportation
                                         customers, Bucksport, were modified to consider the decrease in volumes related to a
                                         power generation facility after a paper mill closure. Gross margins in our Maine market
                                         declined by $1,815 to $6,247 for the first nine months of 2016, primarily as a result
                                         of the decrease in volumes to transportation customers partially offset by volume from
                                         new customers.   

2)  Revenue from our Ohio market decreased
                                         $3,550, including a decrease of $3,325 from transportation customers during the first
                                         nine months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Transportation volumes also
                                         declined by 336 MMcf during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same period
                                         in 2015. Revenue from full service customers declined by $231 as a result of lower gas
                                         prices and warmer weather during the winter months. Additionally, our Ohio market experienced
                                         a decline in revenue of $455 from the sales of Clarion Gas and Walker Gas during the
                                         fourth quarter of 2015. Gross margins in our Ohio market declined by $588 to $8,994 for
                                         the first nine months of 2016. Ohio margin declines were partially offset by the absence
                                         of an unfavorable gas cost adjustment of $693 related to a PUCO stipulation that occurred
                                         during the second quarter of 2015.   

4)  Revenue from our North Carolina
                                         market increased by $195 due to colder weather and increased customer count, which led
                                         to a net volume increase of gas consumed of 23 MMcf during the first nine months of 2016,
                                         compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2015,
                                         we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $234 in our unbilled revenue calculation. Gross
                                         margins in our North Carolina market increased by $411 to $6,676 for the first nine months
                                         of 2016.   

Gas purchases decreased by $14,800 to
$31,210 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $46,010 for the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily
the result of lower prices paid for natural gas and lower volumes of gas sold across our markets during the first nine months
of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an unfavorable
gas cost adjustment of $693 related to a PUCO stipulation. Our gas costs are passed on dollar for dollar to our customers under
tariffs regulated by the various commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gas costs are subject to periodic audits
and prudency reviews in all of these jurisdictions. 

8  

Earnings   

The natural gas operations segment s
net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $445 or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2,342
or $0.22 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating expenses increased by $918 to
$26,316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $25,398 for the same period in 2015. Distribution, general and
administrative expenses increased by $371, which consisted primarily of increased personnel costs of $400, amortization of the
deferred loss on our sale-leaseback of our ERP system software of $725, and increased IT support costs of $558. These increases
in distribution, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreased professional services expenses of $493
due to less reliance on outside service firms as a result of increased internal staffing and a decrease of $935 as a result of
our disposal of Clarion Gas, Walker Gas and PGC. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $684 primarily due to the
implementation of our ERP system in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the increase of other depreciable assets from capital expenditures
during the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Other expense decreased by $205 to $106
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $311 for the same period in 2015. During the first nine months 2016,
we recorded a loss of $531 on the sale of an unused parcel of land. During the first nine months of 2015, we entered into an agreement
to sell our PGC utility and a building, and recorded expected losses on those sales of $803. 

Income tax expense decreased by $1,248
to $182 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,430 for the same period in 2015 primarily due to the decrease
in pre-tax income in 2016, as compared to the 2015 period. 

MARKETING AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared with Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Gross Margin   

Revenue from our marketing and production
segment increased by $1,083 to $2,812 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,729 for the same period in
2015. Revenue from our EWR marketing operations increased as a result of our sales of gas to EWW. We sold EWW during the third
quarter of 2015, prior to which any intercompany revenue was eliminated and was included in discontinued operations in the prior
year. Revenue from our GNR subsidiary decreased by $95 compared to last year, as a result of lower gas prices and sales volumes. 

9  

Gross margin decreased by $22 to $52 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $74 for the same period in 2015. Gross margin from our production operation
decreased by $52 as a result of lower prices received for the volumes that we produced. Gross margin from our marketing operations
increased by $30 as a result of incremental margin from new customer additions. 

Earnings   

The marketing and production segment s
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $117, compared to a net loss of $65 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Operating expenses increased by $16 to
$158 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to expense of $142 for the same period in 2015. 

Income tax expense was flat at $38 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016,
Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Gross Margin   

Revenue from our marketing and production
segment increased by $3,022 to $8,482 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5,460 for the same period in
2015. Revenue from our EWR marketing operations increased as a result of our sales of gas to EWW. We sold EWW during the third
quarter of 2015, prior to which any intercompany revenue was eliminated and was included in discontinued operations in the prior
year. Revenue from our GNR subsidiary decreased by $730, as compared to last year, as a result of lower gas prices and sales volumes. 

Gross margin increased by $190 to $751
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $561 for the same period in 2015. Gross margin from our marketing operations
increased by $299 as a result of incremental margin from new customer additions. Gross margin from our production operation decreased
by $109 as a result of lower prices received for the volumes that we produced. 

Earnings   

The marketing and production segment s
net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $457, compared to a net loss of $84, for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Operating expenses decreased by $716 to
a benefit of $119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $597 of expenses for the same period in 2015. Operating
expenses decreased as a result of decreased distribution, general and administrative costs, which included a favorable adjustment
of $672 as a result of an agreement that nullified the earn-out provision of the purchase agreement whereby we acquired the assets
of GNR. 

Income tax expense increased by $346 to
$297 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $49 for the comparable period in 2015 as a result
of the increase in pre-tax income in 2016, as compared to a pre-tax loss in the comparable period of 2015. 

10  

CORPORATE AND OTHER OPERATIONS  

Our corporate and other reporting segment
includes the results of corporate acquisitions and other equity transactions, as well as certain other income and expense items
associated with our holding company functions. It also includes the results of our insurance business. Therefore, it does not
have standard revenue, gas purchase costs, or gross margin. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016,
Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net loss from continuing operations improved
by $144 to a loss of $153 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year period. Operating expenses increased
by $271 to $721 primarily as a result of an increase in our legal and professional costs of $219 related to corporate matters,
including costs related to our proxy contest with Richard Osborne, which are non-recurring expenses. As a result of the decline
in net income from $3,098 at September 30, 2015 to a loss of $151 for the comparable current year period, the income tax benefit
increased by $499 to $668 at September 30, 2016. 

Income from discontinued operations   

Discontinued operations represent the
results of operations related to the sale of the Independence assets, our EWW subsidiary, and the Pipeline Assets. See  Note
2   Discontinued Operations  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10-Q for more information
regarding the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets. Net income from discontinued operations decreased by $3,393 to $2 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,395 for the same period in 2015, because the disposal of our discontinued operations
was completed during 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016,
Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net loss from continuing operations decreased
by $121 to a loss of $1,697 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year period. Operating expenses
increased by $684 to $2,963 primarily as a result of an increase in our legal and professional costs of $874 related to corporate
matters, including the settlement of our litigation with Richard Osborne and costs related to our proxy contest with Richard Osborne,
which are non-recurring expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $81 that occurred because we did not
allocate overhead to held for sale operations in 2015, so overhead that would have been allocated to the disposed entities was
instead recorded by the corporate and other segment. As a result of the decline in net income from $2,227 at September 30, 2015,
to a loss of $1,704, at September 30, 2016, the income tax benefit increased by $513 to $1,551 at September 30, 2016. 

11  

Loss from discontinued operations   

Discontinued operations represent the
results of operations related to the sale of the Independence assets, our EWW subsidiary, and the Pipeline Assets. See  Note
2   Discontinued Operations  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10-Q for more information
regarding the sale of EWW and the Pipeline Assets. Net income from discontinued operations decreased by $4,052 to a loss of $7
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to income of $4,045 for the same period in 2015, because the disposal
of our discontinued operations was completed during 2015. 

Liquidity  

Operating activities provide our primary
source of cash. Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation,
depletion, amortization, deferred income taxes, and changes in working capital. 

Cash provided by discontinued operations
is presented separately from cash flows from continuing operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The
disposition of EWW and the Pipeline Assets is not expected to have a material negative impact on our liquidity. 

Our ability to maintain liquidity depends
upon our line of credit with Bank of America. We periodically repay our short-term borrowings under the revolving line of credit
by using cash from operations and the net proceeds from the sale of long-term debt and equity securities. 

Cash, excluding restricted cash, increased
to $3,833 at September 30, 2016, compared to $2,728 at December 31, 2015. 

Operating
Cash Flow   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1,737 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily
as a result of lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital requirements as a result of warmer weather and lower
prices for natural gas. As a result, we experienced a $4,872 decline in cash outflows from accounts payable during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, we experienced a $2,258 decline
in cash inflows from accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Investing
Cash Flow   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, cash used in investing activities decreased by $2,832, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was
primarily attributable to a decrease of $2,540 in cash paid for capital expenditures. 

12  

Capital Expenditures  

Our capital expenditures totaled $5,785
and $8,325 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our capital spending is focused
on the growth of our natural gas operations segment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures
included $1,907 and $929 related to our new ERP system that were not financed under a lease agreement. We conduct ongoing construction
activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion, maintenance, and enhancement of our gas pipeline
systems. We are actively expanding our systems in North Carolina and Maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service
in those areas. 

Financing Cash Flow   

Cash used in financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $4,671 and $17,963, respectively. Major items affecting financing cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of the prior year include: a net decrease of $15,511
in repayments of our line of credit, a net increase in repayments of notes payable of $2,479, and an increase of $935 in payments
of capital lease obligations. 

Historically, to the extent that cash
flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our expenditure requirements, including costs of gas purchased and
capital expenditures, we have used our revolving line of credit. In general, our short-term borrowing needs for purchases of gas
inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short-term borrowing needs for financing
customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months. Generally, our cash flow increases and our borrowings decrease,
beginning in January, as monthly heating bills are paid and the gas we paid for and placed in storage in the summer months is
used to supply our customers. Our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our revolving line of credit with Bank of America,
which had a balance of $18,250 and $15,750 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Additionally, at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had short-term notes payable with a principal balance of $4,000 and $2,000, respectively, with
NIL Funding. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short term borrowings during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, was 3.04% and 3.00%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on our short-term borrowings outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was 3.32% and 2.71%, respectively. 

During the second quarter of 2016, nearly
all of our long-term notes payable became payable within one year. These notes payable are presented as long-term balances because
on October 19, 2016, we refinanced these long-term debt agreements. See  Corporate Structural Revisions and Financing Agreements ,
below, for further details.  Upon closing, proceeds from the new debt arrangements replaced our five existing loan facilities
and provided cash for operating purposes. In our September 30, 2016, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, we have reclassified
the short term portion of our borrowings because they were refinanced before these financial statements were issued. Long-term
debt was $39,439, net of debt issuance costs of $282 at December 31, 2015, including the amounts due within one year. Current
maturities of our long-term debt were $5,012 at December 31, 2015. 

Corporate Structural Revisions and
Financing Agreements  

On October 19, 2016, we entered into a
Credit Agreement and Revolving Note with Bank of America. The Credit Agreement provides for a $42,000 unsecured revolving credit
facility which incurs variable interest on a grid structure, based on our leverage ratio. The credit facility has a maturity date
of October 19, 2021. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with a number of covenants, including limitations
on incurring additional debt, dispositions and investments, and maintaining a total debt to capital ratio of not more than 0.50
to 1.00, and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement and Revolving Note,
the occurrence and continuation of one or more of the Events of Default specified in the Credit Agreement would require us to
immediately pay all amounts then remaining unpaid on the Note. 

Also on October 19, 2016, we entered into
a Note Purchase Agreement providing for the issuance and sale to investors in a private placement of $50,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 4.23% Senior Notes. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we issued an unsecured Senior Note, in the amount of
$50,000 held by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America ( TIAA ). The Senior Note is a twelve-year term
note due October 19, 2028 and bears a 4.23% fixed interest rate payable semiannually. The Note Purchase Agreement and Senior Note
are subject to other customary covenants and default provisions. An occurrence of an Event of Default specified in the Note Purchase
Agreement would require us to immediately pay all amounts then remaining unpaid on the Senior Note. 

The Revolving Note and Senior Note are
each guaranteed by our wholly owned non-utility subsidiaries, Energy West Propane, Inc., EWR, GNR, Independence, Lone Wolfe, and
PHC. 

13  

Additionally, on October 13, 2016, we
created PHC, an Ohio corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary under which each of our eight regulated entities is held. This
streamlines our corporate structure to facilitate greater focus on the four regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate, as well
as to simplify our financing arrangements.  With the new structure, which received regulatory approval, the regulated entities
are segregated from non-regulated operations.  

Bank of America   

As of September 30, 2016, our Energy West
subsidiary had a credit facility with Bank of America ( Credit Facility ) that provided for a revolving line of credit
with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30,000, due April 1, 2017. This revolving line of credit included an annual commitment fee
ranging from 25 to 45 basis points of the unused portion of the facility and accrued interest based on our option of two indices:
(1) a base rate, which is defined as a daily rate based on the highest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds Rate plus
50 basis points, or (z) the daily LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, or (2) LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points. At September 30,
2016, we had $1,200 of base rate borrowings and at December 31, 2015, we did not have any base rate borrowings. 

Total borrowings under the revolving line
of credit were $18,250 and $15,750, and bore interest at a weighted average outstanding rate of 2.40% and 2.17%, at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. After considering outstanding letters of credit of $164, a total of $11,586 was
available to us for loans and letters of credit under the revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2016. 

In addition, Energy West had a $10,000
term loan with Bank of America with a maturity date of April 1, 2017 (the  Term Loan ). The Term Loan portion
of the Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175 to 225 basis points and contained an interest rate swap provision
that allowed for the interest rate to be fixed in the future. The Term Loan amortized at a rate of $125 per quarter. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Term Loan bore interest at 2.27% and 2.17%, and had a balance of $8,000 and $8,375, respectively. 

The Bank of America revolving line of
credit and Term Loan contained various covenants, which included limitations on total dividends and distributions, limitations
on investments in other entities, maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain
indebtedness as outlined below. 

The credit facility restricted
Energy West s ability to pay dividends and make distributions, redemptions and repurchases of stock during the preceding
60-month period to 80% of its net income over that period. In addition, no event of default may have existed at the time such
dividend, distribution, redemption or repurchase was made. 

The credit facility limited investments
in another entity by acquisition of any debt or equity securities or assets or by making loans or advances to such entity. Energy
West was also prohibited from consummating a merger or consolidation or selling all or substantially all of its assets or stock
except for (i) any merger, consolidation or sale by or with certain of its subsidiaries, (ii) any such purchase or other acquisition
by Energy West or certain of its subsidiaries and (iii) sales and dispositions of assets for at least fair market value so long
as the net book value of all assets sold or otherwise disposed of in any fiscal year did not exceed 5% of the net book value of
Energy West s assets as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year. 

Energy West must have maintained
a total debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 0.55-to-1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.0-to-1.0. The credit
facility restricted Energy West s ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness except (i) indebtedness under the credit
facility (ii) indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases including the capital lease related to the Loring pipeline,
and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500, (iii) certain indebtedness of Energy West s subsidiaries, (iv) certain
subordinated indebtedness, (v) certain hedging obligations and (vi) other indebtedness not to exceed $1,000. 

NIL Funding  

On October 23, 2015, we entered into a
loan agreement and promissory note for $3,000 with NIL Funding. Pursuant to the note and loan agreement, NIL Funding made a loan
to us that bore an annual interest rate of 6.95%, and had a maturity date of April 20, 2016. On March 14, 2016, the NIL Funding
credit facility was paid off and extinguished. As of December 31, 2015, the NIL Funding loan had an outstanding balance of $2,000. 

14  

On April 15, 2016, we entered into a loan
agreement and promissory note for $4,000 with NIL Funding. Under the note and loan agreement, we made monthly interest payments
to NIL Funding, based on an annual rate of 7.5% and the principal balance of the note would have been due upon maturity on November
15, 2016. The note and loan agreement were subject to other customary loan covenants and default provisions. In an event of default,
as defined under the loan agreement, NIL Funding could have, at its option, required us to immediately pay the outstanding principal
balance of the note as well as any and all interest and other payments due or convert any part of the amounts due and unpaid to
shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 95% of the previous day s closing price on the NYSE MKT. NIL Funding
is a related party of ours. See  Note 12   Related Party Transactions  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 

Allstate/CUNA   

On June 29, 2007, Energy West authorized
the sale of $13,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.16% Notes, due June 29, 2017. In connection with our sale of EWW and the
Pipeline Assets, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we committed to repay $4,500 of Notes that were allocated to EWW and EWD on
February 12, 2016, plus a prepayment penalty of $310 that was recognized in discontinued operations, net of tax during the fourth
quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2016 we adjusted our estimate of the prepayment penalty by $29, which was recognized
within discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. See  Note 2  
Discontinued Operations  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more
information regarding our discontinued operations. 

The Notes contained various covenants,
which included limitations on Energy West s total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness as outlined
below, maintenance of certain interest coverage ratios, and limitations on asset sales as outlined below. 

The Notes limited Energy West s
total dividends and distributions made in the immediately preceding 60-month period to 100% of aggregate consolidated net income
for such period. 

The Notes restricted Energy West
from incurring additional senior indebtedness in excess of 65% of capitalization at any time. 

The Notes also required Energy
West to maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than 150% of the pro forma annual interest charges on a consolidated basis
in two of the three preceding fiscal years. 

Energy West was prohibited from
selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property or assets except (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) property or
assets that were no longer usable in its business or (iii) property or assets transferred between Energy West and its subsidiaries
if the aggregate net book value of all properties and assets so disposed of during the twelve month period next preceding the
date of such sale or disposition would constitute more than 15% of the aggregate book value of all Energy West s tangible
assets. In addition, Energy West could only consummate a merger or consolidation, dissolve or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its assets (i) if there was no event of default, (ii) the provisions of the notes were assumed by the surviving or continuing
corporation and such entity further agreed that it would continue to operate its facilities as part of a system comprising a public
utility regulated by the MPSC or another federal or state agency or authority and (iii) the surviving or continuing corporation
had a net worth immediately subsequent to such acquisition, consolidation or merger equal to or greater than $10,000. 

Sun Life   

On May 2, 2011, we and our Ohio subsidiaries, NEO, Orwell and
Brainard, issued a $15,334, 5.38% Senior Secured Guaranteed Fixed Rate Note due June 1, 2017 ( Fixed Rate Note ).
Payments for these notes prior to maturity were interest-only. 

Each of the notes were governed by a note
purchase agreement. Concurrent with the funding and closing of the notes, which occurred on May 3, 2011, the parties executed
amended note purchase agreements. 

The Fixed Rate Note was a joint obligation
of our holding company and our Ohio subsidiaries, and was guaranteed by Gas Natural, Lightning Pipeline and Great Plains (together
with the Ohio subsidiaries, the  Obligors ). Prepayment of this note prior to maturity was subject to a 50 basis point
make-whole premium. This note received approval from the PUCO on March 30, 2011. The note was governed by a note purchase agreement.
Under the note purchase agreement, we were required to make monthly interest payments and the principal was due at maturity. 

15  

On October 24, 2012, Orwell, NEO,
and Brainard issued a Senior Secured Guaranteed Note ( Senior Note ) in the amount of $2,990. The Senior Note was
placed pursuant to a third amendment to the original note purchase agreement dated as of November 1, 2010, by and among Orwell,
NEO, and Brainard, and Great Plains, Lightning Pipeline, Gas Natural and Sun Life. The Senior Note had an interest rate of 4.15%,
compounded semi-annually, and matured on June 1, 2017. The Senior Note was a joint obligation of the Ohio subsidiaries and
was guaranteed by our non-regulated Ohio subsidiaries. 

The Sun Life covenants restricted certain
cash balances and required a debt service reserve account to be maintained to cover approximately one year of interest payments.
The total balance in the debt service reserve accounts was $948 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and is included in
restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt service reserve account cannot be used for operating cash
needs. 

The Fixed Rate Note and Senior Note contained
various covenants, which included, among others, limitations on total dividends and distributions, restrictions on certain indebtedness,
limitations on asset sales, and maintenance of certain debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios as outlined below. 

The amendments provided that
any cash dividends, distributions, redemptions or repurchases of common stock may be made by the obligors to the holding company
only if (i) the aggregate amount of all such dividends, distributions, redemptions and repurchases for the fiscal year did not
exceed 70% of net income of the obligors for the four fiscal quarters then ending determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter
for the four fiscal quarters then ending, and (ii) there existed no other event of default at the time the dividend, distribution,
redemption or repurchase was made. 

The Ohio subsidiaries were prohibited
from creating, assuming or incurring additional indebtedness except for (i) obligations under certain financing agreements, (ii)
indebtedness incurred under certain capitalized leases and purchase money obligations not to exceed $500 at any one time outstanding,
(iii) indebtedness outstanding as of March 31, 2011, (iv) certain unsecured intercompany indebtedness and (v) certain other indebtedness
permitted under the notes. 

The notes prohibited us from
selling or otherwise transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business and to the extent such sales or transfers,
in the aggregate, over each rolling twelve month period, did not exceed 1% of our total assets. Generally, we could consummate
a merger or consolidation if there was no event of default and the provisions of the notes were assumed by the surviving or continuing
corporation. We were also generally limited in making acquisitions in excess of 10% of our total assets. An event of default,
if not cured, would have required us to immediately pay the outstanding principal balance of the notes as well as any and all
interest and other payments due. An event of default would have also entitled Sun Life to exercise certain rights with respect
to the collateral that secured the indebtedness incurred under the notes. 

The Fixed Rate Note required
an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The interest coverage
ratio was measured with respect to the Obligors on a consolidated basis and also with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis. The note generally defined the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest expense.
The note defined EBITDA as net income plus the sum of interest expense, any provision for federal, state, and local taxes, depreciation,
and amortization determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but excluding any extraordinary non-operating
income or loss and any gain or loss from non-operating transactions. The notes also required that we did not permit indebtedness
to exceed 60% of capitalization at any time. Like the interest coverage ratio, the ratio of debt to capitalization was measured
on a consolidated basis for the Obligors, and again on a consolidated basis with respect to us and all of our subsidiaries. 

Ring Fencing Restrictions  

In addition to the financial covenants
under our credit facilities, the ring fencing provisions required by our regulatory commissions imposed additional limitations
on our liquidity. Specifically, usage of the Bank of America line of credit was regulated by ring fencing provisions from the
MPSC, MPUC and NCUC. One of the ring fencing provisions issued by the MPSC required that of the $30,000 line of credit available,
$11,200 must have been used or been available to be used exclusively by EWM. The remaining $18,800 balance of the line of credit
was available for use by Energy West and its other Montana, North Carolina and Maine subsidiaries. Energy West and EWM were required
to provide monthly financial reports to the MPSC. As of September 30, 2016, we had available $6,634 to be drawn on the Bank of
America line of credit after giving effect to the $11,200 allocation to EWM. 

16  

On November 24, 2014, the MPSC issued
an order directing, in part, that Energy West require Gas Natural to repay an intercompany payable to Energy West by December
24, 2014. In addition, the MPSC order restricted Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries
from paying dividends to Gas Natural until persuasive evidence could be presented that Energy West was on a sound financial footing
and that effect had been given to the MPSC s ring-fencing conditions; the strongest indication being the absence of ongoing
balances owed to Energy West by Gas Natural. On April 9, 2015, Energy West filed a request to reinstate Energy West and its Montana,
Maine, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to Gas Natural. On July 22, 2015, the MPSC issued an
order allowing for the reinstatement of the dividends. They also approved a special dividend to be declared from the proceeds
from the sale of Energy West s subsidiaries EWW and Pipeline assets. 

Ring fencing provisions also subjected
us to certain restrictions on our capital structure. The MPSC required Energy West to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more
than 52%. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all ring fencing provisions. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

We do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements,
other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Item
3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk   

There have been no material changes in
market risk at September 30, 2016, from that reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item
4. Controls And Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

As of September 30, 2016, we evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

There were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

  (amounts in thousands)  

From time to time, we are involved in
lawsuits and other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We are contesting each of these lawsuits
vigorously and believe we have defenses to the allegations that have been made. In our opinion, the outcome to these legal actions
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 

Beginning on December 10, 2013, five putative
shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed by five different individuals, in their capacity as our shareholders, in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, purportedly on behalf of us and naming certain of our current and former
executive officers and directors as individual defendants. These five shareholder lawsuits are captioned as follows: (1) Richard
J. Wickham v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:13-cv-02718-LW); (2) John Durgerian v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case
No. 1:13-cv-02805-LW); (3) Joseph Ferrigno v. Richard M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:13-cv-02822-LW); (4) Kyle Warner v. Richard
M. Osborne, et al., (Case No. 1:14-cv-00007-LW) and (5) Gary F. Peters v. Richard M. Osborne, (Case No. 1:14-cv-0026-CAB). On
February 6, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated solely for purposes of conducting limited pretrial discovery, and on February
21, 2014, the Court appointed lead counsel for all five lawsuits. The parties are currently conducting discovery in this lawsuit. 

The consolidated action contains claims
against various of our current or former directors or officers alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities
laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment arising primarily out of our acquisition of
the Ohio utilities, services provided by JDOG Marketing and the acquisition of JDOG Marketing, and the sale of our common stock
by Richard Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer, and Thomas J. Smith, our former chief financial officer.
The suit, in which we are named as a nominal defendant, seeks the recovery of unspecified damages allegedly sustained by us, corporate
reforms, disgorgement, restitution, the recovery of plaintiffs  attorney s fees and other relief. 

We, along with the other defendants, filed
a motion to dismiss the consolidated action in its entirety on May 8, 2014. The motion to dismiss was based on, among other things,
the failure of the plaintiffs to make a demand on our board of directors to address the alleged wrongdoing prior to filing their
lawsuits and the failure to state viable claims against various individual defendants. Richard Osborne, individually, is now represented
by counsel independent of all other defendants in the case and submitted a filing in support of the motion to dismiss on his own
behalf. 

On September 24, 2014, the magistrate
judge assigned to the case issued a report and recommendation in response to the motion to dismiss. The magistrate judge recommended
that the plaintiffs  claims against the individual defendants with respect to the  unjust enrichment  allegation
in the complaint be dismissed. The magistrate judge recommended that all other portions of the motion to dismiss be denied. On
June 4, 2015, the trial judge assigned to the case adopted in full the report and recommendation, the objections filed by the
defendants, and the responses from the plaintiffs. The parties are currently engaged in ongoing settlement discussions. 

At this time we are unable to provide
an estimate of any possible future losses that we may incur in connection to this suit. We carry insurance that we believe will
cover any negative outcome associated with this action. This insurance carries a $250 deductible, which we have reached. Although
we believe these insurance proceeds are available, we may incur costs and expenses related to this suit that are not covered by
insurance which may be substantial. Any unfavorable outcome could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

On July 14, 2016, we entered into a settlement
agreement with Richard Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer (the  Settlement ). Under the Settlement,
we settled numerous, but not all, outstanding litigation and regulatory proceedings between us, including our subsidiaries and
certain of our current and former directors, and Mr. Osborne. All matters previously disclosed and subject to the Settlement are
briefly referred to below and described in further detail in Part II, Item I of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended March 31, 2016, and under the caption  Litigation with Richard Osborne  in the Company s Definitive Proxy
Statement, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2016 and June 21, 2016, respectively. The specific litigation and regulatory proceedings
subject to the Settlement:

Richard
                                         M. Osborne and Richard M. Osborne Trust, Under Restated and Amended Trust Agreement of
                                         January 13, 1995 v. Gas Natural Inc., et al. , Case No. 15CV844836, filed in the Court
                                         of Common Pleas in Cuyahoga County, Ohio on April 28, 2015:  On June 13, 2014, Richard
                                         Osborne filed a lawsuit against us and our corporate secretary captioned,  Richard
                                         M. Osborne and Richard M. Osborne Trust, Under Restated and Amended Trust Agreement of
                                         February 24, 2012 v. Gas Natural, Inc. et al.,  Case No. 14CV001210 in the Lake
                                         County Court of Common Pleas. Mr. Osborne sought an order requiring us to provide him
                                         with meeting minutes and corporate resolutions for the past five years. On February 13,
                                         2015, Mr. Osborne voluntarily dismissed his complaint. On April 28, 2015, Mr. Osborne
                                         refiled this lawsuit in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. We filed a counterclaim
                                         against Mr. Osborne seeking to have him declared a vexatious litigator. Pursuant to the
                                         Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         Case No. 14CV001512, filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Lake County, Ohio on July
                                         28, 2014:  Mr. Osborne (1) demanded payment of an earn-out amount associated with
                                         our purchase of assets from JDOG Marketing, (2) alleged that our board of directors breached
                                         its fiduciary duties by removing Mr. Osborne as chairman and chief executive officer,
                                         (3) sought to enforce a July 15, 2014, term sheet, where the parties memorialized certain
                                         discussions they had in connection with their efforts to resolve the dispute arising
                                         out of the lawsuit, which included a severance payment of $1,000, and (4) sought to invalidate
                                         the results of the July 30, 2014, shareholder meeting and asked the court to order us
                                         to hold a new meeting at a later date. Mr. Osborne also sought compensatory and punitive
                                         damages. We asserted counterclaims including claims for defamation, arising out of the
                                         July 9, 2014, letter Mr. Osborne sent to our shareholders and conversion for a company-provided
                                         car Mr. Osborne refuses to return to us. Additional counterclaims included claims for
                                         battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, asserted by Wade Brooksby and
                                         Michael Victor, respectively, former members of our board of directors. Pursuant to the
                                         Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on March 12, 2015:
                                          Cobra s complaint alleged that it uses a service to track the locations of
                                         its vehicles via GPS monitoring. Cobra alleged that we, and other defendants, accessed
                                         and intercepted vehicle tracking data, after we knew or should have known that our authority
                                         to do so had ended. The complaint alleged claims under the Stored Communications Act,
                                         the Wiretap Act, and various state-law claims. September 17, 2015, the court granted
                                         defendants  motion for summary judgment and dismissed Cobra s complaint in
                                         its entirety. On October 19, 2015, Cobra filed its Notice of Appeal to the Sixth Circuit
                                         Court of Appeals. Pursuant to the Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         Court of Common Pleas in Lake County, Ohio on October 29, 2015:  The complaint alleged
                                         that Richard Osborne, while the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Orwell,
                                         Great Plains, JDOG, and GNSC fraudulently presented demands for payment to GNSC and Orwell,
                                         claiming that payments were due for natural gas purchased from Great Plains and JDOG
                                         from January 2012 through September 2013. Mr. Osborne ultimately obtained two checks
                                         from Orwell in the total amount of $202. Orwell s complaint stated a claim of theft
                                         and sought liquidated damages in the amount of these checks. Pursuant to the Settlement,
                                         this case was dismissed with prejudice.

                                         filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Lake County, Ohio on November 30, 2015:  Orwell
                                         filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction against Ohio Rural Natural Gas
                                         Co-Op (Ohio Rural) and Mr. Osborne alleging that Ohio Rural and Mr. Osborne acted in
                                         concert to convert, for the use of their own supply, natural gas supply lines owned and
                                         operated by Orwell. The complaint alleged that on November 20, 2015, Ohio Rural and Mr.
                                         Osborne tampered with and severed gas lines owned by Orwell on Tin Man Road in Mentor,
                                         Ohio, terminated its service to approximately 50 independently owned businesses, and
                                         converted it for their own personal use. The complaint stated claims for conversion,
                                         unjust enrichment and civil remedy against criminal act, and seeks compensatory and liquidated
                                         damages. On November 30, 2015, Orwell filed a case with the PUCO on the same grounds,
                                         captioned   In the Matter of Orwell Natural Gas Company, Brainard Gas Corporation
                                         and Northeast Ohio Natural Gas Corporations  Request for Injunctive Relief ,
                                         Case No. 15-2015-GA-UNC.  Pursuant to the Settlement, this matter was dismissed with

Orwell
                                         Natural Gas Company v. Orwell-Trumbull Pipeline Company, LLC , Case Number 15-0475-GA-CSS,
                                         filed with the PUCO on March 9, 2015:  Orwell s complaint alleged that on March
                                         5, 2015, an Orwell-Trumbull employee notified Orwell that a pipeline owned by Orwell-Trumbull
                                         along Vrooman Road in Lake County, Ohio would be shut down completely for an alleged
                                         need to conduct maintenance or move Orwell-Trumbull pipelines. The complaint alleged
                                         that Orwell-Trumbull violated Ohio law due to its improper attempt to shut down the pipeline
                                         along Vrooman Road and requested the PUCO order Orwell-Trumbull to refrain from shutting
                                         off service to the residential and commercial customers along Vrooman Road. On May 9,
                                         2016, Orwell-Trumbull, Orwell and the Ohio Consumers  Counsel filed a stipulation
                                         in which Orwell-Trumbull agreed to provide monthly status updates to the parties to the
                                         stipulation regarding the ownership status of certain pipelines along Vrooman Road. The
                                         monthly updates will be required until Orwell-Trumbull has either completed construction
                                         to re-establish connections or filed a petition to abandon service regarding its pipelines
                                         on Vrooman Road. On June 1, 2016, the PUCO dismissed Orwell s complaint on the
                                         basis that the May 9, 2016 stipulation resolved all of the issues in the complaint. Pursuant
                                         to the Settlement, this case was closed.    

Orwell-Trumbull
                                         Pipeline Company, LLC v. Orwell Natural Gas Company , Case No: 01-15-0002-9137, filed
                                         with the American Arbitration Association on or about March 12, 2015:  Filed by Orwell-Trumbull
                                         with respect to a dispute under the Natural Gas Transportation Service Agreement between
                                         it and Orwell and Brainard Gas Corp. Orwell-Trumbull claims Orwell breached the exclusivity
                                         provisions in the Agreement. Orwell filed several counterclaims, including claims for
                                         breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Pursuant to the Settlement, this case
                                         was dismissed with prejudice.   

Orwell
                                         Natural Gas Company v. Orwell-Trumbull Pipeline Company LLC , Case Number 15-0637-GA-CSS,
                                         filed with the PUCO on March 31, 2015:  On March 31, 2015, Orwell filed a complaint
                                         on the same grounds as Case No: 01-15-0002-9137, described above, with the PUCO to address
                                         issues regarding the operation of and contract rights for utilities on the Orwell Trumbull
                                         Pipeline. The PUCO issued an opinion and order on June 15, 2016, asserting jurisdiction
                                         over the Agreement, modifying certain of its terms, ordering any other pipeline owned
                                         or controlled by Richard Osborne to file a rate case within 60 days of the order, and
                                         ordering the PUCO Staff to undertake an investigative audit of all pipeline companies
                                         owned or controlled by Richard Osborne. Although the parties agreed upon certain conduct
                                         in the interim, under the Settlement Orwell-Trumbull has the right to appeal the June
                                         15, 2016 PUCO opinion and order. Orwell-Trumbull filed a request for a rehearing on July
                                         15, 2016. Orwell filed its memorandum in opposition on July 25, 2016. On August 3, 2016,
                                         Orwell-Trumbull s request for a rehearing was granted.   

Gas
                                         Natural Resources LLC v. Orwell-Trumbull Pipeline Company LLC , Case No. 16-0663-GA-CSS,
                                         filed with the PUCO on March 28, 2016:  GNR filed a complaint before the PUCO pursuant
                                         to a transportation service agreement between it and Orwell-Trumbull. The agreement was
                                         assigned to GNR when we acquired the assets of JDOG Marketing on June 1, 2013. The complaint
                                         alleged that Orwell-Trumbull breached the termination provisions of the agreement and
                                         violated Ohio law due to Orwell-Trumbull s failure to file the agreement with the
                                         PUCO and its improper attempt to discontinue service under agreement. Pursuant to the
                                         Settlement, this case was dismissed with prejudice.   

We and Mr. Osborne further agreed to dismiss
all other pending or threatened litigation matters between us, although not specifically identified in the agreement. In connection
with the Settlement, Mr. Osborne withdrew the director candidates he had nominated for election to the board at the annual meeting
of shareholders held on July 27, 2016. The proxy materials circulated in support of his candidates were also withdrawn. Pursuant
to the Settlement, further details of the Settlement are confidential. 

On February 25, 2013, one of our former
officers, Jonathan Harrington, filed a lawsuit captioned  Jonathan Harrington v. Energy West, Inc. and Does 1-4, 
Case No. DDV-13-159 in the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. Mr. Harrington claims he was terminated in
violation of a Montana statute requiring just cause for termination. In addition, he alleges claims for negligent infliction of
emotional distress and negligent slander. Mr. Harrington is seeking relief for economic loss, including lost wages and fringe
benefits for a period of at least four years from the date of discharge, together with interest. Mr. Harrington is an Ohio resident
and was employed in our Ohio corporate offices. On March 20, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that
Mr. Harrington was an Ohio employee, not a Montana employee, and therefore the statute does not apply. On July 1, 2014, the court
conducted a hearing, made extensive findings on the record, and issued an Order finding in our favor and dismissing all of Mr.
Harrington s claims. On July 21, 2014, Mr. Harrington appealed the dismissal to the Montana Supreme Court. On August 11,
2015, the Montana Supreme Court agreed with us that Mr. Harrington s employment was governed by Ohio law, and as such he
could not take advantage of Montana s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act. However, the Montana Supreme Court also held
the trial court erred in determining it lacked jurisdiction over the case, finding the trial court should have retained jurisdiction
and applied Ohio law to Mr. Harrington s claims. As Ohio is an  at will  state, we believe there are no claims
under Ohio law and the case will ultimately be dismissed by the trial court on remand. On September 28, 2015, Mr. Harrington filed
a motion to amend the complaint to assert new causes of action not previously alleged including claims for misrepresentation,
constructive fraud based on alleged representations, slander, and mental pain and suffering. We answered the amended complaint
to preserve our defenses, and we have also opposed Mr. Harrington s motion to amend. On December 14, 2015, we filed a motion
to dismiss the Montana action in its entirety on the basis that the forum is not appropriate. Our motion to dismiss is now fully
briefed and is awaiting ruling by the court. We continue to believe Mr. Harrington s claims under both Montana and Ohio
law are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend this case on all grounds.
