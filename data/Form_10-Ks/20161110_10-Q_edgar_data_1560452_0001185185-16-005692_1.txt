1.           Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Texas Republic Capital Corporation (the  Company ) is the parent holding company of Texas Republic Life Insurance Company ( TRLIC ).  The Company was incorporated in Texas on May 15, 2012, for the primary purpose of forming and capitalizing a life insurance company subsidiary.

The State of Texas Department of Insurance approved TRLIC s charter on August 1, 2016.  The Company capitalized TRLIC with $3,000,000 cash.  The Company owns 100% of TRLIC.  

Since incorporation, the Company has been involved in the sale of common stock to provide working capital.  The Company has completed an organizational offering, three private placement stock offerings and during 2014, initiated an intrastate public stock offering in the state of Texas.  The public stock offering intends to raise $25,000,000 by offering 5,000,000 of its common stock.

The Company raised $10,336,500 and incurred $1,215,569 of offering costs through the issuance and subscription of 12,865,000 shares from an organizational offering and three private placement offerings.  Through September 30, 2016, the Company has raised $7,353,735 and incurred $1,157,077 of offering costs through the issuance of 1,074,147 shares of the Company s common stock and subscription s of 396,600 shares from the intrastate public stock offering.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods have been included.

The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.  Certain financial information which is normally included in notes to consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but which is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s report on Form 10 and amendments thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiary.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.

1.            Organization and Significant Accounting Policies  (continued)

Investments

Fixed maturity securities are comprised of bonds that are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale is generally adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount.

Interest income, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included in net investment income under the effective yield method.  The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale is written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary.

The Company evaluates the difference between the cost or amortized cost and estimated fair value of its investments to determine whether any decline in value is other-than-temporary in nature.  This determination involves a degree of uncertainty.  If a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be temporary, the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in stockholders' equity.  If a decline in a security's fair value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the Company then determines the proper treatment for the other-than-temporary impairment.  For fixed maturity securities available-for-sale, the amount of any other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings and reflected as a reduction in the cost basis of the security; and the amount of any other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) with no change to the cost basis of the security.

The assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other-than-temporary includes management's judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security.  It is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired.  Future adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying investments and defaults on mortgage loan payments could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

Likewise, if a change occurs in the Company s intent to sell temporarily impaired securities prior to maturity or recovery in value, or if it becomes more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities prior to recovery in value or maturity, a future impairment charge could result.  If an other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss occurs with respect to a bond, the Company amortizes the reduced book value back to the security's expected recovery value over the remaining term of the bond.  The Company continues to review the security for further impairment that would prompt another write-down in the value.

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.  Interest earned on investments is recorded on the accrual basis and is included in net investment income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and money market instruments.

Advances and Notes Receivable

Notes receivable are recorded at unpaid principal balances.  Management evaluates the collectability of notes receivable on the specific identification basis. Uncollectible amounts are reported in the results of operations in the year the determination is made.

1.            Organization and Significant Accounting Policies  (continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Office furniture, equipment  and EDP equipment is recorded at cost or fair value at acquisition less accumulated depreciation or amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective assets of three to seven years.

Common Stock

Common stock is fully paid, non-assessable and has a par value of $.01 per share.

Federal Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Deferred income taxes are provided for cumulative temporary differences between balances of assets and liabilities determined under GAAP and balances determined using tax bases.

Offering Costs

Certain costs directly related to the sale of the Company's securities are capitalized against the proceeds from the sales. These costs include legal fees, recruiting and training expenses, commissions, printing, mailing and other expenses related to the offering.

Net Loss Per Common Share Issued and Subscribed

Net loss per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and subscribed during the year. Shares sold during the period are considered to be outstanding for one half of the month in which they were sold. The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 14,159,447 and 13,732,566 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 14,017,180 and 13,634,903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Subsequent Events

Management has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure in the financial statements through November 10, 2016, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to require lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability for leases with terms of more than 12 months.  The updated guidance retains the two classifications of a lease as either an operating or finance lease (previously referred to as a capital lease).  Both lease classifications require the lessee to record the right-to-use asset and the lease liability based upon the present value of cash flows.  Finance leases will reflect the financial arrangement by recognizing interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization expense of the right-to-use asset.  Operating leases will recognize lease expense (with no separate recognition of interest expense) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.   The accounting by lessors is not significantly changed by the updated guidance.  The updated guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and will require that the earliest comparative period presented include the measurement and recognition of existing leases with an adjustment to equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

2.             Investments  (continued) 

For securities in an unrealized loss position as of the financial statement dates, the estimated fair value, pre-tax gross unrealized loss and number of securities by length of time that those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of the fixed maturity securities had a fair value to amortized cost ratio equal to or greater than 82% and 72%, respectively.  Two fixed maturity securities with a par value of $250,000 are below investment grade as rated by Standard and Poor s as of September 30, 2016.  One fixed maturity security with a par value of $150,000 is below investment grade as rated by Standard and Poor s as of December 31, 2015.

The Company s decision to record an impairment loss is primarily based on whether the security s fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value based on all of the factors considered.  Factors that are considered include the length of time the security s fair value has been below its carrying amount, the severity of the decline in value, the credit worthiness of the issuer and the coupon and/or dividend payment history of the issuer.  The Company also assesses whether it intends to sell or whether it is more likely than not that it may be required to sell the security prior to its recovery in value.

For any fixed maturity securities that are other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company determines the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is credit-related and the portion that is related to other factors.  The credit-related portion is the difference between the expected future cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security and that difference is charged to earnings.  The non-credit-related portion representing the remaining difference to fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).

2.             Investments  (continued) 

Only in the case of a credit-related impairment where management has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, is a fixed maturity security adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses recognized in realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any other-than-temporary impairments on equity securities are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods incurred as the difference between fair value and cost.

Based on management s review, the Company experienced no other-than-temporary impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.

Management believes that the Company will fully recover its cost basis in the securities held as of September 30, 2016, and management does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities until they recover or mature.  The temporary impairments shown herein are primarily the result of the current interest rate environment rather than credit factors that would imply other-than-temporary impairment.

Net unrealized gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income (loss) for investments classified as available-for-sale are summarized as follows:

The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are summarized as follows:

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Major categories of net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:

3.            Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) on the measurement date.  The Company also considers the impact on fair value of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity.

The Company holds fixed maturity securities that are measured and reported at fair market value on the statement of financial position.  The Company determines the fair market values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:

Level 1   - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company has no Level 1 assets that would include securities traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2   - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  The Company s Level 2 assets and liabilities include fixed maturity securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or assets and liabilities whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.  This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities and corporate debt securities.

Level 3   - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  This category generally includes investments where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.

The Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into the three-level fair value hierarchy.  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis.  Changes in the valuation inputs, or their ability to be observed, may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting the levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in and out of the specific level category as of the beginning of the period in which the reclassifications occur.

3.             Fair Value Measurements  (continued) 

The Company s fair value hierarchy for those financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:

Fair values for Level 2 assets for the Company s fixed maturity securities available-for-sale are primarily based on prices supplied by a third party investment service.  The third party investment service provides quoted prices in the market which use observable inputs in developing such rates.

The Company analyzes market valuations received to verify reasonableness and to understand the key assumptions used and the sources.  Since the fixed maturity securities owned by the Company do not trade on a daily basis, the third party investment service prepares estimates of fair value measurements using relevant market data, benchmark curves, sector groupings and matrix pricing.  As the fair value estimates of the Company s fixed maturity securities are based on observable market information rather than market quotes, the estimates of fair value on these fixed maturity securities are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy.  The Company s Level 2 investments include corporate bonds.

The Company s fixed maturity securities available-for-sale portfolio is highly liquid and allows for a high percentage of the portfolio to be priced through pricing services.

3.             Fair Value Measurements  (continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount and fair value of the Company s financial assets disclosed, but not carried, at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the level within the fair value hierarchy at which such assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:

Financial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value:

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment was required to interpret market data to develop these estimates.  Accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts which could be realized in a current market exchange.  The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value disclosures for financial instruments in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto:

Fixed Maturity Securities

The fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on the principles previously discussed as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accrued Investment Income and Advances and Notes Receivable

The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair values due to the expected short-term nature until the cash settlement of these items.  Cash and cash equivalents are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy due to their highly liquid nature.  Accrued investment income and advances and notes receivable are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to little or no availability of market activity for these types of assets.

5.            Income Taxes 

The Company annually files federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.  Temporary differences between financial reporting and tax are not expected to be significant.  The 2013 through 2015 U.S. federal tax years are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities.

As of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized in the financial statements the effects of all tax positions and continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that make it reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Penalties and interest assessed by taxing authorities are included in the provision for income taxes, if applicable. There were no interest or penalties paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

A valuation allowance of $836,305 has been established for the amount of net operating losses arising from 2012 through September 30, 2016 since the Company has not demonstrated the ability to generate taxable income.

6.          Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company s cash is held at Plains Capital Bank in Austin, Texas, UBS Financial Services, Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky, First Financial Bank in Abilene, Texas and Amarillo National Bank in Amarillo, Texas.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures non-interest bearing accounts up to $250,000.  Uninsured balances aggregate $8,441,052 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company monitors the solvency of all financial institutions in which it has funds to minimize the exposure for loss.  The Company has not experienced any losses in this account and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

7.          Lease Commitment

The Company entered into a lease with a third party lessor in 2014 for utilization of office space in Austin, Texas.  The lease agreement was for the period May 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017.  The lease required a deposit in the amount of $3,992 and also abated the first month s rent.  The monthly rental payments are $2,432 for the first twelve months with annual increases of approximately 3% thereafter and the Company also pays a pro rata share of the operating expenses of the building.  Rent expense under the lease agreements was $41,971 and $37,232 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments and a pro rata share of the buildings operating expenses to be paid under non-cancellable lease agreements are $12,920 for October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and $21,533 in 2017.

Item 2:             Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Capitalization

Texas Republic Capital Corporation ( we   us ,  our ,  TRCC  or the  Company ) was incorporated in May 2012 as a financial services holding company.  Between May 2012 and November 2013, we conducted an organizational offering and three private placements of our common stock.  From the organizational offering and private placements, we raised $10,336,500, incurred $1,215,569 of offering costs and issued 12,865,000 of our common stock.  During 2012, the funds raised, offering costs incurred and shares subscribed from the private placements were $5,051,300, $180,835 and 10,636,840, respectively.  During 2013, the funds raised, offering costs incurred and shares subscribed from the private placements were $5,285,200, $1,034,734 and 2,228,160, respectively.

We began an intrastate public offering of our common stock at a price per share of $5.00 on April 2, 2014 and through the 30 month period ended September 30, 2016, we raised $7,353,735, incurred $1,157,077 of offering costs and issued 1,074,147 shares of our common stock and subscription s of 396,600 shares.  During 2014, the funds raised, offering costs incurred and shares subscribed from the offering were $3,143,800, $576,613 and 628,760, respectively.  During 2015, the funds raised, offering costs incurred and shares subscribed from the offering were $1,901,925, $326,734 and 380,385.  From January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the funds raised, offering costs incurred and shares subscribed from the offering were $2,308,010, $253,730 and 461,602.  Of the 1,470,747 shares subscribed during the intrastate public offering, the Company issued 1,074,147 shares of its common stock.

On August 1, 2016, Texas Republic Life Insurance Company s charter to become a life insurance company was approved by the Texas Department of Insurance.  TRLIC is 100% owned subsidiary of the Company.  TRLIC was capitalized with $3,000,000 cash by the Company and is expected to begin the sale of life insurance products in 2017.

We are a financial services holding company and have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,588,839. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred while raising capital. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until we achieve a volume of inforce life insurance policies that provides premiums that are sufficient to cover our operating costs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On a continuing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Income Taxes

We evaluate our deferred income tax assets, which partially offset our deferred tax liabilities, for any necessary valuation allowances. In doing so, we consider our ability and potential for recovering income taxes associated with such assets, which involve significant judgment. Revisions to the assumptions associated with any necessary valuation allowances would be recognized in the financial statements in the period in which such revisions are made.

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues

Our revenues come from investment income based on investments in fixed maturity available-for-sale securities.  We will likely not begin selling insurance products until 2017.  We expect to have revenues from sales of life insurance in the future.

18 

Table of Contents 

Total revenues were $23,086 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $167 from $22,919 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Expenses

Our expenses relate to operating a financial services holding company and a life insurance company.

Expenses were $280,953 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $85,919 from $195,034 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  An increase in professional fees, third-party administrative fees, bad debt, salaries and wages, office and other expenses, service and transfer agent fees and office rent in excess of a decline in director fees accounted for $84,062 of this increase.  We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as a result of administrative expenses necessary for the entry into the life insurance business.

Net Loss

The net loss was $257,867, or $(0.02) per common share issued and subscribed, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $172,115, or $(0.01) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $85,752 increase in the net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in expenses described above. We expect our losses to increase in the future as we incur increased costs to enter and grow into the life insurance business.  The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 14,159,447 and 13,732,566 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues

Our revenues come from investment income based on investments in fixed maturity available-for-sale securities.  We will likely not begin selling insurance products until 2017.  We expect to have revenues from sales of life insurance in the future.

Total revenues were $68,944 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $206 from $68,738 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Expenses

Our expenses relate to operating a financial services holding company and a life insurance company.

Expenses were $706,663 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $136,160 from $570,503 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  An increase in professional fees, third-party administrative fees, bad debt,  service and transfer agent fees, travel, meals and entertainment, office and other expenses, employee benefits, taxes, license and fees and office rent in excess of a decline in salaries and wages accounted for $135,411 of this increase.  We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as a result of administrative expenses necessary for the entry into the life insurance business.

Net Loss

The net loss was $637,719 or $(0.05) per common share issued and subscribed, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $501,765, or $(0.04) per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $135,954 increase in the net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in expenses described above. We expect our losses to increase in the future as we incur increased cost to enter and grow into the life insurance business.  The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 14,017,180 and 13,634,903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Financial Position   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015

Total assets of the Company increased from $11,321,876 as of December 31, 2015 to $12,870,453 as of September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,548,577.

The $135,058 increase in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in unrealized appreciation of $133,662.

Total shareholder equity of the Company increased from $11,303,028 as of December 31, 2015 to $12,853,251 as of September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,550,223.  The increase is due to proceeds from the public stock offering of $2,308,010 and increase in unrealized appreciation of $133,662 that exceeded a net loss from operations of $637,719 and offering costs of $253,730.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception, our operations have been financed primarily through an organizational offering, three private placement offerings and an intrastate public stock offering. Through September 30, 2016, we received $17,690,235 from the sale of 14,335,747 shares and incurred offering costs of $2,372,646.  Our operations have not been profitable and have generated significant operating losses since we were incorporated in 2012.

We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $10,385,672 and $8,975,991 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at multiple institutions.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures interest and non-interest bearing accounts up to $250,000.  Uninsured balances aggregate $8,441,052 and $7,846,083 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.  Other funds are invested in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities.  We monitor the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

Capital provided from the public offering will provide a considerable amount of operating funds for current and future operations.  The operations of TRLIC should provide ample cash flows from premium income and investment income to meet operating requirements.  Life insurance contract liabilities are generally long term in nature and are generally paid from future cash flows.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least 12 months. We have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The growth of TRLIC may require additional capital as it continues to grow.  As discussed above, the Company capitalized TRLIC with $3,000,000 cash during the third quarter of 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
