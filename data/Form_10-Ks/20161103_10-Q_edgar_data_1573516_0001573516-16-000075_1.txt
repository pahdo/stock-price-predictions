Note     1   Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of business     Murphy USA Inc. ( Murphy USA  or the  Company ) markets refined products through a network of retail gasoline stations and to unbranded wholesale customers. Murphy USA s owned retail stations are almost all located in close proximity to Walmart stores in   25   states and use the brand name Murphy USA . Murphy USA also markets gasoline and other products at standalone stations under the Murphy Express brand. At   September 30, 2016  , Murphy USA had a total of   1,364   Company stations.  
    
  Basis of Presentation     Murphy USA was incorporated in March 2013 and, in connection with its incorporation, Murphy USA issued   100   shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, to Murphy Oil Corporation ( Murphy Oil ) for   $1.00  . On August 30, 2013, Murphy USA was separated from Murphy Oil through the distribution of   100%   of the common stock of Murphy USA to holders of Murphy Oil stock.  
    
  In preparing the financial statements of Murphy USA in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
    
  Interim Financial Information     The interim period financial information presented in these consolidated financial statements is unaudited and includes all known accruals and adjustments, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of Murphy USA and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. 
    
  These interim consolidated financial statements should be read together with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (File No. 001-35914), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on February 26, 2016. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which amended existing accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets.  The amended guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted at the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and has applied this guidance prospectively to its deferred tax liabilities and assets. For the period ended December 31, 2015, current deferred tax liabilities of   $1.7 million   remain classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet.   
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets. Lessor accounting will remain similar to lessor accounting under previous GAAP, while aligning with the FASB s new revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. While this ASU will have impact on our internal processes and controls and result in a change to our accounting, we are still in the evaluation and information gathering stage of implementing the guidance and can not yet estimate the potential impact.    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting", which amends the current stock compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock based compensation, including adjustments to how excess tax benefits and a company s payments for tax withholdings should be classified. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. While we do not anticipate this ASU having a significant financial impact, we are currently evaluating the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and expect to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2017.

Note 2   Discontinued Operations 
    
  In September 2015, the Company determined that it had met held for sale criteria for its Hereford, Texas ethanol production facility.  On September 25, 2015, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell this subsidiary for a gain and the transaction closed on November 12, 2015.  
    
  The financial results of our Hereford plant for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   are presented as income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on our condensed consolidated statements of income.  The results of the Hereford ethanol plant were previously included along with "Corporate" as a reconciling item within our segment footnote prior to third quarter 2015.  The following table presents financial results of the Hereford business:

Note     3       Inventories 
    
  Inventories consisted of the following: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the replacement cost (market value) of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories exceeded the LIFO carrying value by   $131,505,000   and   $102,849,000  , respectively.  

Note     4       Long-Term Debt 
    
  Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Senior Notes 
    
  On August 14, 2013, Murphy Oil USA, Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, issued   6.00%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the  Senior Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of   $500 million  . The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Murphy USA, and are guaranteed by certain 100% owned subsidiaries that guarantee our credit facilities. The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments or investments, enter into transactions with affiliates or merge with or into other entities. 
    
  The Senior Notes and the guarantees rank equally with all of our and the guarantors  existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to our and the guarantors  existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness with respect to the credit facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.  The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future third-party liabilities, including trade payables, of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 

Credit Facilities 
    
  In March 2016, we amended and extended our existing credit agreement. The credit agreement provides for a committed     $450 million   asset-based loan (ABL) facility (with availability subject to the borrowing base described below) and a     $200 million   term loan facility.   It also provides for a   $150 million      uncommitted  incremental  facility.   On March 10, 2016,     Murphy Oil USA, Inc. borrowed     $200 million   under the term loan facility that has a   four  -year term.    
  
   8 

    Murphy USA Inc. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The borrowing base is, at any time of determination, the amount (net of reserves) equal to the sum of: 
    
           100%   of eligible cash at such time, plus 
           90%   of eligible credit card receivables at such time, plus 
           90%   of eligible investment grade accounts, plus 
           85%   of eligible other accounts, plus 
           80%   of eligible product supply/wholesale refined products inventory at such time, plus 
           75%   of eligible retail refined products inventory at such time, plus 
    
  the lesser of (i)   70%   of the average cost of eligible retail merchandise inventory at such time and (ii)   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible retail merchandise inventory at such time. 
    
  The ABL facility includes a   $200 million   sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Letters of credit issued under the ABL facility reduce availability under the ABL facility. 
     
  Interest payable on the credit facilities is based on either: 

the London interbank offered rate, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (the  Adjusted LIBO Rate  or 
                
    the Alternate Base Rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus   0.50%   per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted LIBO Rate plus   1.00%   per annum, 
       
  plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted LIBO Rate borrowings, (i) with respect to the ABL facility, spreads ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio under the ABL facility or (ii) with respect to the term loan facility, spreads ranging from   2.50%   to   2.75%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, (i) with respect to the ABL facility, spreads ranging from   0.50%   to   1.00%   per annum depending on total debt to EBITDA ratio or (ii) with respect to the term loan facility, spreads ranging from   1.50%   to   1.75%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio. 
    
  The interest rate period with respect to the Adjusted LIBO Rate interest rate option can be set at   one  ,   two  ,   three  , or   six   months as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. 
    
  We were obligated to make quarterly amortization payments on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility beginning on July 1, 2016 equal to   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of term loans made on March 10, 2016, with the remaining balance payable on the scheduled maturity date of the term loan facility. Borrowings under the credit facilities are prepayable at our option without premium or penalty. We are also required to prepay the term loan facility with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or casualty events, subject to certain exceptions. The credit agreement also includes certain customary mandatory prepayment provisions with respect to the ABL facility. 
    
  The credit agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions, to make certain restricted payments, to enter into consolidations, mergers or sales of material assets and other fundamental changes, to transact with affiliates, to enter into agreements restricting the ability of subsidiaries to incur liens or pay dividends, or to make certain accounting changes. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of a minimum of   1.0   to 1.0 when availability for at least   three   consecutive business days is less than the greater of (a)   17.5%   of the lesser of the aggregate ABL facility commitments and the borrowing base and (b)   $70,000,000   (including as of the most recent fiscal quarter end on the first date when availability is less than such amount), as well as a maximum secured total debt to EBITDA ratio of   4.5   to 1.0 at any time when the term loans are outstanding.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our fixed charge coverage ratio was   0.64  ; however, we had   no   debt outstanding under the ABL facility at that date so the fixed charge coverage ratio currently has no impact on our operations or liquidity.          
    
  After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on certain payments, which could include dividends, under the credit agreement (which restrictions are only applicable when availability under the credit agreement does not exceed the greater of   25%   of the lesser of the revolving commitments and the borrowing base and   $100 million   (and if availability under the credit agreement does not exceed the greater of   40%   of the lesser of the revolving commitments and the borrowing base and   $100 million  , then our fixed charge coverage ratio must be at least   1.0   to

1.0)) and the indenture, and subject to compliance with applicable law.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a shortfall of approximately   $245.7 million   of its net income and retained earnings subject to such restrictions before the fixed charge coverage ratio would exceed   1.0   to 1.0. 
    
  All obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Murphy USA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and all obligations under the credit agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain assets of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the guarantors party thereto. 

Note     5       Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) 
  The majority of the ARO recognized by the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   related to the estimated costs to dismantle and abandon certain of its retail gasoline stations. The Company has not recorded an ARO for certain of its marketing assets because sufficient information is presently not available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates for the obligation. These assets are consistently being upgraded and are expected to be operational into the foreseeable future. In these cases, the obligation will be initially recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate the obligation. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate carrying amount of the ARO is shown in the following table. 

The estimation of future ARO is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment. The Company cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that may be required in future periods due to the lack of availability of additional information. 

Note     6  Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate is calculated as the amount of income tax expense divided by income before income tax expense. For the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s effective tax rates were as follows: 

The effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was higher than the U.S. Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to U.S. state tax expense while the effective rates for the prior year periods were higher than the statutory rate primarily due to certain discrete items that impacted income taxes in the period in addition to U.S. state tax expense.          
    
  The Company was included in Murphy Oil s tax returns for the periods prior to the separation in multiple jurisdictions that remain subject to audit by taxing authorities. These audits often take years to complete and settle. As of   September 30, 2016  , the earliest year remaining open for Federal audit and/or settlement is   2012   and for the states it ranges from   2008  -  2011  .  Although the Company believes that recorded liabilities for unsettled issues are adequate, additional gains or losses could occur in future periods from resolution of outstanding unsettled matters.

Note     7       Incentive Plans 
  2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
  Effective August 30, 2013, certain of our employees participate in the Murphy USA 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan which was subsequently amended and restated effective as of February 12, 2014 (the  MUSA 2013 Plan ). The MUSA 2013 Plan authorizes the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors ( the Committee ) to grant non-qualified or incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), cash awards, and performance awards to our employees. No more than   5.5 million   shares of MUSA common stock may be delivered under the MUSA 2013 Plan and no more than   1 million   shares of common stock may be awarded to any one employee, subject to adjustment for changes in capitalization. The maximum cash amount payable pursuant to any  performance-based  award to any participant in any calendar year is   $5 million  . 
    
  On February 10, 2016, the Committee granted nonqualified stock options for   96,500   shares at an exercise price of   $59.11   per share under the terms of the MUSA 2013 Plan.  The   Black-Scholes   valuation for these awards is   $16.08   per option.  The Committee also awarded time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (performance units) to certain employees on the same date.   There were   26,650   time-based restricted units granted at a grant date fair value of   $59.11   along with   53,300   performance units.  Half of the performance units vest based on a   3  -year return on average capital employed (ROACE) calculation and the other half vest based on a   3  -year total shareholder return (TSR) calculation that compares MUSA to a group of   16   peer companies.  The portion of the awards that vest based on TSR qualify as a market condition and must be valued using a   Monte Carlo   valuation model.  For the TSR portion of the awards, the fair value was determined to be   $82.94   per unit.  For the ROACE portion of the awards, the valuation will be based on the grant date fair value of   $59.11   per unit and the number of awards will be periodically assessed to determine the probability of vesting.  
    
  On February 10, 2016, the Committee also granted   45,475   time-based restricted stock units granted to certain employees with a grant date fair value of   $59.11   per unit.  
    
  2013 Stock Plan for Non-employee Directors 
    
  Effective August 8, 2013, Murphy USA adopted the 2013 Murphy USA Stock Plan for Non-employee Directors (the  Directors Plan ).  The directors for Murphy USA are compensated with a mixture of cash payments and equity-based awards.  Awards under the Directors Plan may be in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, or a combination thereof.  An aggregate of   500,000   shares of common stock shall be available for issuance of grants under the Directors Plan.  
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued   19,900   restricted stock units to its non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of   $59.14   per share.  These shares vest in   three   years from the grant date.  
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , share based compensation was   $6.9 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively.  The income tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 million  .  

Note 8  Financial Instruments and Risk Management 
    
  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS   The Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage certain risks related to commodity prices. The use of derivative instruments for risk management is covered by operating policies and is closely monitored by the Company s senior management. The Company does not hold any derivatives for speculative purposes and it does not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features. Derivative instruments are traded primarily with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ).  As of   September 30, 2016  , all current derivative activity is immaterial.   

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash deposits of   $1.7 million   and   $1.6 million   related to commodity derivative contracts were reported in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. These cash deposits have not been used to increase the reported net assets or reduce the reported net liabilities on the derivative contracts at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Note 9   Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share adjusts basic earnings per common share for the effects of stock options and restricted stock in the periods where such items are dilutive.  
    
  On January 25, 2016, the Company announced that it would proceed with an independent growth plan apart from Walmart rather than continue to acquire land from Walmart.

Note 11       Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
    
  The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value hierarchy is based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants. 
    
  At the balance sheet date the fair value of derivative contracts were determined using NYMEX quoted values but were immaterial.   
    
  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable-trade, Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities, all of which had fair values approximating carrying amounts. The fair value of Current and Long-term debt was estimated based on rates offered to the Company at that time for debt of the same maturities. The Company has off-balance sheet exposures relating to certain financial guarantees and letters of credit. The fair value of these, which represents fees associated with obtaining the instruments, was nominal.   

Note 12   Contingencies    
    
  The Company s operations and earnings have been and may be affected by various forms of governmental action. Examples of such governmental action include, but are by no means limited to: tax increases and retroactive tax claims; import and export controls; price controls; allocation of supplies of crude oil and petroleum products and other goods; laws and regulations intended for the promotion of safety and the protection and/or remediation of the environment; governmental support for other forms of energy; and laws and regulations affecting the Company s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, stockholders and others. Because governmental actions are often motivated by political considerations, may be taken without full consideration of their consequences, and may be taken in response to actions of other governments, it is not practical to attempt to predict the likelihood of such actions, the form the actions may take or the effect such actions may have on the Company. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LEGAL MATTERS   Murphy USA is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations dealing with the environment. Violation of such environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and other sanctions. A discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject the Company to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury, property damage and other losses that might result. 
    
  The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled. Although the Company believes it has used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the Company or on or under other locations where they have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose management of hazardous substances was not under the Company s control. Under existing laws the Company could be required to remediate contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial actions to prevent future contamination. Certain of these contaminated properties are in various stages of negotiation, investigation, and/or cleanup, and the Company is investigating the extent of any related liability and the availability of applicable defenses. With the sale of the U.S. refineries in 2011, Murphy Oil retained certain liabilities related to environmental matters. Murphy Oil also obtained insurance covering certain levels of  
  
   14 

    Murphy USA Inc. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

environmental exposures. The Company believes costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse effect on Murphy USA s net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. 
    
  Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at   September 30, 2016  , however certain jurisdictions provide reimbursement for these expenses which have been considered in recording the net exposure.   
    
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently considers the Company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at   one   Superfund site. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at this site may be substantial. However, based on current negotiations and available information, the Company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the Superfund site. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs at the Superfund site at   September 30, 2016  . The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at this site or other Superfund sites. The Company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean-up this site will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. 
    
  Based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs to be incurred to address known contamination sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s future net income, cash flows or liquidity. However, there is the possibility that additional environmental expenditures could be required to address contamination, including as a result of discovering additional contamination or the imposition of new or revised requirements applicable to known contamination. 
    
  Other than as noted above, Murphy USA is engaged in a number of other legal proceedings, all of which the Company considers routine and incidental to its business. Based on information currently available to the Company, the ultimate resolution of those other legal matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. 
    
  INSURANCE   The Company maintains insurance coverage at levels that are customary and consistent with industry standards for companies of similar size. Murphy USA maintains statutory workers compensation insurance with a deductible of   $1.0 million   per occurrence and other insurance programs for general and auto liability. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were a number of outstanding claims that are of a routine nature. The estimated incurred but unpaid liabilities relating to these claims are included in Trade account payables and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot presently be determined, management believes that the accrued liability of   $19.0 million   will be sufficient to cover the related liability for all insurance claims and that the ultimate disposition of these claims will have no material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
    
  The Company has obtained insurance coverage as appropriate for the business in which it is engaged, but may incur losses that are not covered by insurance or reserves, in whole or in part, and such losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  TAX MATTERS   Murphy USA is subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities because of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. 
    
  OTHER MATTERS   In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had contingent liabilities of   $16.9 million   on outstanding letters of credit. The Company has not accrued a liability in its balance sheet related to these financial guarantees and letters of credit because it is believed that the likelihood of having these drawn is remote.

Note 13   Business Segment 
    
  The Company's operations have   one   operating segment which is Marketing.  The operations include the sale of retail motor fuel products and convenience merchandise along with the wholesale and bulk sale capabilities of our product supply and wholesale group.  As the primary purpose of the product supply and wholesale group is to support our retail operations and provide fuel for their daily operation, the bulk and wholesale fuel sales are secondary to the support functions played by these groups.  As such, they are all treated as   one   segment for reporting purposes as they sell the same products.  This Marketing segment contains essentially all of the revenue generating functions of the Company.  Results not included in the reportable segment include Corporate and Other Assets and Discontinued Operations.  The reportable segment was determined based on information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).

It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the Company s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions. The words  anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   budget,   continue,   could,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   predict,   seek,   should,   will,   would,   expect,   objective,   projection,   forecast,   goal,   guidance,   outlook,   effort,   target  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s disclosures under  Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  For purposes of this Management s Discussion and Analysis, references to  Murphy USA , the  Company ,  we ,  us  and  our  refer to Murphy USA Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  For periods prior to completion of the separation from Murphy Oil Corporation ( Murphy Oil ), these terms refer to Murphy Oil s U.S. retail marketing business and other assets and liabilities that were contributed to Murphy USA in connection with the separation, including an allocable portion of Murphy Oil s corporate costs, on a combined basis. 
    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis is organized as follows: 

Executive Overview   This section provides an overview of our business and the results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. It includes information on the basis of presentation with respect to the amounts presented in the Management s Discussion and Analysis and a discussion of the trends affecting our business.

    Critical Accounting Policies   This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. 
       
  Executive Overview 
    
  The following MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.  This section is provided to supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to these financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this MD A section and the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our Form 10-K contains a discussion of matters not included within this document, such as disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates, and contractual obligations.  
    
  Our Business 
    
  We market refined products through a network of retail gasoline stations and to unbranded wholesale customers. Our owned retail stations are almost all located in close proximity to Walmart stores and use the brand name Murphy USA . We also market gasoline and other products at standalone stations under the Murphy Express brand. At   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of   1,364   Company stations in   25   states, principally in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States.   
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Murphy USA was incorporated in March 2013, and until the separation from Murphy Oil was completed on August 30, 2013, it had not commenced operations and had no material assets, liabilities or commitments.  The financial information presented in this Management s Discussion and Analysis is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Murphy USA Inc. and its subsidiaries for all periods presented.  
  
   26 

The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial results as an independent company for all periods subsequent to the separation.  
    
  Trends Affecting Our Business 
    
  Our operations are significantly impacted by the gross margins we receive on our fuel sales. These gross margins are commodity-based, change daily and are volatile. While we expect our total fuel sales volumes to grow and the gross margins we realize on those sales to remain strong, these gross margins can change rapidly due to many factors.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the price of refined products, interruptions in supply caused by severe weather, severe refinery mechanical failures for an extended period of time, and competition in the local markets in which we operate.  
    
  The cost of our main sales products, gasoline and diesel, is greatly impacted by the cost of crude oil in the United States. Generally, rising prices for crude oil increase the Company s cost for wholesale fuel products purchased. When wholesale fuel costs rise, the Company is not always able to immediately pass these cost increases on to its retail customers at the pump, which in turn squeezes the Company s sales margin. Also, rising prices tend to cause our customers to reduce discretionary fuel consumption, which tends to reduce our fuel sales volumes. Retail fuel margins were weaker in the current year quarter due to a rising wholesale price environment. The upward trending wholesale price coincided with the September Colonial pipeline disruption to impact both fuel volumes and margins.  The prior year quarter was a period of declining wholesale costs which caused more opportunity for increased margin.   As it relates to our merchandise cost of sales, we implemented a new supply agreement with Core-Mark in February 2016 that has provided margin improvement and uplift compared to our prior supply deal and is expected to continue until early 2017 when we begin to cycle against the 2016 impact.         
    
  In addition, our cost of goods sold is impacted by our ability to leverage our diverse supply infrastructure in pursuit of obtaining the lowest cost fuel supply available; for example, activities such as blending bulk fuel with ethanol and bio-diesel to capture and subsequently sell Renewable Identification Numbers ( RINs ).  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is authorized to set annual quotas establishing the percentage of motor fuels consumed in the United States that must be attributable to renewable fuels. Obligated parties are required to demonstrate that they have met any applicable quotas by submitting a certain amount of RINs to the EPA. RINs in excess of the set quota (as well as RINs generated by companies that are not subject to quotas) can be sold in a market for RINs at then-prevailing prices. The market price for RINs fluctuates based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to governmental and regulatory action. In recent historical periods, we have benefited from our ability to attain RINs and sell them at favorable prices in the market; however, there are other market related factors that can impact the net benefit we receive from RINs on a company-wide basis either favorably or unfavorably.  Our business model does not depend on our ability to generate revenues from RINs.  Revenue from the sales of RINs is included in  Other operating revenue  in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  
    
  In March 2016, we amended and extended our existing $450 million asset based credit facility and modified some of the covenants to be slightly more favorable to the Company.   As part of the amendment, we borrowed a term loan for $200 million that has a four year term.  We believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect to use the credit facilities to provide us with available financing intended to meet any ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows. To the extent necessary, we will borrow under these facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements. At   September 30, 2016  , we have additional available capacity under the committed $450 million credit facilities (subject to the borrowing base), together with capacity under a $150 million incremental uncommitted facility. There can be no assurances, however, that we will generate sufficient cash from operations or be able to draw on the credit facilities, obtain commitments for our incremental facility and/or obtain and draw upon other credit facilities. 
    
  On December 21, 2012, we signed an agreement with Walmart providing for the potential purchase of land to develop new Company stations located adjacent to existing Walmart stores in Walmart s core market area covering the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States. The construction program is expected to be completed in 2017 relative to the 2012 sites. In connection with this agreement, we expect to incur additional station operating and depreciation expenses due to the addition of new stores. However, we can provide no assurance that we will develop all additional sites as contemplated under the agreement.  See  Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Our ability to continue to generate revenue and operating income depends on our continued relationship with Walmart  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company currently anticipates total capital expenditures  
  
   27 

(including purchases of Walmart properties and other land for future developments) for the full year 2016 to range from approximately $250 million to $300 million depending on how many new sites are developed.  We intend to fund the remainder of our capital program in 2016 primarily using operating cash flow but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities.    
    
  We believe that our business will continue to grow in the future as we expect to build additional locations in close proximity to Walmart stores and other locations. The pace of this growth is continually monitored by our management, and these plans can be altered based on operating cash flows generated and the availability of debt facilities. 
    
  On May 18, 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) released its final rule increasing the minimum salary that employees must be paid to qualify as exempt from the overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  The new rule increases the salary threshold for the overtime exemption from $455 per week to $913 per week.  On an annual basis, this increases the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 per year.  These regulations become effective December 1, 2016. The DOL will automatically update the standard salary and compensation levels every three years going forward.  The Company has undertaken an evaluation of the requirements and compared the options available to our existing employee base.  Based on the approach determined to be best suited for our employees and our business, we believe the ultimate financial impact to the Company of these FLSA changes will be immaterial to the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year of 2017.  
    
  We currently estimate our ongoing effective tax rate to be approximately 37.7% for the remainder of the year.  
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Our business has inherent seasonality due to the concentration of our retail sites in certain geographic areas, as well as customer activity behaviors during different seasons.  In general, sales volumes and operating incomes are highest in the second and third quarters during the summer activity months and lowest during the winter months.  As a result, operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Business Segment 
    
  The Company has one operating segment which is Marketing.  This segment includes our retail marketing sites and product supply and wholesale assets.   
    
  For additional operating segment information, see Note 21  Business Segments  in the audited combined financial statements for the three year period ended December 31, 2015 included with our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 13  Business Segment  in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Consolidated     Results 
    
  For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported net income of   $45.5 million   or   $1.16   per diluted share on revenue of   $3.04 billion  .  Net income was   $60.5 million   for the same period in   2015   or   $1.41   per diluted share on   $3.38 billion   in revenue. Included as a part of net income for the 2015 period was income from discontinued operations of    $0.5 million   related to the Hereford ethanol plant.   
    
  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported net income of   $177.7 million   or   $4.44   per diluted share on revenue of   $8.54 billion  .  Net income was   $109.7 million   for the same period in 2015 or   $2.47   per diluted share on   $9.77 billion   in revenue.  Included as a part of net income for the 2015 period was income from discontinued operations of   $1.3 million   related to Hereford while the 2016 period contained a large gain on sale of assets related to the disposition of the CAM pipeline interest in Q1 2016.   

28 

Three     Months     Ended     September 30, 2016     versus Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Quarterly revenues for   2016   decreased   $0.34 billion  , or   10.0%  , compared to Q  3     2015  .  The lower revenues were caused by lower retail and wholesale fuel prices in 2016.  Partially offsetting these lower fuel revenues was an increase in store count in 2016, which resulted in slightly higher overall retail fuel volumes and higher merchandise sales.  In addition, higher RIN values also contributed to the increase.   
    
  Total cost of sales decreased   $0.32 billion  , or   10.3%  , compared to   2015  .  This decline is primarily due to lower fuel purchase costs in all areas in the   2016   quarter.  Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in merchandise and fuel cost of sales for the increased store count in   2016  . 
    
  Operating expenses increased   $6.4 million   or   5.3%   from   2015  .  This increase was driven by higher absolute payment fees, maintenance costs and promotional costs during the 2016 period partially due to higher store count.     
    
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses for   2016   decreased   $2.3 million  , or   6.9%  , from   2015  .  The decrease in SG A costs is due to lower professional service fees related to various ongoing projects partially offset by higher labor and employee benefits.         
    
  Income tax expense for   2016   was lower than   2015   due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate was   36.6%   for the   2016   quarter and   36.2%   for the   2015   quarter.   The higher effective rate in the current quarter was primarily due to certain discrete items that impacted the 2015 quarter that did not repeat.   
      
  Nine     Months     Ended     September 30, 2016     versus Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues for   2016   decreased   $1.23 billion  , or   12.6%  , compared to   2015  .  The lower revenues were caused by lower retail and wholesale fuel prices in 2016.  Partially offsetting these lower fuel revenues was an increase in store count in 2016, which led to slightly higher overall retail fuel volumes and higher merchandise sales.  In addition, higher RIN values also added to the increase.   
    
  Total cost of sales decreased   $1.27 billion  , or   14.1%  , compared to   2015  .  This decline is primarily due to lower fuel purchase costs in all areas in   2016  .  Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in merchandise and fuel cost of sales for the increased store count in   2016  . 
    
  Operating expenses increased   $11.4 million   or   3.2%   from   2015  .  This increase was driven by higher absolute labor and benefit costs due to more stores open during   2016   although labor costs are lower on a per store basis in 2016.  Higher payment fees and maintenance costs in the current period also contributed to this year-to-date increase.    
    
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses for 2016 decreased   $2.4 million  , or   2.5%  , from   2015  .  The decrease in SG A costs is due to lower professional service fees related to various ongoing projects partially offset by higher labor and employee benefits for non-store level positions.         
    
  Income tax expense for   2016   was higher than   2015   due to higher pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate was   37.7%   for 2016 and   37.6%   for 2015.   The slightly higher effective rate in the current year was primarily due to certain discrete items that impacted the first half of 2015 that did not repeat.   
    
  A summary of the Company s earnings by business segment follows:

Three     Months     Ended     September 30, 2016     versus Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net income for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased compared to the same period in   2015     primarily due to: 

Lower retail fuel margin per gallon 
                
    Slightly higher total operating expenses 
                
    Increased interest expense due to addition of term loan 

The items below partially offset the decrease in earnings in the current period:  

Lower income tax expense due to lower pre-tax earnings 
                
    Higher merchandise gross margin dollars 
                
    Higher RINs income 
       
  Nine     Months     Ended     September 30, 2016     versus Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net income for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same period in   2015     primarily due to: 
             
    Gain on sale of CAM pipeline system 
                
    Higher RINs income 
                
    Higher merchandise gross margin dollars 
                
    Increased total retail fuel volumes

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Net income in the Marketing segment     for   2016   decreased   $13.0 million   over the     2015   period. The primary reason for this decline was a reduction in retail fuel margins and higher operating expenses partially offset by  higher total retail fuel sales volumes,  higher merchandise margins and increased RINs income.       Quarterly chain  
  
   31 

wide retail fuel sales volumes increased   1.2%   to   1.09 billion   gallons sold in   2016   compared to   1.08 billion   gallons sold in   2015  .          
  Quarterly merchandise margins in   2016     were     higher than     2015  .      The increase in gross margin dollars of   10.8%   in the current period was due primarily to benefits recognized from the Core-Mark supply contract, in addition to per store improvements and improved promotional effectiveness.  As a result, total unit margins were up by 140 basis points from   14.6%   in the prior period to a third consecutive quarterly record of   16.0%  .   
  Also impacting net income in the   2016   period was the sale of RINs of   $48.0 million   compared to   $20.0 million   in   2015  .  During the   2016   quarter,   54 million   RINs were sold at an average selling price of   $0.89   per RIN before consideration of other market factors that might negatively impact total income from PS W. 
  Total revenues for the Marketing segment were approximately   $3.0 billion   for     2016   and   $3.4 billion   for   2015  . Revenues     included excise taxes collected and remitted to government authorities of   $506 million   in     2016   and   $513 million   in   2015  .      The cause of the significant decline in revenues was a $0.28 per gallon reduction in retail fuel price in the   2016   quarter.        
  Total fuel sales volumes per station were down   3.9%   to   268,259     gallons per     store     month in the   2016     period from   279,086     gallons per     store     month in     2015  .    This decline continues to reflect the impact from a higher mix of Midwest locations that historically perform below the chain average.  Retail f  uel margin declined   24.3%   in the   2016   quarter to   13.7   cpg, compared to   18.1   cpg in the prior year     quarter. Retail fuel margins were pressured by flat to rising wholesale prices compared to a large decline in the 2015 quarter.  
  Merchandise total sales increased   1.2%     to     $599.0 million   in     2016   from   $591.6 million   in   2015   despite a decrease in non-tobacco sales of   2.4%   average per store month (APSM) combined with a decrease in tobacco products revenue of   4.3%   APSM.     Merchandise margins were higher at   16.0%   for the current period due primarily to higher cigarette margins due to price increases in certain jurisdictions.  
  Total product supply and wholesale margin dollars excluding RINs were negative   $29.0 million   in the   2016   period compared to negative   $22.4 million   in   2015  . The decrease in the current period was largely caused by a negative spot-to-rack differential, which is a direct reflection of higher RIN prices embedded in refined product spot prices.   
    
  Station and other     operating expenses increased   $6.4 million   in the current period compared to     2015     levels.  Total operating expenses in 2015 were slightly reduced by a one-time item that did not repeat in the current year.  On an APSM basis, expenses applicable to retail declined 1.9%, primarily because of lower labor costs in the period along with slightly higher maintenance per store which includes some refresh activities  .  
  Depreciation expense increased   $3.6 million   in the   2016     period, an increase of   17.5%     over the prior period. This increase was primarily caused by more stores operating in the   2016     period compared to the prior year     period. 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A)     expenses decreased   $2.3 million  , or   6.9%  , in     2016  .      This     decrease was primarily due to     lower professional services fees related to ongoing projects partially offset by   higher labor, travel and training  .     
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Net income in the Marketing segment     for   2016   increased   $74.6 million   over   2015  . The primary reason for this improvement was the gain on sale of the CAM pipeline in the current year along with higher total retail fuel sales volumes and higher merchandise margins partially offset by income taxes on the higher pre-tax income amounts.      Chain wide retail fuel sales volumes increased   2.6%   to   3.13 billion   gallons sold in   2016   compared to   3.05 billion   gallons sold in   2015  .          
  Merchandise margins in   2016     were     higher than     2015  .      The increase in gross margin dollars of   12.6%   in the current year was due primarily to benefits recognized from the Core-Mark supply contract, in addition to per store improvements and improved promotional effectiveness.  As a result, total unit margins were up by 130 basis points from   14.4%   in the prior period to   15.7%  .   
  Also impacting net income in   2016   was the sale of RINs of   $130.7 million   compared to   $93.9 million   in   2015  .  During   2016  ,   165 million   RINs were sold at an average selling price of   $0.79   per RIN before consideration of other market factors that might negatively impact total income from PS W. 
  Total revenues for the Marketing segment were approximately   $8.5 billion   for     2016   and   $9.8 billion   for   2015  . Revenues     included excise taxes collected and remitted to government authorities of   $1.47 billion   in     2016   and  
  
   32 

$1.46 billion   in   2015  .      The cause of the significant decline in revenues was a $0.36 per gallon reduction in retail fuel price in   2016  .        
  Total fuel sales volumes per station were down   2.4%   to   259,681     gallons per     store     month in   2016     from   266,034     gallons per     store     month in     2015  .    Retail f  uel margin declined   4.8%   in   2016    to   11.9   cpg, compared to   12.5   cpg in the prior year. Retail fuel margins were pressured by increasing wholesale prices over the nine month period compared to more volatility in   2015  .  
  Merchandise total sales increased   3.7%     to     $1.75 billion   in     2016   from   $1.69 billion   in   2015   because of an increase in non-tobacco sales of   3.7%   average per store month (APSM) combined with a decrease in tobacco products revenue of   2.9%   APSM.     Merchandise margins were higher at   15.7%   for the current year due primarily to higher cigarette margins.  
  Total product supply and wholesale margin dollars excluding RINs were negative   $20.8 million   in   2016   compared to negative   $9.0 million   in   2015  . The decrease in the current year reflected inventory and timing variances which were negative versus prior year.    When considering RINs in conjunction with product supply and wholesale margins, the margin dollars are higher than prior year by 29.5%.       
    
  Station and other     operating expenses increased   $11.4 million   in the current year compared to     2015     levels primarily due to more total stores in operation.  On an APSM basis, expenses applicable to retail declined 1.4%, primarily because of lower labor costs in the period along with flat maintenance on a per store basis, including the impact of store refresh costs. 
  Depreciation expense increased   $7.7 million   in   2016  , an increase of   12.8%     over the prior year. This increase was primarily caused by more stores operating in   2016  . 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A)     expenses decreased   $2.4 million  , or   2.5%  , in     2016  .      This     decrease was primarily due to     lower professional services fees related to ongoing projects partially offset by   higher labor, travel and training  .     
    
  Same store sales comparison 

Historically, the Company has used the APSM metric to represent certain data on a per site basis.  The APSM metric includes all stores open through the date of the calculation.  Other retailers have used same store sales (SSS) as their metric.  The table above shows the comparison of APSM to SSS for 3 specific items.  In most cases, the SSS metric is more favorable than the APSM metric.  The primary reason for this is that SSS does not include new stores that have been opened a short time and are still developing their customer base.  The difference between the APSM and SSS results highlights the impact of our growing mix of small store formats (e.g. 1200 sq. ft.) which have a higher mix of non tobacco sales and a ramp up period on tobacco sales.  
  The same store sales comparison includes aggregated individual store results for all stores open throughout both periods presented.  For all periods presented, the store must have been open for the entire calendar year to be included in the comparison.  Remodeled stores that remained open or were closed for just a very brief time (less than a month) during the period being compared remain in the same store sales calculation.  If a store is replaced,  
  
   33 

either at the same location (raze and rebuild) or relocated to a new location, it will typically be excluded from the calculation during the period it is out of service.  Newly constructed sites do not enter the calculation until they are open for each full calendar year for the periods being compared (open by January 1, 2015 for the sites being compared in the   2016   versus   2015   calculations).  
    
  Corporate and other assets 
    
  Three     Months     Ended   September 30, 2016   versus Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  After-tax results for Corporate and other assets were lower in the recently completed quarter to a loss of   $7.3 million   compared to a loss of   $5.8 million   in the     third     quarter of   2015  .  This change was partially due to the   2016   period containing higher interest expense than the prior year quarter due to the $200 million term loan taken out in 2016.  In the     third     quarter of   2016  , interest expense within the Corporate area was   $10.2 million   compared to expense of   $8.4 million   in the same quarter of   2015  .  
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Corporate and other assets decreased to a loss of   $20.9 million   in   2016   compared to a lower loss of   $15.7 million   in   2015  .  The larger loss is due to interest expense within the Corporate area of   $29.8 million   in   2016   compared to expense of   $25.0 million   in   2015  .    The higher interest in the current year is due to the new term loan of $200 million drawn in   2016  .  
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Three     Months     Ended   September 30, 2016   versus Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  While there were no discontinued operations in the current quarter, the   2015   quarter contained the operations of the Hereford ethanol plant operations.  During Q3   2015  , the Company had income of   $0.5 million   related to Hereford due to an unfavorable crush spread environment.   
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  No discontinued operations have been recognized in 2016.  The 2015 period had income of   $1.3 million   from the operations of the Hereford ethanol plant.   
    
  Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s Adjusted EBITDA for the   three and nine   months ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  EBITDA means net income (loss) plus net interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA adds back (i) other non-cash items (e.g., impairment of properties and accretion of asset retirement obligations) and (ii) other items that management does not consider to be meaningful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., (income) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of assets and other non-operating expense (income)).  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures that are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
    
  We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in our operational and financial decision-making, believing that such measures are useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by many of our investors, research analysts, investment bankers, and lenders to assess our operating performance.  However, non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures, and Adjusted EBITDA may be prepared differently by us than by other companies using similarly titled non-GAAP measures. 

34 

The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA follows: 

The Company also considers free cash flow in the operation of its business.  Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for us in evaluating the Company s performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  
    
  Numerous methods may exist to calculate a company s free cash flow.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow.  The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow:  

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  Significant Sources of Capital 
    
  We continue to have a     committed     $450 million asset based loan facility (the  ABL facility ) (subject to the borrowing base) and a $200 million term loan facility, as well as a $150 million incremental uncommitted facility.     Only   the $200 million term loan is outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .      At     September 30, 2016     we had $192 million of borrowing capacity under the ABL facility that we could utilize for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to     support our operating model as described herein.  See  Debt   Credit Facilities  for the calculation of our borrowing base.  
  We believe our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our operations, but also our anticipated near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, execution of announced share repurchase programs, potential dividend payments, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. 
  
   35 

Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $210 million   for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     and     $149 million   for the comparable period in     2015  , higher     primarily because of   a decrease in prepaids and lower accounts payable  .      Net income increased   $68.0 million   in 2016     compared to the corresponding period in     2015     and the amount of cash generated from adjustments of working capital in the 2016     period increased by $5 million.      Cash flows from operating activities also included cash flows from discontinued operations of   $11 million   in   2015  .      
  Investing Activities 
    
  For the   nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , cash required by investing activities was   $74 million   compared to     $159 million   in   2015  . The     lower investing cash use in the current period was primarily due to     higher capital expenditure     spending in the current period to build new retail locations and acquisition of land for future growth more than offset by the proceeds from the sale of assets and changes in restricted cash.  
     Financing Activities 
    
  Financing activities in the     nine     months     ended     September 30, 2016   used   cash of   $31 million   compared to use of   $252 million   in the     nine     months     ended   September 30  , 2015. Cash was generated from the borrowing of a $200 million term loan in 2016 but was more than offset by the repurchase of common shares in the current period of   $212 million  .          
  Share Repurchase Authorization 
  On January 25, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized up to $500 million for a share repurchase program of the Company s common stock along with funding for new additional growth opportunities.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company purchased $212 million of its common shares under this repurchase authorization.  The timing and number of shares repurchased under the program was determined by management at its discretion, and depended on a number of factors, including compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, results of our internal shareholder valuation model, general market and business conditions and applicable legal requirements.  All purchases under this share repurchase program were funded through existing cash balances, operating cash flows, and borrowings under our $200 million term loan.  We do not expect this repurchase program to negatively impact our ability to fund future development projects such as building new stores. 
    
  Debt 
   Our long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 are as set forth below: 

Senior Notes 
    
  On August 14, 2013, Murphy Oil USA, Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, issued   6.00%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the  Senior Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of   $500 million  . The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Murphy USA, and are guaranteed by certain 100% owned subsidiaries that guarantee our credit facilities. The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the restricted subsidiaries to incur  
  
   36 

additional indebtedness or liens, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments or investments, enter into transactions with affiliates or merge with or into other entities. 
    
  The Senior Notes and the guarantees rank equally with all of our and the guarantors  existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively junior to our and the guarantors  existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness with respect to the credit facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.  The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future third-party liabilities, including trade payables, of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  In March 2016, we amended and extended our existing credit agreement. The credit agreement provides for a committed     $450 million   asset-based loan (ABL) facility (with availability subject to the borrowing base described below) and a     $200 million   term loan facility.   It also provides for a   $150 million      uncommitted  incremental  facility.   On March 10, 2016,     Murphy Oil USA, Inc. borrowed     $200 million   under the term loan facility that has a   four  -year term.    
    
  The borrowing base is, at any time of determination, the amount (net of reserves) equal to the sum of: 
    
           100%   of eligible cash at such time, plus 
           90%   of eligible credit card receivables at such time, plus 
           90%   of eligible investment grade accounts, plus 
           85%   of eligible other accounts, plus 
           80%   of eligible product supply/wholesale refined products inventory at such time, plus 
           75%   of eligible retail refined products inventory at such time, plus 
    
  the lesser of (i)   70%   of the average cost of eligible retail merchandise inventory at such time and (ii)   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible retail merchandise inventory at such time. 
    
  The ABL facility includes a   $200 million   sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Letters of credit issued under the ABL facility reduce availability under the ABL facility. 
     
  Interest payable on the credit facilities is based on either: 

the London interbank offered rate, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (the  Adjusted LIBO Rate  or 
                
    the Alternate Base Rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus   0.50%   per annum and (c) the one-month Adjusted LIBO Rate plus   1.00%   per annum, 
       
  plus, (A) in the case of Adjusted LIBO Rate borrowings, (i) with respect to the ABL facility, spreads ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio under the ABL facility or (ii) with respect to the term loan facility, spreads ranging from   2.50%   to   2.75%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio and (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate borrowings, (i) with respect to the ABL facility, spreads ranging from   0.50%   to   1.00%   per annum depending on total debt to EBITDA ratio or (ii) with respect to the term loan facility, spreads ranging from   1.50%   to   1.75%   per annum depending on a total debt to EBITDA ratio. 
    
  The interest rate period with respect to the Adjusted LIBO Rate interest rate option can be set at   one  ,   two  ,   three  , or   six   months as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. 
    
  We were obligated to make quarterly amortization payments on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility beginning on July 1, 2016 equal to   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of term loans made on March 10, 2016, with the remaining balance payable on the scheduled maturity date of the term loan facility.  Borrowings under the credit facilities are prepayable at our option without premium or penalty. We are also required to prepay the term loan facility with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or casualty events, subject to certain exceptions. The credit agreement also includes certain customary mandatory prepayment provisions with respect to the ABL facility. 
    
  The credit agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to make certain investments, to enter into sale-leaseback transactions, to  
  
   37 

make certain restricted payments, to enter into consolidations, mergers or sales of material assets and other fundamental changes, to transact with affiliates, to enter into agreements restricting the ability of subsidiaries to incur liens or pay dividends, or to make certain accounting changes. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of a minimum of   1.0   to 1.0 when availability for at least   three   consecutive business days is less than the greater of (a)   17.5%   of the lesser of the aggregate ABL facility commitments and the borrowing base and (b)   $70,000,000   (including as of the most recent fiscal quarter end on the first date when availability is less than such amount), as well as a maximum secured total debt to EBITDA ratio of   4.5   to 1.0 at any time when the term loans are outstanding.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our fixed charge coverage ratio was   0.64  ; however, we had   no   debt outstanding under the ABL facility at that date so the fixed charge coverage ratio currently has no impact on our operations or liquidity.          
    
  After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on certain payments, which could include dividends, under the credit agreement (which restrictions are only applicable when availability under the credit agreement does not exceed the greater of   25%   of the lesser of the revolving commitments and the borrowing base and   $100 million   (and if availability under the credit agreement does not exceed the greater of   40%   of the lesser of the revolving commitments and the borrowing base and   $100 million  , then our fixed charge coverage ratio must be at least   1.0   to 1.0)) and the indenture, and subject to compliance with applicable law.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a shortfall of approximately   $245.7 million   of its net income and retained earnings subject to such restrictions before the fixed charge coverage ratio would exceed   1.0   to 1.0. 
    
  All obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Murphy USA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and all obligations under the credit agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain assets of Murphy USA, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and the guarantors party thereto. 
    
  Capital Spending 
    
  Capital spending and investments in our Marketing segment relate primarily to the acquisition of land and the construction of new Company stations. Our Marketing capital is also deployed to improve our existing sites, which we refer to as sustaining capital.  We also use sustaining capital in this business as needed to ensure reliability and continued performance of our sites.  We also invest in our Corporate and other assets segment.  The following table outlines our capital spending and investments by segment for the   three and nine     month periods ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

We currently expect capital expenditures for the full year   2016     to range from approximately $250     million     to $300     million, including $175     million to $225     million     for the retail marketing business,  $5     million for product supply and wholesale operations and $30 million for Corporate and other assets including our ASaP program initiatives and a remodel of our Corporate headquarters.  Also included in this total is approximately $40 million of maintenance capital for a continuation of our refresh program at 300 sites, along with increasing our supercooler installations to 180 locations this year.  See Note 18  Commitments  in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended     December 31, 2015     included in our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains       forward-looking statements      within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements express management s current views concerning future events or results, including without limitation our anticipated growth strategy, particularly with respect to our Walmart relationship and plans to build additional sites, and     our ability to generate revenues, including     the sale of RINs,     which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause one or more of these forecasted events not to occur include, but are not limited to, a deterioration in the business or prospects of the U.S.     retail     marketing business, adverse developments in the U.S.     retail     marketing business s markets or adverse developments in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets or economies generally,     the volatility and level of crude oil, corn and other commodity prices, the volatility and level of gasoline prices, customer demand for our products, disruptions in our relationship with Walmart,     political and regulatory developments that may be adverse to us, and uncontrollable natural hazards or any of the other factors set forth under the caption  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report     and in our     Form 10-K.     As a result you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  If any of the forecasted events does not occur for any reason, our business, results of operation, cash flows and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil and refined products (primarily gasoline and diesel) used in our operations. These fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. We make limited use of derivative instruments to manage certain risks related to commodity prices. The use of derivative instruments for risk management is covered by operating policies and is closely monitored by our middle-office function and the Company s senior management. 
  As described in Note     8      Financial Instruments and Risk Management  in the accompanying unaudited     consolidated     financial statements, there were short-term commodity derivative contracts in place at     September 30, 2016     to hedge the purchase price of refined products.  A 10% increase or decrease in the respective benchmark price of the commodities underlying these derivative contracts would have     been immaterial to the Company.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the changes in the value for an equivalent volume of these products.  
  For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note     14  Financial Instruments and Risk Management  in     our     audited combined financial statements for the three     year period ended     December 31, 2015 included in the Form 10-K and Note     8  Financial Instruments and Risk Management  in the accompanying unaudited     consolidated     financial statements for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
   
  ITEM 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
  Our management has evaluated, with the participation of     our principal executive     and financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of     September 30, 2016  . 
  Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II       OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was engaged in a number of legal proceedings, all of which the Company considers routine and incidental to its business.  See Note 12   Contingencies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Based on information currently available to the Company, the ultimate resolution of environmental and legal matters referred to in this Item is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. 

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS 
    
  Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition involve various risks and uncertainties.
