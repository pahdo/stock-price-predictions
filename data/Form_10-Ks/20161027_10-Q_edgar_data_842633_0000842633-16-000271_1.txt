1. Basis of Presentation  
  TriMas Corporation ("TriMas" or the "Company"), and its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and distributor of products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets.  The Company is principally engaged in the following reportable segments with diverse products and market channels:  Packaging, Aerospace, Energy and Engineered Components.  See Note   10  , "  Segment Information  ," for further information on each of the Company's reportable segments. 
  On June 30, 2015, the Company completed the spin-off of its Cequent businesses, creating a new independent publicly traded company, Horizon Global Corporation ("Horizon").  In addition, on June 30, 2015, immediately prior to the effective time of the spin-off, Horizon paid a cash distribution to the Company of   $214.5 million   using the proceeds of its new debt financing arrangement and cash on hand.  The Company incurred approximately   $30 million   of one-time, pre-tax costs associated with the spin-off, of which approximately   $29 million   was incurred during 2015. These costs primarily related to financing, legal, tax and accounting services rendered by third parties. Of the   $30 million   in costs, approximately   $18 million   was included in the loss from discontinued operations,   $9 million   was capitalized as deferred financing fees associated with Horizon's debt issuance coincident with the spin-off and was included in the balance sheet of the discontinued operations and approximately   $3 million   relates to fees associated with the Company's refinancing of long-term debt, of which approximately   $2 million   was included in the income from continuing operations as debt financing and extinguishment costs and approximately   $1 million   was capitalized as deferred financing fees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
  The results of operations and cash flows of the Cequent businesses are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of the spin-off.  See Note   3  , "  Discontinued Operations  ," for further details regarding the spin-off.  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and, in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments, including adjustments of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations.  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.   
   
  2  . New Accounting Pronouncements  
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied using a retrospective approach with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)" ("ASU 2016-09").  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02").  ASU 2016-02 requires that lessees, at the lease commencement date, recognize a lease liability representing the lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease as well as a right-of-use asset, which represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of a specified asset, for the lease term. The new guidance also aligns lessor accounting to the lessee accounting model and to Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" ("ASU 2015-11").  ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Since the issuance of the original standard, the FASB has issued several subsequent updates including the following: 1) the deferral of ASU 2014-09 by one year, making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 while also providing for early adoption, but not before the original effective date (ASU 2015-14); 2) clarification of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations (ASU 2016-08); 3) further guidance on identifying performance obligations in a contract as well as clarifications on the licensing implementation guidance (ASU 2016-10); 4) rescission of several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance related to accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, freight services and consideration given by a vendor to a customer (ASU 2016-11); and 5) additional guidance and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues (ASU 2016-12). The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of these ASUs on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  3  .  Discontinued Operations  
  On June 30, 2015, the Company completed the spin-off of its Cequent businesses (comprised of the former Cequent Americas and Cequent Asia Pacific Europe Africa ("Cequent APEA") reportable segments), creating a new independent publicly traded company, Horizon, through the distribution of 100% of the Company's interest in Horizon to holders of the Company's common stock. On June 30, 2015, each of the Company's shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of June 25, 2015 received   two   shares of Horizon common stock for every   five   shares of TriMas common stock held.  In addition, on June 30, 2015, immediately prior to the effective time of the spin-off, Horizon entered into a new debt financing arrangement and used the proceeds to make a cash distribution of approximately   $214.5 million   to the Company.  
  Following the spin-off, there were no assets or liabilities remaining from the Cequent operations. The Cequent businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statement of income and cash flows for all periods presented. 
  Results of discontinued operations are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

Credit Agreement 
  The Company is party to a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), consisting of a   $500.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility, which permits borrowings denominated in specific foreign currencies ("Foreign Currency Loans"), subject to a   $75.0 million   sub limit, which matures on   June 30, 2020   and is subject to interest at London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR") plus 1.75%, and a   $275.0 million   senior secured term loan A facility ("Term Loan A Facility"), which matures on   June 30, 2020   and is subject to interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. The interest rate spread is based upon the leverage ratio, as defined, as of the most recent determination date. 
  The Credit Agreement also provides   incremental term loan and/or revolving credit facility commitments in an amount not to exceed the greater of   $300.0 million   and an amount such that, after giving effect to such incremental commitments and the incurrence of any other indebtedness substantially simultaneously with the making of such commitments, the senior secured net leverage ratio, as defined, is no greater than   2.50   to 1.00. The terms and conditions of any incremental term loan and/or revolving credit facility commitments must be no more favorable than the existing credit facility.

The Company may be required to prepay a portion of its Term Loan A Facility in an amount equal to a percentage of the Company's excess cash flow, as defined, with such percentage based on the Company's leverage ratio, as defined. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amounts are due under this provision. 
  The Company is also able to issue letters of credit, not to exceed   $40.0 million   in aggregate, against its revolving credit facility commitments.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had letters of credit of approximately   $16.3 million   and   $21.6 million  , respectively, issued and outstanding.      
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $97.2 million   outstanding under its revolving credit facility and had approximately   $386.5 million   potentially available after giving effect to approximately   $16.3 million   of letters of credit issued and outstanding.  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $100.3 million   outstanding under its revolving credit facility and had approximately   $378.1 million   potentially available after giving effect to approximately   $21.6 million   of letters of credit issued and outstanding.  However, including availability under its accounts receivable facility and after consideration of leverage restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company had approximately   $78.3 million   and   $107.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of borrowing capacity available for general corporate purposes.  
  Principal payments required under the Credit Agreement for the Term Loan A Facility are approximately   $3.4 million   due each fiscal quarter from December 2015 through September 2018 and approximately   $5.2 million   due each fiscal quarter from December 2018 through March 2020, with final payment of approximately   $202.8 million   due on June 30, 2020. 
  The debt under the Credit Agreement is an obligation of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of such parties.  Borrowings under the   $75.0 million   foreign currency sub limit of the   $500.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility are secured by a pledge of the assets of the foreign subsidiary borrowers that are a party to the agreement.  The Credit Agreement also contains various negative and affirmative covenants and other requirements affecting the Company and its subsidiaries, including restrictions on the incurrence of debt, liens, mergers, investments, loans, advances, guarantee obligations, acquisitions, assets dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging agreements, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, restrictive agreements and amendments to charters, bylaws, and other material documents. The terms of the Credit Agreement also require the Company and its subsidiaries to meet certain restrictive financial covenants and ratios computed quarterly, including a maximum leverage ratio (total consolidated indebtedness plus outstanding amounts under the accounts receivable securitization facility over consolidated EBITDA, as defined) and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA, as defined, over cash interest expense, as defined).  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.  
  In June 2015, the Company amended its Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Company was able to extend maturities and resize its credit facilities following the spin-off of the Cequent businesses. In connection with entering into the amended Credit Agreement, the Company incurred approximately   $1.8 million   in fees to complete the Credit Agreement, of which approximately   $1.4 million   was capitalized as deferred financing fees as of June 30, 2015 and   $0.4 million   was recorded as debt financing fees in the accompanying consolidated statement of income during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The Company also recorded non-cash debt extinguishment costs of   $1.5 million   related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the previous term loan during the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's Term Loan A Facility traded at approximately   99.6%   of par value and the Company's revolving credit facility traded at approximately   99.3%   of par value. The valuations of the Credit Agreement were determined based on Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, as defined.

Receivables Facility 
  The Company is party to an accounts receivable facility through TSPC, Inc. ("TSPC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to sell trade accounts receivable of substantially all of the Company's domestic business operations. Under this facility, TSPC, from time to time, may sell an undivided fractional ownership interest in the pool of receivables up to   $75.0 million   to a third-party multi-seller receivables funding company.  The net amount financed under the facility is less than the face amount of accounts receivable by an amount that approximates the purchaser's financing costs.  The cost of funds under this facility consisted of a 1-month LIBOR-based rate plus a usage fee of   1.00%   and a fee on the unused portion of the facility of   0.35%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company had approximately   $48.8 million   and   $53.6 million   outstanding under the facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and approximately   $8.6 million   and   $7.1 million   available but not utilized as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Aggregate costs incurred under the facility were approximately   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.  The facility expires on   June 30, 2020  . 
  The cost of funds fees incurred are determined by calculating the estimated present value of the receivables sold compared to their carrying amount.  The estimated present value factor is based on historical collection experience and a discount rate based on a 1-month LIBOR-based rate plus the usage fee discussed above and is computed in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cost of funds under the facility was based on an average liquidation period of the portfolio of approximately 1.7 months and an average discount rate of   1.9%  .   
   
  8  . Derivative Instruments   
  The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to fix the LIBOR-based variable portion of the interest rate on its long-term debt. Terms of the interest rate swap agreements require the Company to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedge a declining notional value of debt ranging from approximately   $248.2 million   to approximately   $192.7 million  , amortizing consistent with future scheduled debt principal payments. The interest rate swap agreements establish fixed interest rates in a range of   0.74%   to   2.68%   with various expiration terms extending to June 30, 2020. At inception, the interest rate swaps were and continue to be designated as cash flow hedges. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value carrying amount of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded as follows (dollars in thousands):

9  . Commitments and Contingencies  
  Asbestos 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was a party to   800   pending cases involving an aggregate of   5,714   claimants alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing materials formerly used in gaskets (both encapsulated and otherwise) manufactured or distributed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries for use primarily in the petrochemical refining and exploration industries.  The following chart summarizes the number of claimants, number of claims filed, number of claims dismissed, number of claims settled, the average settlement amount per claim and the total defense costs, exclusive of amounts reimbursed under the Company's primary insurance, at the applicable date and for the applicable periods: 

In addition, the Company acquired various companies to distribute its products that had distributed gaskets of other manufacturers prior to acquisition. The Company believes that many of its pending cases relate to locations at which none of its gaskets were distributed or used.   
  The Company may be subjected to significant additional asbestos-related claims in the future, the cost of settling cases in which product identification can be made may increase, and the Company may be subjected to further claims in respect of the former activities of its acquired gasket distributors. The Company is unable to make a meaningful statement concerning the monetary claims made in the asbestos cases given that, among other things, claims may be initially made in some jurisdictions without specifying the amount sought or by simply stating the requisite or maximum permissible monetary relief, and may be amended to alter the amount sought.  The large majority of claims do not specify the amount sought.  Of the   5,714   claims pending at   September 30, 2016  ,   96   set forth specific amounts of damages (other than those stating the statutory minimum or maximum). At   September 30, 2016  , of the   96   claims that set forth specific amounts, there were no claims seeking specific amounts for punitive damages. Below is a breakdown of the amount sought for those claims seeking specific amounts: 

In addition, relatively few of the claims have reached the discovery stage and even fewer claims have gone past the discovery stage.  
  Total settlement costs (exclusive of defense costs) for all asbestos-related cases, some of which were filed over 20 years ago, have been approximately   $8.2 million  .  All relief sought in the asbestos cases is monetary in nature.  To date, approximately   40%   of the Company's costs related to settlement and defense of asbestos litigation have been covered by its primary insurance.  Effective February 14, 2006, the Company entered into a coverage-in-place agreement with its first level excess carriers regarding the coverage to be provided to the Company for asbestos-related claims when the primary insurance is exhausted.  The coverage-in-place agreement makes asbestos defense costs and indemnity coverage available to the Company that might otherwise be disputed by the carriers and provides a methodology for the administration of such expenses.  Nonetheless, the Company believes it is likely there will be a period within the next   6   to   18   months, prior to the commencement of coverage under this agreement and following exhaustion of the Company's primary insurance coverage, during which the Company will be solely responsible for defense costs and indemnity payments, the duration of which would be subject to the scope of damage awards and settlements paid.

Based on the settlements made to date and the number of claims dismissed or withdrawn for lack of product identification, the Company believes that the relief sought (when specified) does not bear a reasonable relationship to its potential liability.  Based upon the Company's experience to date, including the trend in annual defense and settlement costs incurred to date, and other available information (including the availability of excess insurance), the Company does not believe these cases will have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations or cash flows. 
  Claims and Litigation 
  The Company is subject to other claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business which the Company does not believe are material. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company resolved a matter related to a claim made against the Company by a competitor alleging false advertising for approximately   $2.8 million  , inclusive of attorney fees and expenses.  
  The Company does not believe claims and litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations or cash flows.

11  . Equity Awards  
  The Company maintains the following long-term equity incentive plans: the TriMas Corporation Director Retainer Share Election Program, the 2011 TriMas Corporation Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, the TriMas Corporation 2006 Long Term Equity Incentive Plan and the TriMas Corporation 2002 Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Plans").  The 2002 Long Term Equity Incentive Plan expired in 2012, such that, while existing grants will remain outstanding until exercised, vested or cancelled, no new shares may be issued under the plan.  See below for details of awards under the Plans by type.  
  Stock Options 
  The Company granted   150,000   stock option awards during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company estimated the grant-date fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of   1.1%  , expected volatility of   32.3%   and an expected term of   6   years. Information related to stock options at   September 30, 2016   is as follows:  

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $1.0 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of   2.8   years. 
  The Company recognized approximately   $0.1 million   of stock-based compensation related to stock options during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   no   stock-based compensation during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.  
  Restricted Shares 
  The Company awarded the following restricted shares during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    granted   2,800   restricted shares of common stock to certain employees that are subject only to a service condition and vest on the first anniversary date of the award so long as the employee remains with the Company; 
                
    granted   235,251   restricted shares of common stock to certain employees which are subject only to a service condition and vest ratably over   three years   so long as the employee remains with the Company; 
                
    granted   42,740   restr  icted shares of co  mmon stock to certain employees which are subject only to a service condition and vest on the first anniversary date of the award. The awards were made to participants in the Company's short-term incentive compensation plan ("STI"), where all STI participants whose target annual award exceeds   $20 thousand   receive   80%   of the value in earned cash and   20%   in the form of a restricted stock award upon finalization of the award amount in the first quarter e  ach year following the previous plan year; and 
                
    granted   41,174     restricted shares of common stock to its non-employee independent directors, which   vest   one year   from date of grant so long as the director and/or Company does not terminate their service prior to the vesting date.

In addition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   12,525   shares related to director fee deferrals. The Company allows for its non-employee independent directors to make an annual election to defer all or a portion of their directors fees and to receive the deferred amount in cash or equity. Certain of the Company's directors have elected to defer all or a portion of their directors fees and to receive the amount in Company common stock at a future date.   
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company awarded   198,956   performance-based shares of common stock to certain Company key employees which vest three years from the grant date so long as the employee remains with the Company. The performance criteria for these awards is based on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the TSR of the common stock of a pre-defined industry peer-group, measured over a period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2018.  TSR is calculated as the Company's average closing stock price for the 20-trading days at the end of the performance period plus Company dividends, divided by the Company's average closing stock price for the 20-trading days prior to the start of the performance period.  Depending on the performance achieved, the amount of shares earned can vary from   0%   of the target award to a maximum of   200%   of the target award.  The Company estimated the grant-date fair value and term of the awards subject to a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of   0.96%   and annualized volatility of   35.8%  . 
  During 2013, the Company awarded performance-based shares of common stock to certain Company key employees which were earned based upon the achievement of earnings per share compound annual growth rate and cash generation performance metrics over a period of three calendar years, beginning January 1, 2013 and ending on December 31, 2015.  The Company attained   50%   of the target on a weighted average basis, resulting in a reduction of   35,850   shares during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Information related to restricted shares at   September 30, 2016   is as follows:  

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.3 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted shares that is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of   1.9   years.  
  The Company recognized approximately   $1.0 million   and   $1.7 million   of stock-based compensation expense related to restricted shares during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $5.1 million   and   $4.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

Item 2  .    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition contains forward-looking statements regarding industry outlook and our expectations regarding the performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements," at the beginning of this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion together with the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  Introduction 
  We are a global manufacturer and distributor of products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets. We are principally engaged in four reportable segments: Packaging, Aerospace, Energy and Engineered Components.  
  On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our Cequent businesses, creating a new independent publicly-traded company, Horizon Global Corporation ("Horizon"). On June 30, 2015, our stockholders received two shares of Horizon common stock for every five shares of TriMas common stock that they held as of the close of business on June 25, 2015. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Horizon are included as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of the spin-off.  
  Key Factors and Risks Affecting Our Reported Results.    Our businesses and results of operations depend upon general economic conditions and we serve some customers in cyclical industries that are highly competitive and are themselves significantly impacted by changes in economic conditions. There has been low overall economic growth, particularly in the United States, and global economic conditions appear to have been relatively stable over the past couple of years.  The most significant external factor impacting us recently is the impact of lower oil prices, which began to decline in the fourth quarter of 2014, declined throughout 2015 and remained at low levels during the first nine months of 2016.  This decline directly impacts our Arrow Engine business within our Engineered Components reportable segment (which serves the upstream oil and natural gas markets at the well site) and our Energy reportable segment, which primarily serves petrochemical and other refineries in the downstream oil and gas markets, as well as having a smaller portion of the business dedicated to upstream activity.   
  Our Arrow Engine business' revenue declined more than 50% during 2015 as compared to 2014, and again in the first nine months of 2016 compared with first nine months of 2015, and is expected to remain at a low level until the price of oil increases over a sustained period where its customers decide to increase their activity levels and related well-site investments.  The Arrow Engine business reacted aggressively in cutting costs and structuring its business in response to the lower demand levels, and was able to remain at an approximately break-even profit level in 2015, and near break-even the first nine months of 2016 despite these significant reductions in revenue. 
  In our Energy business, the impact of the lower oil prices was muted in 2015 due to market share gains and adding product content to our product portfolio.  We were able to essentially hold 2015 sales levels flat with 2014 until the fourth quarter, when capital spending was significantly reduced at many of our customers, and sales levels dropped more than 20% on a sequential basis.    The sales level has remained at a lower level during the first nine months of 2016, as customers tightly manage spending initiatives. 
  In addition to the impact of lower oil prices, there has been a shift over the past two to three years in our Energy reportable segment from historical demand and activity, both in the United States and internationally.  Petrochemical plants and refinery customers deferred shutdown activity, and we experienced decreases in engineering and construction ("E C") customer activity.  As noted above, we were able to hold sales levels essentially flat on a sequential quarterly basis in 2014 and until fourth quarter of 2015 with market share gains and additional product content; however, our margins declined significantly due to the mix of product sales and inefficiencies that resulted from the shift in activity levels.  The current lower oil prices have continued to place further pressure on the top-line and predictability of customer order patterns.  Given these factors, we have been restructuring the business and its fixed cost structure to better align with the current business environment.  We closed as well as consolidated certain facilities during 2014 and 2015, and opened a new lower-cost facility in Mexico, which began production in the fourth quarter of 2015.  We have begun, and expect to continue, to realize the cost savings and operational efficiencies associated with leveraging the new lower fixed cost structure and other initiatives.

     Table of Contents  

In addition to the impact of lower oil prices, the other significant external factor impacting our recent results is supply chain disruption within our Aerospace reportable segment.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, our two largest Aerospace distribution customers began reducing their investment in on-hand inventory levels of fastener products, which we believe was partially in response to the decision of airframe original equipment ("OE") customers to source more product directly from the manufacturer.  This trend has continued through the third quarter of 2016.  While this has impacted our net sales, it has also had a significant impact on margin levels, as certain of these products historically command higher profit margins.  In addition to the reduction in distribution customer sales, we also have experienced production and scheduling challenges in one of our Aerospace fastener facilities that has contributed to significantly lower margins in the first nine months of 2016 versus prior quarters and years.  We established plans to address these matters and have been executing against those plans, as evidenced by our improved margins on a sequential quarterly basis during the second and third quarters of 2016.  We will continue to monitor our operating results related to these matters and to determine if a trend develops that is other than temporary, in which case we may need to assess the potential for impairment of this reporting unit's long-lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, given the uncertain economic environment and the impact on net sales and profitability of lower oil prices, a stronger U.S. dollar and slowing industrial production, we announced a Financial Improvement Plan ("FIP") to improve our profitability, cash flow conversion and operational efficiency. As part of the FIP, we targeted cost actions to yield $15 million of annual savings, accelerating an additional $5 million of savings initiatives in the Energy business, with the remaining $10 million of savings expected to be spread relatively evenly across the remainder of the Company. In February 2016, we added $7 million of cost savings actions, increasing the expected annual run-rate cost savings to $22 million.  By implementing the FIP, we believe we have lowered the cost structure of our engine-related business, allowing it to achieve break-even operating profit despite the more than 50% decline in sales as a result of the impact of lower oil prices.  The FIP consisted of headcount reductions, manufacturing and administrative cost reduction and facility closures or consolidations. We believe the FIP was necessary to help mitigate the external factors pressuring our revenue, and position the Company for improved profitability and operating leverage across a lower fixed cost structure in the future. The FIP is substantially complete, and the resulting savings is significantly helping to mitigate the impact of the reduction in year-over-year sales levels.   
  During the third quarter of 2016, given continued year-over-year net sales reductions, we accelerated additional facility consolidation actions in each of our reportable segments to more efficiently utilize our existing locations while better serving our customers.  While each of the consolidation actions is not individually significant to the results of operations, they were enacted as part of our continuous improvement initiatives to optimize our manufacturing footprint and adapt to changing markets while remaining responsive to our customers.  We continue to evaluate further actions as merited based on business performance, considering additional cost reductions or facility closures should sales and profitability levels continue below historical levels.   
  Critical factors affecting our ability to succeed include: our ability to create organic growth through product development, cross selling and extending product-line offerings, and our ability to quickly and cost-effectively introduce new products; our ability to acquire and integrate companies or products that supplement existing product lines, add new distribution channels, expand our geographic coverage or enable better absorption of overhead costs; our ability to manage our cost structure more efficiently via supply base management, internal sourcing and/or purchasing of materials, selective outsourcing and/or purchasing of support functions, working capital management, and greater leverage of our administrative functions. If we are unable to do any of the foregoing successfully, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. 
  Our businesses do not experience significant seasonal fluctuation, other than our fourth quarter has tended to be the lowest net sales quarter of the year given holiday shutdowns in certain customers or other customers deferring capital spending to the new year. We do not consider sales order backlog to be a material factor in our business. A growing portion of our sales is derived from international sources, which exposes us to certain risks, including currency risks. 
  We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, aluminum, polyethylene and other resins and utility-related inputs. Historically, we have experienced volatility in costs of steel and resin and have worked with our suppliers to manage costs and disruptions in supply. We also utilize pricing programs to pass increased steel, aluminum and resin costs to customers. Although we may experience delays in our ability to implement price increases, we have been generally able to recover such increased costs.  We may experience disruptions in supply in the future and may not be able to pass along higher costs associated with such disruptions to our customers in the form of price increases.

Certain of our businesses are sensitive to oil price movements.  As noted earlier, our Arrow Engine business is most directly impacted by significant volatility in oil prices.  Arrow's pumpjack and other engine sales and related parts, which comprise a significant portion of the business, are impacted by oil drilling levels, rig counts and commodity pricing.  In addition, a portion of our Energy reportable segment serves upstream customers at oil well sites that have been impacted by changes in oil prices.  The majority of this segment provides parts for refineries and chemical plants, which may or may not decide to incur capital expenditures or changeover production stock, both of which require retooling with our gaskets and bolts, in times of fluctuating oil prices.  Our Packaging reportable segment may be impacted by oil prices, as it is a significant driver of resin pricing, although we generally are able to maintain profit levels when oil prices change due to escalator/de-escalator clauses in contracts with many of our customers.

    costs incurred and savings achieved from our FIP and other cost savings actions, spread across all of our reportable segments, with the largest amounts within our Energy reportable segment; 
                
    the impact of production and scheduling costs and inefficiencies, as well as the impact of lower distribution customer sales, all within our Aerospace reportable segment; 
                
    the impact of our November 2015 acquisition of the Tolleson, Arizona machined components facility from Parker-Hannifin within our Aerospace reportable segment; and 
                
    the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, primarily in our Packaging and Energy reportable segments. 

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared with Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015     
  Overall, net sales   decreased   approximately $19.9 million, or   9.0%  , to   $202.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $222.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by our Energy and Engineered Components reportable segments, for which combined sales decreased by approximately $24.2 million (excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange), primarily as a result of lower oil prices and weakness in the energy-facing and industrial end markets.  Our sales also decreased by approximately $2.5 million due to net unfavorable currency exchange, primarily in our Packaging reportable segment, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange, sales within our Packaging reportable segment increased by approximately $4.7 million. Sales within our Aerospace reportable segment increased approximately $2.0 million, as the approximate $3.1 million increase resulting from the machined components facility acquisition in November 2015 was partially offset by lower sales to our distribution customers.  
  Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of sales) approximated   28.7%   and   28.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Gross profit margin increased primarily due to lower restructuring-related costs as compared to the prior year, primarily within our Energy reportable segment, and overall costs savings as a result of execution of our FIP and other cost savings actions. The impact of these savings more than offset the margin impact of lower net sales levels and related lower fixed cost absorption.  In addition, gross profit decreased approximately $1.2 million as a result of the year-over-year impact of our reduction of an estimated acquisition liability in our Packaging segment in the third quarter of 2015, which did not recur in the current year.  Gross profit also decreased over the prior year by approximately $1.0 million as a result of unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.  
  Operating profit margin (operating profit as a percentage of sales) approximated   8.8%   and   9.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Operating profit   decreased   approximately $3.8 million, or   17.5%  , to   $17.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $21.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower sales levels in our Energy and Engineered Components reportable segments and costs related to the change in our President and Chief Executive Officer. These declines were mostly offset by savings as a result of our FIP, other cost savings initiatives and continued productivity initiatives.  
  Interest expense increased approximately $0.1 million, to   $3.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our weighted-average variable rate borrowings decreased to approximately $446.3 million in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from approximately $519.5 million in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding variable rate borrowings, including our credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") and accounts receivable facilities, increased to approximately 2.1% for three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from approximately 1.8% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Other expense, net decreased approximately $0.5 million, to   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $0.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to reductions of certain indemnification assets related to uncertain tax liabilities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in gains on transactions denominated in foreign currencies.

The effective income tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   37.8%   and   32.7%  , respectively. The increase in the rate was primarily a result of losses at certain foreign subsidiaries where no tax benefit could be recorded in the third quarter of 2016, and the year-over-year impact of recognizing certain tax benefits resulting from the reduction of certain tax positions due to a lapse of statutory limitations in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by earnings in foreign jurisdictions where the effective tax rate was less than 35%. 
  Net income from continuing operations   decreased   by approximately   $2.9 million  , to   $8.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a $3.8 million decrease in operating profit, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in other expense, net and a $0.4 million decrease in income tax expense. 
  See below for a discussion of operating results by segment.  
   
  Packaging.    Net sales   increased   approximately   $2.4 million  , or   2.7%  , to   $90.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $87.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Sales increased in our health, beauty and home care end markets by approximately $3.9 million, primarily due to growth in all regions.  Sales of our industrial closures increased by approximately $0.7 million due to higher demand in North America.  These increases were partially offset by approximately $2.3 million of unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
  Packaging's gross profit   increased   approximately   $0.2 million   to   $32.2 million  , or   35.6%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $32.0 million  , or   36.4%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Gross profit increased approximately $1.7 million due to higher sales levels, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, and by approximately $0.7 million due to a combination of improved overhead cost absorption and a more favorable product sales mix. These increases were partially offset by the year-over-year impact of our reduction of an estimated acquisition liability in the third quarter of 2015 by approximately $1.2 million, which did not recur in 2016, and approximately $1.0 million due to unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
  Packaging's selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   approximately   $2.0 million   to   $12.1 million  , or   13.4%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $10.1 million  , or   11.5%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to approximately $1.1 million of severance and other costs related to the closure of our existing Mexico manufacturing facility and establishment and move to the new manufacturing facility in Mexico, which is planned to begin production during the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, there was an approximate $1.1 million reduction in the Arminak   Associates ( Arminak ) contingent liability in the three months ended September 30, 2015. These increases, along with approximately $0.6 million higher professional fee expenses year-over-year, were partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.6 million due to the impact of foreign currency, and lower employee related costs as a result of execution of the FIP. 
  Packaging's operating profit   decreased   approximately   $1.8 million   to   $20.1 million  , or   22.2%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $21.9 million  , or   24.9%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Although sales levels increased, operating profit and related margin declined as a result of the reduction in previously estimated acquisition-related liabilities, which did not recur in the current year, costs related to the closure of our current facility in Mexico and move to a new facility and an increase in professional fees.  In addition, operating profit decreased approximately $0.4 million due to unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
   
  Aerospace.      Net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased   approximately $2.0 million, or   4.5%  , to   $47.4 million  , as compared to   $45.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Sales increased approximately $3.1 million as a result of the machined components facility acquisition from Parker Hannifin in November 2015.  Sales to OE customers increased approximately $0.7 million, while sales to distribution customers declined by approximately $1.8 million, primarily as a result of large customers continuing planned reductions of their investment in on-hand inventory levels of certain fastener products.  Although Aerospace continued to improve its scheduling and throughput levels during the third quarter of 2016 on a sequential basis as compared with the first and second quarters of 2016, order demand from OE customers would have supported higher sales levels in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Gross profit within Aerospace   decreased   approximately $2.1 million to   $13.1 million  , or   27.6%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $15.2 million  , or   33.5%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Gross profit decreased by approximately $0.9 million due to manufacturing inefficiencies and related lower fixed cost absorption, approximately $0.8 million as a result of a less favorable product sales mix and approximately $0.4 million due to lower organic sales levels.

Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   approximately $1.7 million to   $6.4 million  , or   13.5%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $8.1 million  , or   17.9%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to charges related to operational and leadership changes incurred in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   that did not repeat in 2016 as well as cost savings associated with the FIP. 
  Operating profit within Aerospace   decreased   approximately $0.4 million to   $6.7 million  , or   14.0%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $7.1 million  , or   15.7%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decline in operating profit and operating profit margin was attributable to manufacturing inefficiencies, lower fixed cost absorption, lower organic sales levels and less favorable product sales mix, which were partially offset by cost savings achieved as part of the FIP and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. 
   
  Energy.      Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $13.4 million  , or   25.9%  , to   $38.2 million  , as compared to   $51.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Sales decreased by approximately $11.8 million in the United States, primarily due to lower downstream demand from petrochemical refinery and distribution customers, as well as lower E C activity.  Net sales also declined by approximately $1.4 million in our international branches, due both to weaker upstream and downstream demand.  Additionally, sales decreased by approximately $0.2 million due to net unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
  Gross profit within Energy   decreased   approximately   $0.3 million   to   $7.7 million  , or   20.1%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $8.0 million  , or   15.5%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Gross profit decreased by approximately $2.1 million as a result of lower sales levels. The decrease in gross profit related to sales levels was partially offset by approximately $1.5 million lower restructuring-related costs as compared to the prior year, and lower labor and fixed costs as a result of the cost savings actions as part of the FIP. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses within Energy   decreased   approximately   $2.0 million   to   $9.5 million  , or   25.0%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $11.6 million  , or   22.4%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of cost savings as a result of the FIP.  In addition, Energy incurred approximately $0.7 million lower restructuring-related costs in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Overall, operating loss within Energy decreased approximately   $1.7 million   to an approximate   $1.9 million   loss, or   4.9%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a loss of   $3.6 million  , or   6.9%   of sales, in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The operating loss decreased as a result of lower costs in connection with the execution of the restructuring and related FIP and lower restructuring-related costs during the third quarter of 2016.  
   
  Engineered Components.      Net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $11.0 million  , or   29.5%  , to   $26.3 million  , as compared to   $37.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Sales of our industrial cylinders decreased by approximately $6.1 million, primarily due to lower demand for large high pressure gas cylinders in industrial applications. Sales of our engines and compression-related products declined approximately $4.9 million as a result of reduced levels of oil and gas drilling and well completions in the U.S. and Canada in response to lower oil prices. 
  Gross profit within Engineered Components   decreased   approximately   $2.2 million   to   $5.1 million  , or   19.5%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $7.3 million  , or   19.5%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the lower sales levels. Gross profit margin remained consistent with the prior year level, as savings resulting from the FIP and additional cost reductions during third quarter 2016 to align our cost structure with current end market demand business, lower input costs and additional productivity initiatives offset the impact of lower absorption of fixed costs.    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   approximately   $1.0 million   to   $1.9 million  , or   7.4%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $2.9 million  , or   7.8%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely the result of cost savings initiatives to better align our cost structure with current demand levels. 
  Operating profit within Engineered Components   decreased   approximately $1.2 million to   $3.2 million  , or   12.1%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $4.4 million  , or   11.7%   of sales, in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Operating profit declined primarily due to lower sales levels; however, operating profit margin increased due to execution of our FIP and other cost savings actions, which allowed the engine business to remain near break-even levels despite the reduction in net sales.

Corporate Expenses.      Corporate expenses consist of the following (dollars in millions): 

Corporate expenses   increased   approximately $2.1 million to   $10.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $8.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Corporate operating expenses increased approximately $2.9 million, primarily due to approximately $3.5 million of costs related to the July 2016 change in our President and Chief Executive Officer.  These costs were partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of FIP related costs that were incurred in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016, and a decrease in third party professional fees of approximately $0.2 million. Employee costs and related benefits decreased approximately $0.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the timing and estimated attainment of our long-term incentive compensation, as well as lower employee levels following the FIP. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
  Overall, net sales   decreased   approximately   $62.7 million  , or approximately   9.3%  , to   $608.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $671.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by our Energy and Engineered Components reportable segments, for which combined sales decreased by approximately $61.6 million (excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange), primarily as a result of lower oil prices and weakness in the energy-facing end markets.  In addition, sales within our Aerospace reportable segment declined approximately $2.3 million, as a decline in OE and distribution customer sales more than offset increased sales of approximately $9.2 million related to the November 2015 machined components facility acquisition.  Foreign currency exchange resulted in an approximate $5.7 million reduction in sales due to net unfavorable currency exchange, primarily in our Packaging reportable segment, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.  These declines were partially offset by approximately $6.9 million in increased sales within our Packaging reportable segment, excluding the impact of currency exchange, primarily due to sales growth in our European and Asian markets of our health, beauty and home care end markets products and strength of the North American market in sales of our industrial end market products.   
  Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of sales) approximated   28.1%   and   27.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Gross profit margin improved primarily due to lower restructuring-related costs as compared to the prior year, primarily within our Energy reportable segment, and overall cost savings as a result of execution of our FIP and other cost savings actions. We incurred approximately $4.0 million lower material costs and direct labor in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year as a result of the year-over-year impact of the 2015 U.S. West Coast port delays, which caused us to temporarily produce certain products in higher cost facilities to meet demand levels.  The impact of these savings more than offset the margin impact of lower net sales levels and related lower fixed cost absorption, as well as the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in our Aerospace segment. In addition, gross profit decreased approximately $1.2 million as a result of the year-over-year impact of our reduction of an estimated acquisition liability in our Packaging segment in the third quarter of 2015, which did not recur in the current year.  Gross profit also decreased over the prior year by approximately $2.0 million as a result of unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.  
  Operating profit margin (operating profit as a percentage of sales) approximated   8.7%   and   9.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Operating profit   decreased   approximately   $10.9 million  , or   17.1%  , to   $52.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $63.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower sales year-over-year and due to manufacturing inefficiencies, lower fixed cost absorption and costs incurred to improve throughput and better support customer demand levels in our Aerospace segment, and the impact of lower sales and related fixed cost absorption in our Engineered Components segment. These impacts were partially offset by cost savings associated with the execution of our FIP and other cost savings actions and lower material and labor spending in our Energy reportable segment.

Interest expense decreased approximately   $0.4 million  , to   $10.2 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $10.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in our weighted-average variable rate borrowings to approximately   $461.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from approximately $676.8 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the distribution from Horizon to the Company in connection with the Cequent spin-off in June 2015, which the Company used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The effective weighted average interest rate on our outstanding variable rate borrowings, including our Credit Agreement and accounts receivable facilities, increased to approximately 2.1% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from approximately 1.8% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In addition, a portion of our 2015 interest expense was allocated to the Cequent businesses as part of the spin-off and was reclassified as discontinued operations. 
  We incurred debt financing and extinguishment costs of approximately   $2.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the amendment of our Credit Agreement in conjunction with the spin-off of the Cequent businesses. For more information on the amendment of our Credit Agreement, see Note   7  , "  Long-term Debt  ," to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
  Other expense, net decreased approximately $2.2 million, to   $0.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the year-over-year impact of realized foreign currency gains and losses and reductions of certain indemnification assets related to uncertain tax liabilities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. 
  The effective income tax rates for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   35.2%   and   34.2%  , respectively.  The increase in the rate was primarily a result of losses at certain foreign subsidiaries where no tax benefit could be recorded, and the year-over-year impact of recognizing certain tax benefits resulting from the reduction of certain tax positions due to a lapse of statutory limitations in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by earnings in foreign jurisdictions where the effective tax rate was less than 35%. 
  Net income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $4.5 million, to   $27.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a $10.9 million decrease in operating profit, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in other expense, net, a $2.0 million decrease in debt extinguishment costs, a $1.8 million decrease in income tax expense and a $0.4 million decrease in interest expense. 
  See below for a discussion of operating results by segment.  
   
  Packaging.      Net sales   increased   approximately   $2.1 million  , or   0.8%  , to   $258.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $256.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Sales of our health, beauty and home care products increased approximately $4.3 million due to growth in our European and Asian markets, and sales of our industrial products increased approximately $2.4 million primarily due to increased demand in the North American market.  Food and beverage products also increased approximately $0.2 million due to increased demand in the United States.  These increases were partially offset by approximately $4.8 million of unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
  Packaging's gross profit   increased   approximately   $0.7 million   to   $92.3 million  , or   35.7%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $91.6 million  , or   35.7%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Gross profit increased approximately $2.5 million due to higher sales levels, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as an increase of approximately $1.5 million due to a combination of improved overhead cost absorption and a more favorable product sales mix.  These increases were partially offset by the year-over-year impact of the reduction of an estimated acquisition liability in the third quarter of 2015 by approximately $1.2 million, which did not recur in the current year, and approximately $2.1 million of unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. 
  Packaging's selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   approximately   $1.4 million   to   $33.0 million  , or   12.7%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $31.6 million  , or   12.3%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to approximately $1.1 million of severance and other costs related to the closure of our existing Mexico manufacturing facility and establishment and move to the new manufacturing facility in Mexico, which is planned to begin production during the fourth quarter of 2016, and an approximate $1.1 million reduction in the Arminak contingent liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, professional fees increased approximately $1.2 million as a result of our front end reorganization to operate on a global versus regional basis, combined with other growth and product initiatives.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.1 million due the impact of foreign currency, with the remaining decrease primarily related to lower employee related costs as a result of execution of the FIP.

Packaging's operating profit   decreased   approximately   $0.8 million   to   $59.3 million  , or   23.0%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $60.1 million  , or   23.4%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Although sales levels increased, operating profit and related margin declined primarily due to the reduction in the Arminak contingent liability in 2015, which did not reoccur in the current year, costs related to the closure and move from our existing facility in Mexico to a new facility and higher professional fees. In addition, operating profit decreased approximately $0.9 million due to unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.  
   
  Aerospace.      Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $2.3 million  , or   1.7%  , to   $132.0 million  , as compared to   $134.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Sales to distribution customers declined by approximately $9.0 million, primarily as a result of certain large customers continuing planned reductions of their investment in on-hand inventory levels of certain fastener products.  Sales to OE customers decreased approximately $2.5 million, and while demand continued at expected levels, we experienced scheduling and production constraints which impacted our ability to meet current demand.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $9.2 million of sales related to the November 2015 machined components facility acquisition.  
  Gross profit within Aerospace   decreased   approximately $13.4 million to   $32.7 million  , or   24.8%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $46.1 million  , or   34.3%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Of this decrease in gross profit, approximately $5.5 million is a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and lower fixed cost absorption, primarily due to additional costs incurred to improve manufacturing throughput and better support customer demand levels. Gross profit also decreased by approximately $4.1 million due to the lower organic sales levels, by approximately $2.3 million due to a less favorable product sales mix and approximately $1.4 million related to integration and new product qualification costs for the acquired machined components facility.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   approximately   $4.6 million   to   $19.1 million  , or   14.4%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $23.7 million  , or   17.6%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to cost savings associated with the FIP, as well as charges related to operational and leadership changes incurred in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   that did not repeat in 2016. 
  Operating profit within Aerospace   decreased   approximately   $8.7 million   to   $13.7 million  , or   10.4%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $22.4 million  , or   16.7%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decline in operating profit and operating profit margin is primarily attributable to manufacturing inefficiencies and lower fixed cost absorption, a less favorable product sales mix and integration and new product qualification costs, which were partially offset by cost savings associated with the FIP and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of charges in 2015 related to operational and leadership changes. 
   
  Energy.      Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $30.0 million  , or   19.6%  , to   $122.9 million  , as compared to   $152.9 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Sales decreased by approximately $22.5 million in the United States and by approximately $5.1 million in our international branches, due to weaker upstream and downstream demand, primarily from the major oil and petrochemical refinery customers.  Sales further declined by approximately $1.4 million due to lower sales resulting from branch closures in Brazil, China and the Netherlands, and approximately $0.9 million of net unfavorable currency exchange, as our reported results in U.S. dollars were negatively impacted as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.   
  Gross profit within Energy   increased   approximately   $3.0 million   to   $26.5 million  , or   21.5%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $23.5 million  , or   15.4%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . While sales declined year-over-year, resulting in approximately $4.8 million lower gross profit, gross profit increased in total primarily due to approximately $4.0 million lower material costs as a result of costs incurred in 2015 as part of the U.S. West Coast port delays, which caused us to temporarily produce certain products in higher cost facilities to meet demand levels.  Additionally, gross profit increased by approximately $2.1 million as a result of lower restructuring-related costs as compared to the prior year. The remainder of the increase in gross profit is primarily due to lower labor and fixed costs as a result of the cost savings actions as part of the FIP.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses within Energy   increased   approximately   $1.1 million   to   $35.0 million  , or   28.5%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $33.9 million  , or   22.2%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to approximately $5.5 million of higher professional fees and other costs associated with our restructuring efforts.  In addition, we incurred approximately $1.0 million related to potentially uncollectable accounts receivable. These increases were partially offset by approximately $2.8 million of expenses incurred during the second quarter of 2015 to resolve a previous legal claim, which did not repeat in 2016, as well as lower ongoing costs as a result of the FIP and other cost cutting measures.

Overall, operating loss within Energy decreased approximately   $1.8 million   to a   $8.6 million   loss, or   7.0%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a   $10.4 million   loss, or   6.8%   of sales, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as the improvements in year-over-year operating performance as a result of the restructuring and FIP savings, as well as the impact of the 2015 legal claim and 2015 U.S. West Coast port delays, were mostly offset by the impact of the decrease in net sales. 
   
  Engineered Components.      Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $32.5 million  , or   25.5%  , to   $95.0 million  , as compared to   $127.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Sales of our engines and compression-related products declined approximately $18.2 million as a result of reduced levels of oil and gas drilling and well completions in the U.S. and Canada in response to lower oil prices. Sales of our industrial cylinders decreased by approximately $14.3 million, primarily due to lower demand for large high pressure gas cylinders in industrial applications. 
  Gross profit within Engineered Components   decreased   approximately   $6.3 million   to   $19.6 million  , or   20.6%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $25.9 million  , or   20.3%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the decreased sales levels. Gross profit margin from sales of our industrial cylinders increased as a result of lower input costs and ongoing productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of lower sales levels and lower fixed cost absorption. This was partially offset by decreased gross profit margin from sales of our engine and compression-related products as a result of lower fixed cost absorption despite cost reductions to better align our cost structure with current demand levels.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   approximately   $2.4 million   to   $6.9 million  , or   7.3%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $9.3 million  , or   7.3%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of our FIP and other cost savings initiatives for engine and compression-related products, as we reduced costs given the low oil-related activity to better align our cost structure with current demand levels. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses were lowered for industrial cylinder products as a result of lower demand for gas cylinders in industrial applications. 
  Operating profit within Engineered Components   decreased   approximately   $4.0 million   to   $12.6 million  , or   13.3%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to operating profit of   $16.6 million  , or   13.0%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Operating profit declined primarily due to lower sales levels; however, operating profit margin increased due to execution of our FIP and other cost savings actions, which allowed the engine business to remain near break-even levels despite the reduction in net sales. 
   
  Corporate Expenses.      Corporate expenses consist of the following (dollars in millions): 

Corporate expenses   decreased   approximately $0.7 million to   $24.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $24.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Corporate operating expenses increased approximately $1.3 million, primarily due to approximately $3.5 million of costs related to the July 2016 change in our President and Chief Executive Officer, which were partially offset by a decrease in third-party professional fees and other corporate costs of approximately $1.5 million, a favorable property tax assessment settlement in 2016 of approximately $0.4 million for a former business unit and approximately $0.3 million of FIP related costs that were incurred in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016. Employee costs and related benefits decreased approximately $2.0 million, primarily due to lower headcount following the Cequent spin-off as well as lower employee levels following the FIP, which were partially offset by an increase in expense related to the timing and estimated attainment of our long-term incentive compensation.  
  Discontinued Operations.      The results of discontinued operations consist of our former Cequent businesses, which were spun-off on June 30, 2015. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, was approximately   $4.7 million  . See Note   3  , "  Discontinued Operations,  " to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Cash Flows  
  Cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations were approximately   $46.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $28.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Significant changes in cash flows used for and provided by operating activities of continuing operations and the reasons for such changes are as follows:         
             
    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company generated approximately   $67.1 million   of cash, based on the reported net income of approximately   $27.6 million   and after considering the effects of non-cash items related to losses on dispositions of property and equipment, depreciation, amortization, changes in deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation and related tax effect and other, net.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company generated approximately   $68.1 million   in cash flows based on the reported income from continuing operations of approximately   $32.1 million   and after considering the effects of similar non-cash items.     
                
    Increases in accounts receivable resulted in a use of cash of approximately   $9.8 million   and   $15.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increased use of cash for each of the   nine   month periods is due primarily to the timing of sales and collection of cash within the periods. Days sales outstanding of receivables remained flat period-over-period. 
                
    Increases in inventory resulted in a use of cash of approximately   $4.6 million   and   $7.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the increase in our gross inventory levels is primarily as a result of lower than expected sales, as we operated at higher production levels earlier in the year in anticipation of higher customer demand. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the increase was primarily due to higher material sourcing costs and increased purchases related to U.S. West Coast port delays, mainly in our Energy reportable segment. 
                
    Decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets resulted in a cash source of approximately   $10.8 million   for the    nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the timing of certain domestic tax payments. Increases in prepaid expenses and other assets resulted in a cash use of approximately   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the timing of payments made for certain operating prepaid expenses.   
                
    Decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in a cash use of approximately   $17.2 million   and   $15.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The change in cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily a result of the timing of payments made to suppliers and mix of vendors and related terms. Our days accounts payable on hand remained flat period-over-period. 
     Net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $22.3 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we incurred approximately   $22.4 million   in capital expenditures, as we have continued our investment in growth, capacity and productivity-related capital projects. Cash received from the disposition of property and equipment was approximately   $0.1 million  .  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we incurred approximately   $20.4 million   in capital expenditures and received cash from the disposition of property and equipment of approximately   $1.7 million  . 
  Net cash used for financing activities of continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $21.0 million  , as compared to   $203.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we made net repayments of   $9.9 million   on our receivables and revolving credit facilities, and repaid approximately   $10.4 million   on our term loan. We also used a net cash amount of approximately   $0.7 million   related to our stock compensation arrangements. During the first   nine   months of   2015  , in conjunction with the spin-off of our former Cequent businesses, Horizon made a cash distribution to us of $214.5 million. We used the distribution received from Horizon to amend and pay down our term loan facilities. During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we had net additional repayments of approximately   $10.9 million   on our receivables and revolving credit facilities, and net additional repayments of approximately   $166.4 million   on our term loan facilities. We transferred cash of approximately   $17.1 million   during the period to Horizon, in connection with the spin-off. We also made deferred purchase price payments related to our previous acquisitions of approximately   $5.8 million  , we used approximately   $1.9 million   related to debt financing fees and used a net cash amount of approximately   $1.9 million   related to our stock compensation arrangements.

Our Debt and Other Commitments    
  We are party to a Credit Agreement, consisting of a   $500.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility, which permits borrowings denominated in specific foreign currencies ("Foreign Currency Loans"), subject to a   $75.0 million   sub limit, and a   $275.0 million   senior secured term loan A facility ("Term Loan A Facility"). The Credit Agreement matures on June 30, 2020 and is subject to interest at London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR") plus 1.75%. The interest rate spread is based upon the leverage ratio, as defined, as of the most recent determination date. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $261.2 million   was outstanding on the Term Loan A Facility and approximately   $97.2 million   was outstanding on the revolving credit facility.  The Credit Agreement allows issuance of letters of credit, not to exceed   $40.0 million   in aggregate, against revolving credit facility commitments, of which approximately   $16.3 million   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Credit Agreement also provides for incremental term loan facility and/or revolving credit commitments, not to exceed the greater of   $300.0 million   and an amount such that, after giving effect to the making of such commitments and the incurrence of any other indebtedness substantially simultaneously with the making of such commitments, the senior secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is no greater than   2.50   to 1.00. The terms and conditions of any incremental term loan and/or revolving credit facility commitments must be no more favorable than the existing credit facility.  
  We may be required to prepay a portion of our Term Loan A Facility in an amount equal to a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined, which such percentage will be based on our leverage ratio, as defined. As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts are due under this provision.  
  Amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility fluctuate daily based upon our working capital and other ordinary course needs. Availability under our revolving credit facility depends upon, among other things, compliance with our Credit Agreement's financial covenants. Our Credit Agreement contains various negative and affirmative covenants and other requirements affecting us and our subsidiaries, including restrictions on incurrence of debt, liens, mergers, investments, loans, advances, guarantee obligations, acquisitions, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging agreements, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, restrictive agreements and amendments to charters, bylaws, and other material documents. The terms of our Credit Agreement require us and our subsidiaries to meet certain restrictive financial covenants and ratios computed quarterly, including a maximum leverage ratio (total consolidated indebtedness plus outstanding amounts under the accounts receivable securitization facility over consolidated EBITDA, as defined) and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA, as defined, over cash interest expense, as defined).  Our permitted leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is   3.50   to 1.00 as of   September 30, 2016  . If we were to complete an acquisition which qualifies for a Covenant Holiday Period, as defined in our Credit Agreement, then our permitted leverage ratio cannot exceed   4.00   to 1.00 during that period.  Our actual leverage ratio was   2.94   to 1.00 at   September 30, 2016  . Our permitted interest expense coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is   3.00   to 1.00 as of   September 30, 2016  .  Our actual interest expense coverage ratio was   11.65   to 1.00 at   September 30, 2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our financial covenants.

     Another important source of liquidity is our   $75.0 million   accounts receivable facility, under which we have the ability to sell eligible accounts receivable to a third-party multi-seller receivables funding company. Our available liquidity under our accounts receivable facility has ranged from approximately   $54 million   to   $69 million   over the twelve months following the Cequent spin-off, depending on the level of our receivables outstanding at a given point in time during that period. We had approximately   $48.8 million   and   $53.6 million   outstanding under the facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and approximately   $8.6 million   and   $7.1 million   available but not utilized as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $97.2 million   outstanding under our revolving credit facility and had approximately   $386.5 million   potentially available after giving effect to approximately   $16.3 million   of letters of credit issued and outstanding. At   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $100.3 million   outstanding under our revolving credit fac  ility and had approximately     $378.1 million   potentially available after giving effect to approximately   $21.6 million   of letters of credit issued and outstanding. The letters of credit are used for a variety of purposes, including support of certain operating lease agreements, vendor payment terms and other subsidiary operating activities, and to meet various states' requirements to self-insure workers' compensation claims, including incurred but not reported claims. Including availability under our accounts receivable facility and after consideration of leverage restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $78.3 million   and   $107.4 million  , respectively, of borrowing capacity available for general corporate purposes.  
  We rely upon our cash flow from operations and available liquidity under our revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities to fund our debt service obligations and other contractual commitments, working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  At the end of each quarter, we use cash on hand from our domestic and foreign subsidiaries to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities.  
  Our combined weighted average monthly amounts outstanding on our Credit Agreement and our accounts receivable facility during the first   nine   months of   2016   approximated   $461.6 million  , compared to the weighted average monthly amounts outstanding during the first   nine   months of   2015   of approximately   $676.8 million  . The overall decrease is due primarily to the distribution received from the Cequent spin-off in June 2015. 
  Cash management related to our revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities is centralized. We monitor our cash position and available liquidity on a daily basis and forecast our cash needs on a weekly basis within the current quarter and on a monthly basis outside the current quarter over the remainder of the year. Our business and related cash forecasts are updated monthly. While the majority of our cash on hand as of   September 30, 2016   is located in jurisdictions outside the U.S., given aggregate available funding under our revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities of   $78.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , after consideration of the aforementioned leverage restrictions, and based on forecasted cash sources and requirements inherent in our business plans, we believe that our liquidity and capital resources, including anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our debt service, capital expenditure and other short-term and long-term obligation needs for the foreseeable future.

Our exposure to interest rate risk results from the variable rates under our Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at various rates, as more fully described in Note   7  , "  Long-term Debt  ," to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  We use interest rate swap agreements to fix the LIBOR-based variable portion of the interest rates on our term loan facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedge a declining notional value of debt ranging from approximately   $248.2 million   to approximately   $192.7 million  , with established fixed interest rates in a range of   0.74%   to   2.68%  , with various expiration terms extending to June 30, 2020. 
  We are subject to variable interest rates on our term loan and revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , 1-Month LIBOR approximated   0.53%  .  Based on our variable rate-based borrowings outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and after consideration of the interest rate swap agreement associated with our term loan A, a 1% increase in the per annum interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately   $1.6 million   annually.   
  Principal payments required under the Credit Agreement for the Term Loan A Facility are     $3.4 million     due each fiscal quarter from December 2015 through September 2018 and approximately     $5.2 million     due each fiscal quarter from December 2018 through March 2020, with final payment of   $202.8 million     due on June 30, 2020  .    
  In addition to our long-term debt, we have other cash commitments related to leases. We account for these lease transactions as operating leases, and annual rent expense for continuing operations related thereto approximated   $17.2 million   in 2015. We expect to continue to utilize leasing as a financing strategy in the future to meet capital expenditure needs and to reduce debt levels.  
   
  Market Risk  
  We conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are primarily the local currency in the country of domicile. We manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues and costs are generally denominated in local currencies; however, results of operations and assets and liabilities reported in U.S. dollars will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the U.S. dollar. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage currency risks associated with our procurement activities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries and the impact of currency rate volatility on our earnings.  
  We are also subject to interest risk as it relates to our long-term debt.  We use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variable rate debt to manage this risk.  See Note   8  , "  Derivative Instruments  ," included in Part 1, Item 1, "  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  ," within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

  TriMas is listed in the NASDAQ Global Select Market   SM   . Our stock trades under the symbol "TRS." 
   
  Credit Rating  
  We and certain of our outstanding debt obligations are rated by Standard   Poor's and Moody's. On June 9, 2016, Moody's affirmed a rating of Ba3 to our senior secured credit facilities, as presented in Note   7  ,   "Long-term Debt"   included in   Item 1  ,   "Consolidated Financial Statements"   within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Moody's also affirmed a Ba3 to our Corporate Family Rating and maintained our outlook as stable. On June 1, 2015, Standard   Poor's affirmed a BB- corporate credit rating to our amended credit facilities and maintained our outlook as stable. If our credit ratings were to decline, our ability to access certain financial markets may become limited, our cost of borrowings may increase, the perception of us in the view of our customers, suppliers and security holders may worsen and as a result, we may be adversely affected. 
   
  Outlook  
  We have experienced significant year-over-year top-line pressure across all of our end markets during 2016, primarily in our energy-facing businesses.  We managed to mitigate much of the impact of an approximate 9% year-over-year net sales decline with cost savings resulting from of our $22 million Financial Improvement Plan implemented during the back half of 2015 and via continued cost management and productivity initiatives.  While we expect fourth quarter of 2016 to be reasonably comparable to fourth quarter 2015, we believe the current uncertain macroeconomic environment will continue to persist. 
  While we continue to attempt to mitigate the challenging external factors impacting our top-line, we also continue to execute on internal projects that we control, including continued execution of our Aerospace production and scheduling improvements, optimizing our footprint to move more production to our lower-cost facilities while remaining responsive to our customers, pruning our product portfolios to deemphasize or no longer sell certain lower-margin products, seeking lower-cost sources for input costs and continuously assessing our fixed cost footprints.  We plan to execute on these internal initiatives which we believe will enable us to navigate through the current challenging environment until demand levels and activity increase, and position us for improved profitability and ability to leverage our lower fixed cost structure with higher sales levels.

  See Note   2  , "  New Accounting Pronouncements  ," included in Part 1, Item 1, "  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  ," within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
  Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends, and information from other outside sources, as appropriate.  
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in Part II, Item 7, "  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ," in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We are also subject to interest risk as it relates to long-term debt.  See Part I, Item 2, "  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  " for details about our primary market risks, and the objectives and strategies used to manage these risks. Also see Note   7  , "  Long-term Debt  ," and Note   8  , "  Derivative Instruments  ," in Part I, Item 1, "  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  ," included within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they will meet their objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that they would meet their objectives.  
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  
  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 1A.    Risk Factors  
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A., "  Risk Factors  ," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  There have been no significant changes in our risk factors as disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K except for the following, which we also disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016: 
  The results of the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.   
  In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process.  Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.  The results of the referendum have adversely impacted the British Pound and may continue to have an impact on other foreign currencies.  The referendum has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal.  These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our equity shares. Additionally, our Packaging business is dual headquartered in the United Kingdom and Indiana, and we operate other manufacturing facilities internationally, including in the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, the results of the referendum may have an adverse impact on our international operations, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 

SEPARATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT 
  This Separation and Release Agreement (this  Separation Agreement ) between TRIMAS CORPORATION (the  Company ) and David M. Wathen ( you  and similar words) sets forth certain terms of your separation from the Company, including certain waivers and releases by you required under the Company s Executive Severance/Change of Control Policy, effective as of August 13, 2013 (the  Severance Policy ), in order to receive certain separation payments and benefits, as set forth in detail below. 
  By signing this Separation Agreement, you and the Company agree as follows: 
  1.  Status of Employment 
    
  You agree that you will terminate from your positions as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company effective July 25, 2016 (the  Separation Date ) and such termination shall be treated as set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Separation Agreement.  You also agree that, as of the Separation Date, you will terminate from all other positions you hold as an officer, employee or director of the Company s subsidiaries and affiliates, and that you will promptly execute any documents and take any actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to effectuate or memorialize your termination from all positions with the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
  2.  Severance Benefits 
    
  In consideration for you signing this Separation Agreement no earlier than the Separation Date and no later than 52 days following the Separation Date, and letting this Separation Agreement become effective as set forth in Paragraph 8 below, for purposes of the Severance Policy and this Agreement, your separation from the Company will be deemed a termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the Severance Policy), and you will receive the payments and benefits as specified on   Exhibit A   attached hereto, all subject to applicable tax withholding (the  Severance Benefits ).  The Severance Benefits will be in full satisfaction of any amounts due under the Severance Policy and other compensation arrangements of the Company. 
  3.  Restrictive Covenants 
    
  By signing this Separation Agreement, you reaffirm that you will continue to abide by the covenants set forth in Section 7 of the Severance Policy, which expressly survive the termination of your employment without Cause. 
  4.  Limitations 
    
  Nothing in this Separation Agreement or the Severance Policy shall be binding upon the parties to the extent it is void or unenforceable for any reason, including, without limitation, as a result of any law regulating competition or proscribing unlawful business practices;   provided, however  , that to the extent that any provision in this Separation Agreement or the Severance Policy could be modified to render it enforceable under applicable law, it shall be deemed so modified and enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law. 
  5.  Waiver and Release 
    
  In exchange for the Severance Benefits the Company will provide you under this Separation Agreement, you release and forever discharge the Company, any and all past, present or future parents,  
  
   -  1  - 

subsidiaries and affiliates (the  TriMas Companies ), and any and all past, present, or future related persons or entities, including but not limited to the Company s and the TriMas Companies  officers, directors, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, attorneys, successors and assigns, specifically including without limitation TriMas Corporation (the  Released Parties ), from any and all actions, claims, demands and damages, whether actual or potential, known or unknown, and specifically but not exclusively, which you may have or claim to have against the Released Parties as of the date you sign this Separation Agreement including, without limitation, any and all claims related or in any manner incidental to your employment with the Company or termination of that employment relationship ( claims ) which you or your heirs, successors, executors, or other representatives may have. All such claims are forever barred by this Separation Agreement regardless of the forum in which such claims might be brought, including, but not limited to, claims (a) under any federal, state or local law governing the employment relationship or its termination (including, but not limited to, Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Family Medical Leave Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; the Rehabilitation Act; the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act; any state, local, and other federal employment laws; and any amendments to any of the foregoing) and/or (b) under the common law for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, personal injuries and/or torts.   You understand that this is a general waiver and release of all claims, known or unknown, that you may have against the Released Parties based on any act, omission, matter, cause or thing that occurred through the date of your execution of this Separation Agreement. 
  The above release does not waive claims (i) for vested rights under employee benefit plans as applicable on the date you sign this Separation Agreement, (ii) that may arise after you sign this Separation Agreement, (iii) which cannot be released by private agreement or (iv) to enforce the terms of this Separation Agreement, including the payment of the compensation and benefits specified in   Exhibit A  . 
  6.  Other Acknowledgements 
    
  You understand that following the Effective Date (as defined in Paragraph 8 of this Separation Agreement) this release will be final and binding.  You further understand that nothing in this release generally prevents you from filing a charge or complaint with or from participating in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC, NLRB, or any other federal, state or local agency charged with the enforcement of any employment laws, although by signing this release you are waiving your right to individual relief based on claims asserted in such a charge or complaint.  By executing this Separation Agreement you represent that, as of the date you sign this Separation Agreement, no claims, lawsuits, or charges have been filed by you or on your behalf against the Released Parties.  The Company agrees that this Separation Agreement does not extend to, release or modify any rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which you are entitled from the Company or its insurers under the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, or other corporate governing law or instruments.  You and the Company also acknowledge and agree that, with respect to the performance stock unit awards ( PSUs ) previously granted by the Company to you under the TriMas Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2011 Equity Plan ), because of the award grant limitations contained in the 2011 Equity Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the  Committee ) has determined that such PSUs were, automatically by operation of the terms of the 2011 Equity Plan, limited at the time of grant so that the maximum award opportunity levels for the PSUs would not cause such award grant limitations to be exceeded, and that the Committee has taken action to reflect the effective terms of such PSUs. 
  7.  Material Breach 
    
  You agree that in the event of any breach of any provision of Section 7 of the Severance Policy, the Company will be entitled to equitable and/or injunctive relief and, because the damages for such a  
  
   -  2  - 

breach will be impossible or impractical to determine and will not therefore provide a full and adequate remedy, the Company or TriMas Companies will also be entitled to specific performance by you. No amount owing to you under this Separation Agreement shall be subject to set-off or reduction by reason of any claims which the Company has or may have against you.  You will be entitled to recover actual damages if the Company breaches this Separation Agreement, including any unexcused late or non-payment of any amounts owed under this Separation Agreement, or any unexcused failure to provide any other benefits specified in this Separation Agreement.  Failure by either party to enforce any term of condition of this Separation Agreement at any time shall not preclude that party from enforcing that provision, or any other provision, at a later time. 
  8.  Review of Separation Agreement

You are advised to review it carefully and consult an attorney before signing it, as well as any other professional whose advice you value, such as an accountant or financial advisor.

Exhibit 10.2 

July 22, 2016 

Mr. Thomas Amato 

Dear Tom, 

On behalf of the TriMas Board of Directors, we are delighted to extend to you an offer of employment as President and Chief Executive Officer of TriMas Corporation. 
    
  If you return a signed copy of this letter to us by July 25, 2016, then, subject to the Board's acceptance of this letter, your employment with TriMas will begin on [    ], 2016, or such later date as may be set by the Board ("Start Date"). 
    
  We also intend to elect you as a member of TriMas Corporation's Board of Directors. As President and CEO, you will report to the Board of Directors. The general terms and conditions of this offer are as follows: 
    
  Salary:          $625,000 annually; compensation is paid bi-weekly; subject to annual review 
    
  Annual Bonus:     You will be eligible to participate in the TriMas Short Term Incentive Plan (the  STI Plan ) beginning for fiscal year 2017. Your annual target award will be one hundred percent (100%) of base salary for each year with the potential to achieve two hundred percent (200%) of your base salary. Achievement of this award will be determined by both the performance of TriMas Corporation and your personal performance. It will be one of your responsibilities to recommend to the Compensation Committee and the Board the appropriate metrics and payout ranges for all other executives under the STI Plan, and it is understood that the Board may choose to apply certain specific metrics to evaluate your performance that are different from those for other corporate executives. 
    
  Incentives  
           Transition:    
    Given that you have not been responsible for setting the targets for the STI Plan or Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) grants for fiscal year 2016, you will not participate in those programs for plan year 2016.  In lieu of that participation, you will receive the long term compensation outlined below.   
       
  Long Term 
  Incentive 
           Compensation: 
    On the date of your initial employment with TriMas, you will be granted 150,000 stock options with an exercise price set by the fair market value of TriMas  stock on the grant date (generally annual vesting in equal increments over a 3 year period, subject to the terms of TriMas  standard stock option award agreement).  
       
  Subsequent Annual LTIP Grants: 
    
  Assuming satisfactory performance and continued employment, it is the Board's intention that starting for plan year 2017, you will receive annual LTIP grants. It will be one of your responsibilities to recommend to the Compensation Committee and the Board appropriate metrics  

for TriMas' LTIP target grants. The Board will make future grants based on individual and company performance targets and in a form established by the Board. 
    
  Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, you will be eligible for a target annual LTIP grant with an expected value of $2,000,000, starting with the March 2017 grant, which will be made in the form of at least 50% in Performance Stock Units (same plan design as other executives which currently uses relative total shareholder return vs. peers) with the balance in time-based Restricted Stock Units.  
    
           Benefits: 
    You will be eligible to participate in the TriMas benefits program for senior executives. Additionally, TriMas will provide health care, group life insurance, short   long-term disability coverage, accidental death   dismemberment insurance and executive retirement benefits that are available to all employees. TriMas requires dependent verification be provided for each dependent covered under the TriMas plans to confirm dependent eligibility. TriMas does not allow personal use of corporate aircraft. 
       
  Retirement  
           Savings:  
    Participation in the Company s 401(k) program at the same level of all other employees and inclusion in any other retirement program approved by the Board that is open to other executives and top officers.      A few of our existing senior executives are participants in a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program ( SERP ).  It is the Board s intention to phase out these plans, and consequently, SERPs are not being offered to new executives.  You will, however, participate in the Compensation Limit Restoration Plan.        
       
           Perquisites:  
    Existing executives have the benefit of a cash perquisite plan that replaced a package of prior benefits.  It is the Board s intention to phase out these plans, and, consequently, such perquisites are not being offered to new executives.   
       
  Severance  
           Policy:    
    The protections of the TriMas Executive Severance/Change of Control Policy will be applicable to you as President and Chief Executive Officer.  However, the Board intends to make some modifications to these provisions.  In the event of a  Termination without Cause  (as described in such policy), you will receive cash severance equal to 1x the sum of base salary and target bonus, and in the event of a  Termination Following a Change of Control  (as described in such policy), you will receive cash severance equal to 2x the sum of base salary and target bonus. 
       
           Vacation: 
    You will be entitled to four (4) weeks of vacation annually. 

We are looking forward to having you become President and Chief Executive Officer of TriMas Corporation. We are highly confident in your ability to lead the organization in the successful growth and performance of the business. 
    
  This letter is not intended to be a contract of employment. It describes the initial terms of employment that will apply.  The Board reserves the right to modify the terms of your employment at any time, and your employment can be terminated by you or the company at any time with or without reason, subject to the TriMas Executive Severance/Change of Control policy (as that policy may be modified from time to time).  If this letter accurately reflects your understanding of the offer, please indicate your understanding and acceptance by signing a copy of this letter and returning it to us. 

Very truly yours,

II. 
    AGREEMENT 
       
  A.  Grant of Option  .  The Corporation has granted to Optionee an Option to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the Option Price set forth in the Notice of Grant (the    Exercise Price   ).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary anywhere else in this Agreement, the Option is subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference.  This Option is not intended to constitute an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. 
    
  B.  Exercise of Option  .  This Option is exercisable as follows: 
    
  (1)  Right to Exercise  . 
  
   -  1  - 

(a)  This Option shall be exercisable cumulatively according to the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant.  For purposes of this Agreement, this Option shall vest based on Optionee s continued status as a Service Provider. 
    
  (b)  This Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 
    
  (c)  In the event of Optionee s death, Disability or other termination of Optionee s status as a Service Provider, the exercisability of the Option shall be governed as set forth in E through H below. 
    
  (d)  In no event may this Option be exercised after the date of expiration of the term of this Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant. 
    
  (2)  Method of Exercise  .  This Option shall be exercisable by written notice (substantially in a form acceptable to the Corporation) (   Exercise Notice   ).  The Exercise Notice must state the number of Shares for which the Option is being exercised and contain such other representations and agreements with respect to such Shares as may be required by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.  The Exercise Notice must be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price   plus   payment of any applicable income and employment withholding taxes.  This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Corporation of such Exercise Notice accompanied by the Exercise Price and payment of any applicable withholding taxes. 
    
  No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of the Option unless such issuance and exercise comply with all relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed.  Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares shall be considered transferred to Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to such Shares. 
    
  C.  Method of Payment  .  Payment of the Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of Optionee: 
    
  (1)  cash;

  (3)  subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Committee, the Corporation s withholding Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to a  net exercise  arrangement; or 
    
  (4)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. 
    
  D.  Restrictions on Exercise  .  If the issuance of Shares upon exercise or if the method of payment for such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities or other law or regulation, the Option may not be exercised.  The Corporation may require Optionee to make any representation and warranty to the Corporation as may be required by any applicable law or regulation before allowing the Option to be exercised. 
    
  E.  Termination of Relationship  .  If Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider (other than by reason of a termination by the Corporation for Cause or Optionee s death or Disability), to the extent vested as of the date on which Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider (taking into consideration any vesting that may occur in connection with such termination), the Option shall remain exercisable for ninety (90) days following such date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).  To the extent that the Option is not vested as of the date on which Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, or if Optionee does not exercise the Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 
    
  F.  Termination for Cause  .  If Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider by reason of a termination by the Corporation for Cause, the Option shall terminate as of the start of business on the date of Optionee s termination, regardless of whether the Option is then vested and/or exercisable with respect to any Shares. 
  
   -  2  - 

G.  Disability of Optionee  .  If Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of Disability, the Option, to the extent vested as of the date on which Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months from such date (but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).

  H.  Death of Optionee  .  If Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of Optionee s death, the Option, to the extent vested as of the date of death, shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant) by Optionee s estate or by a person who acquires the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance.  To the extent that the Option is not vested as of the date of death, or if the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. 
    
  I.  Non-Transferability of Option  .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, without advance approval by the Committee, this Option (1) may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by laws of descent or distribution, and (2) may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee.  The terms of this Option shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of Optionee. 
    
  J.  Term of Option  .  This Option may be exercised only within the term set forth in the Notice of Grant. 
    
  K.  Restrictions on Shares  .

  M.  No Right to Employment  .  The Option is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.  The Option and any related payments made to Optionee will not be considered salary or other compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law.  Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon Optionee any right to continue as an employee, director or consultant of the Corporation or any parent or Subsidiary, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation or any parent or Subsidiary, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written employment agreement between Optionee and the Corporation or any parent or Subsidiary. 
    
  N.  Relation to Other Benefits  .  Any economic or other benefit to Optionee under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which Optionee may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 
    
  O.  Amendments  .  Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto;   provided  ,   however  , that no amendment shall adversely affect Optionee s rights with respect to the Option without Optionee s consent and Optionee s consent shall not be required to an amendment that is deemed necessary by the Corporation to ensure compliance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 

-  3  - 

P.  Severability  .  In the event that one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable. 
    
  Q.  Relation to Plan  .  The Committee acting pursuant to the Plan, as constituted from time to time, shall, except as expressly provided otherwise herein or in the Plan, have the right to determine any questions which arise in connection with this Agreement.

Further, this Option will be subject to mandatory adjustment as provided in Section 17 of the Plan. 
    
  R.  Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent that the Corporation is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any payment made to or benefit realized by Optionee or other person under the Option, Optionee authorizes the Corporation or Optionee s employer to withhold from the Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise of the Option, as payment, the number of shares needed to satisfy any applicable minimum withholding obligations; or Optionee agrees to tender sufficient funds to satisfy any withholding obligations in connection with the exercise of the Option.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan, the Corporation shall not be obligated to guarantee any particular tax result for Optionee with respect to  
  
   -  4  - 

any benefit provided to Optionee hereunder, and Optionee shall be responsible for any taxes imposed on Optionee with respect to any such benefit.

  T.  Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed with the internal substantive laws of the State of Michigan, without giving effect to any principle of law that would result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.
