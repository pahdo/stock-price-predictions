NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    OCTOBER 31, 2016   (Unaudited)      NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS      Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 5, 2012. We were founded to be in the business of translation and interpretation. The Company undertook translation and interpretation projects for various fields from business, economics, to science issues. All operating projects were customer tailored with freelancers that operated in their mother-tongue. We are presently in the process of exploring other business opportunities. The Company adopted a business plan to pursue business opportunities in the global telecommunications industry.      On September 30, 2016, Vibe Wireless Corp. (the "Company") filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the  Nevada SOS ) whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing the Company s authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 750 million and increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of ten (10) shares for every one (1) share held. The Company s Board of Directors approved this amendment on September 30, 2016.     On September 30, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to  Green Vision Biotechnology Corp.      On September 30, 2016, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with FINRA requesting that the aforementioned forward split and name change be effected in the market. The Company also requested that its ticker symbol be changed to  GVBT . Such notification form is being reviewed by FINRA. This name change and our ticker symbol change was acknowledged by FINRA and effected in the market on November 27, 2016.       NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN       BASIS OF ACCOUNTING      The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required for an annual set of financial statements prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of October 31, 2016 and for all interim periods presented herein have been reflected in these financial statements and the notes there to. Interim results for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes as included in the Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016.                 6       
      Table of Contents           GOING CONCERN      The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company has incurred losses resulting in an accumulated deficit of $133,511 as of October 31, 2016.  and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and, or, private placement of common stock.  These financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.      NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      On August 28, 2015, the Company s officer and director entered into an agreement to loan up to $50,000 to the Company, accruing interest at 8%, due on September 1, 2016, and unsecured. The maturity date has been extended by agreement to January 30, 2017. As of October 31, 2016 the Company has received $47,115 in loan proceeds under this agreement, including $12,351 loaned during the nine months ended October 31, 2016. The Company has accrued interest of $3,615 under the agreement as of October 31, 2016.      Beginning in September 2016, in conjunction with a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Vision Biotechnology Corp, certain shareholders of Green Vision agreed to loan the Company funds on an on-going basis to be used for working capital accruing interest at 8%, due on January 31, 2018. The Company has received $35,250 in loans as of October 31, 2016 and accrued interest of $1,058.     The balance due to advances and loans from related parties was $82,365 and $34,764 as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016 respectively.                        7       
      Table of Contents          FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS     Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements". These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.        ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION        GENERAL     On November 12, 2015, we changed our name to Vibe Wireless Corp in connection with merging with our wholly-owned subsidiary and adopted a business plan to pursue business opportunities in the global telecommunications industry. This name change and our ticker symbol change was acknowledged by FINRA and effected in the market on November 23, 2015.     On September 30, 2016, Vibe Wireless Corp. (the "Company") filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the  Nevada SOS ) whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing the Company s authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 750 million and increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of ten (10) shares for every one (1) share held. The Company s Board of Directors approved this amendment on September 30, 2016.     On September 30, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to  Green Vision Biotechnology Corp.      On September 30, 2016, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with FINRA requesting that the aforementioned forward split and name change be effected in the market. The Company also requested that its ticker symbol be changed to  GVBT . Such notification form is being reviewed by FINRA. This name change and our ticker symbol change was acknowledged by FINRA and effected in the market on November 27, 2016.        Results of Operations       Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.     We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.                 8       
      Table of Contents           Nine Month Period Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to Nine Month Period Ended October 31, 2015      Our net loss for the nine month period ended October 31, 2016 was $52,548 compared to a net loss of $15,493 for the nine month period ended October 31, 2015. During the nine-month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we have not generated any revenue.     During the nine month period ended October 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $ 52,548 compared to $15,493  incurred for the nine month period ended October 31, 2015. General and administrative fee expenses incurred during the nine month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services.     The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 60,790,000 for the nine month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.      Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2015      Our net loss for the three month period ended October 31, 2016 was $ 35,593 compared to a net loss of $5,918 for the three month period ended October 31, 2015. During the three-month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we have not generated any revenue.     During the three month period ended October 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $35,593 compared to $5,918  incurred for the three month period ended October 31, 2015. General and administrative fee expenses incurred during the three month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services.     The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 60,790,000 for the period ended October 31, 2015 and 2014.       Liquidity and Capital Resources        Nine Month Period Ended October 31, 2016       As of October 31, 2016, our total assets were $0 compared to $0 in total assets at January 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, our current liabilities were $ 89,583 Stockholders  deficit was $89,583 as of October 31, 2016 compared to stockholders' deficit of $37,035 as of January 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of $89,583.                 9       
      Table of Contents           Cash Flows from Operating Activities      We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine month period ended October 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $47,601. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $9,125 for the nine month period ended October 31, 2015.      Cash Flows from Investing Activities      For the nine month period ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not generated any cash flows from investing activities.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities      Since inception we have financed our operations primarily from either advances from directors, officers, the issuance of equity, or loans from related parties. For the nine month period ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $47,601 loaned from related parties, compared to $8,950 in net cash provided during the same period from the previous year which consisted loans from affiliated parties.       Plan of Operation and Funding       We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, loans from affiliated parties, other debt facilities, or further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.     Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of operating equipment; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.             Going Concern       The independent auditors' report accompanying our January 31, 2016 audited financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.        ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.        No report required.        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine month period ended October 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II. OTHER INFORMATION          ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS        Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.        ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS        No report required.        ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES        No report required.        ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS        No report required.        ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION        Through December 16, 2016, Zhen Hui Certified Public Accountants, with offices located in Hong Kong ( Zhen Hui ) was the independent registered public accounting firm of Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. (previously known as Vibe Wireless Corp.) (the "Company"), for a limited timeframe. On December 16, 2016, the Company notified Zhen Hui that it was dismissing Zhen Hui as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The Company s Board of Directors approved this action.      Zhen Hui, independent registered public accounting firm from October 7, 2016 to December 16, 2016, as such did not conduct any audit or review of the Company s financial statement and therefore never issued an audit report.     During the Company's fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015 and through December 16, 2016, there were no disagreements (as defined in item 304 of Regulation S-K) with Zhen Hui on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Zhen Hui, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their report.            The Company furnished Zhen Hui with a copy of this disclosure on December 16, 2016, providing Zhen Hui with the opportunity to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether they agree with the statements made by the Company herein in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K and, if not, stating the respect in which they do not agree. As of the filing of this report, the Company has not received a copy of Zhen Hui letter addressed to the Commission whether they agree with the statements made herein. Upon receipt thereof, the Company will file a copy of such letter with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
