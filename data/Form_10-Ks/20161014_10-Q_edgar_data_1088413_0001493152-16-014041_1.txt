     Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

Note
1. Basis of Financial Statements  

In
the opinion of Greystone Logistics, Inc. ( Greystone ), the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments and reclassifications, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly its financial
position as of August 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three-month periods ended August
31, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 and the notes thereto included in Greystone s Form 10-K for
such period. The results of operations for the three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.  

The
consolidated financial statements of Greystone include its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C. ( GSM )
and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. ( PPP ), and its variable interest entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. ( GRE ).
GRE owns two buildings located in Bettendorf, Iowa which are leased to GSM.  

Effective
June 1, 2016, Greystone adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
 which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the
associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. Accordingly, Greystone retrospectively applied
the guidance to the May 31, 2016 balance by reclassifying debt issue costs of $69,185, net of amortization, previously reported
as other assets to long-term debt.  

Note
2. Earnings Per Share  

Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing
net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise
or conversion of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.  

Greystone
excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect of including such instruments is
anti-dilutive. For the three months ended  August 31, 2016 and 2015 ,  e quity
instruments which have been excluded are Greystone s convertible preferred stock which is convertible into 3,333,334 shares
of common stock and common stock options to purchase 200,000 and 1,150,000 of common stock, respectively.  

Note
3. Inventory  

Inventory
consists of the following:  

Note
4. Property, Plant and Equipment  

A
summary of the property, plant and equipment for Greystone is as follows:  

Production
machinery and equipment includes equipment capitalized pursuant to a capital lease in the amount of $2,731,152. The equipment
is being depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over 10 years.  

Production
machinery includes deposits on equipment in the amount of $159,698 that had not been placed into service as of August 31, 2016.
The plant buildings and land are owned by GRE, a VIE, and have a net book value of $3,215,197 at August 31, 2016.  

Depreciation
expense for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 is $518,576 and $378,966, respectively.

as of August 31, 2016 was 3.5%. 

Loan Agreement between Greystone and
International Bank of Commerce ( IBC )   

On January 31, 2014, Greystone
and GSM (the  Borrowers ) and International Bank of Commerce ( IBC ) entered into a Loan Agreement (the
 IBC Loan Agreement ). The IBC Loan Agreement provides for a revolving loan in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $2,500,000 (the  Revolving Loan ) and a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $9,200,000 (the  Term
Loan ). The exact amount which can be borrowed under the Revolving Loan from time to time is dependent upon the amount of
the borrowing base, but can in no event exceed $2,500,000. On January 7, 2016, the Borrowers and IBC entered into the First Amendment
to the IBC Loan Agreement (the  First Amendment ) whereby IBC made an additional term loan to Borrowers in the original
principal amount of $2,530,072 (the  New Equipment Loan ). The New Equipment Loan and $2,917,422 of the principal
amount outstanding on the Term Loan were consolidated into a new loan in the combined principal amount of $5,447,504 (the  Term
Loan A ). The Term Loan s remaining principal balance of $3,000,000 was deemed to be a separate term loan (the  Term
Loan B ). 

The Term Loans A and B
bear interest at the New York Prime Rate plus 0.5% but not less than 4.0% and mature January 7, 2019. The Borrowers are required
to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest in such amounts sufficient to amortize the principal balance of (i) the
Note A Term Loan over a seven year period beginning January 31, 2016 (currently $74,455 per month) and (ii) the Note B Term Loan
over the three-year life of the loan (currently $88,790 per month). 

The Revolving Loan bears
interest at the New York Prime Rate plus 0.5% but not less than 4.0% and matures January 31, 2018. The Borrowers are required
to pay all interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan on a monthly basis. Any principal on the
Revolving Loan that is prepaid by the Borrowers does not reduce the original amount available to the Borrowers. 

The IBC Loan Agreement
includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants which include (i) requiring the Borrowers
to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1:25 to 1:00 and a funded debt to EBIDA ratio not exceeding 3:00 to 1:00, (ii) subject
to certain exceptions, limiting the Borrowers  combined capital expenditures on fixed assets to $1,000,000 per year, (iii)
prohibiting Greystone, without IBC s prior written consent, from declaring or paying any dividends, redemptions of stock
or membership interests, distributions and withdrawals (as applicable) in respect of its capital stock or any other equity interest,
other than additional payments to holders of its preferred stock in an amount not to exceed $500,000 in any fiscal year, (iv)
subject to certain exceptions, prohibiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness by the Borrowers, and (v) requiring the Borrowers
to prevent (A) any change in capital ownership such that there is a material change in the direct or indirect ownership of (1)
Greystone s outstanding preferred stock, and (2) any equity interest in GSM, or (B) Warren Kruger from ceasing to be actively
involved in the management of Greystone as President and/or Chief Executive Officer. The foregoing list of covenants is not exhaustive
and there are several other covenants contained in the IBC Loan Agreement. 

Greystone s debt
service coverage ratio at August 31, 2016 was 0.84 which is not in compliance with the IBC Loan Agreement s minimum debt
service coverage ratio of 1.25. Greystone has received a waiver from IBC for this instance of non-compliance. 

The IBC Loan Agreement
includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal and other amounts owing
under the IBC Loan Agreement from time to time, inaccuracy of representations, violation of covenants, defaults under other agreements,
bankruptcy and similar events, the death of a guarantor, certain material adverse changes relating to a Borrower or guarantor,
certain judgments or awards against a Borrower, or government action affecting a Borrower s or guarantor s ability
to perform under the IBC Loan Agreement or the related loan documents. Among other things, a default under the IBC Loan Agreement
would permit IBC to cease lending funds under the IBC Loan Agreement, and require immediate repayment of any outstanding loans
with interest and any unpaid accrued fees. 

The IBC Loan Agreement
is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers. In addition, the IBC Loan Agreement is secured by a
mortgage granted by GRE on the real property owned by GRE in Bettendorf, Iowa (the  Mortgage ). GRE is owned by Warren
F. Kruger, Greystone s President and CEO, and Robert B. Rosene, Jr., a director of Greystone. Messrs. Kruger and Rosene
have provided a combined limited guaranty of the Borrowers  obligations under the IBC Loan Agreement, with such guaranty
being limited to a combined amount of $6,500,000 (the  Guaranty ). The Mortgage and the Guaranty also secure or guaranty,
as applicable, the obligations of GRE under the Loan Agreement between GRE and IBC dated January 31, 2014, as discussed in the
following paragraph. 

Loan Agreement between GRE and IBC   

On January 31, 2014, GRE
and IBC entered into a Loan Agreement which provided for a mortgage loan to GRE of $3,412,500. The loan provides for a 4.5% interest
rate and a maturity of January 31, 2019 and is secured by a mortgage on the two buildings in Bettendorf, Iowa which are leased
to Greystone. 

Capital Lease with Private Pallet Leasing
Company   

In August, 2016, Greystone
entered into a three-year lease agreement with a private pallet leasing company to provide for certain production equipment with
a total cost of approximately $5.4 million. The lease agreement includes a bargain purchase option to acquire the production equipment
at the end of the lease term. The lease is for two Milacron injection molding machines and two pallet molds designed and dedicated
to production of 48X40 pallets (the  Pallets ) for the pallet leasing company. Monthly lease payments, estimated at
approximately $100,000 per machine, are payable on a per invoice basis at the rate of $6.25 for each pallet produced by the leased
production equipment and shipped to the company. The lease bears an interest rate of 5%, has a three-year maturity and provides
for minimum monthly lease rental payment based upon the total Pallets sold in excess of a specified amount not to exceed the monthly
productive capacity of the leased machines. 

The first of the Milacron
machines was placed into service in August, 2016. The second machine was placed into service in September, 2016 under the same
terms and conditions as the first machine. Maturities for the three years subsequent to August 31, 2016 for the capital lease
placed in service in August, 2016 are estimated to be $1,091,375, $1,147,092 and $433,611. 

Note Payable between Greystone and Robert
B. Rosene, Jr.   

Effective December 15,
2005, Greystone entered into an agreement with Robert B. Rosene, Jr., a member of Greystone s board of directors, to convert
$2,066,000 of advances into a note payable at 7.5% interest. Effective June 1, 2016, the note was restated (the  Restated
Note ) to combine the outstanding principal, $2,066,000, and accrued interest, $2,475,690, into a note payable of $4,541,690
with an extended maturity date of January 15, 2018. The Restated Note provides that accrued interest is payable monthly and allows
Greystone to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay such amounts as allowed by the IBC Loan Agreement against the interest
accrued prior to the restatement. 

Note Payable between Greystone and Yorktown
Management Financial Services, LLC ( Yorktown )   

On February 29, 2016,
Greystone entered into an unsecured note payable to Yorktown in the amount of $688,296 in connection with the acquisition of equipment
from Yorktown. The note payable bears interest at the rate of 5% and is payable over three years with monthly principal and interest
payments of $20,629. 

Maturities   

Maturities of Greystone s
long-term debt and capital leases for the five years subsequent to August 31, 2016 are $3,201,905, $9,564,108, $7,309,827, $7,736
and $-0-. 

Note 7. Stock Compensation Costs 

Stock compensation costs,
resulting from stock options issued June 1, 2012, were $-0- and $13,356 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following methods
and assumptions are used in estimating the fair-value disclosures for financial instruments: 

Debt: The carrying amount
of loans with floating rates of interest approximate fair value. Fixed rate loans are valued based on cash flows using estimated
rates of comparable loans. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value. 

Note 9. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ) which creates a comprehensive set of guidelines for the recognition
of revenue under the principle:  Recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
The requirements of ASU 2014-09 will require either retrospective application to each prior period presented or retrospective
application with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of adoption. Greystone is currently
evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial position and results of operations. On July 9, 2015, FASB voted to approve
a one-year deferral of the effective date such that the effective date for Greystone s interim and annual periods begins
June 1, 2018. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing
transactions. The ASU will require organizations ( lessees ) that lease assets with lease terms of more than twelve
months to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Organizations
that own the assets leased by lessees ( lessors ) will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP. In addition, the
ASU will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty
of cash flows arising from leases. The effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and interim
periods within that year. Greystone is currently reviewing the ASU to assess the potential impact on the consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued
Accounting Standards 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation . The objective of this amendment is part of the FASB s Simplification Initiative as it applies
to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The effective date of the amendment
is for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Greystone is currently
reviewing the ASU to assess the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Note 10. Concentrations, Risks and Uncertainties 

In fiscal year 2017, Greystone
derived 66% of its total sales from two customers (36% and 30% respectively). In fiscal year 2016, there was one significant customer
which accounted for approximately 31% of Greystone s total sales. The loss of a material amount of business from these customers
could have a material adverse effect on Greystone. 

Greystone purchases damaged
pallets from its customer at a price based on the value of the raw material content in the pallet. A majority of these purchases,
totaling $478,752 and $490,092 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, is from one of its major customers. 

Robert B. Rosene, Jr.,
a Greystone director, has provided financing and guarantees on Greystone s bank debt. As of August 31, 2016, Greystone is
indebted to Mr. Rosene in the amount of $4,541,690 pursuant to a note payable due January 15, 2018. There is no assurance that
Mr. Rosene will continue to provide extensions in the future. 

Note 11. Subsequent Event 

Effective September 1,
2016, Greystone s board of directors authorized the issuance of warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of Greystone s

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Results of Operations   

General to All Periods  

The unaudited consolidated
statements include Greystone Logistics, Inc., its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C. ( GSM )
and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. ( PPP ). Greystone also consolidates its variable interest entity, Greystone Real
Estate, L.L.C. ( GRE ). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

References to fiscal year
2017 refer to the three month period ended August 31, 2016. References to fiscal year 2016 refer to the three month period ended
August 31, 2015. 

Sales  

Greystone s primary
focus is to provide quality plastic pallets to its existing customers while continuing its marketing efforts to broaden its customer
base. Greystone s existing customers are primarily located in the United States and engaged in the beverage, pharmaceutical
and other industries. Greystone has generated and plans to continue to generate interest in its pallets by attending trade shows
sponsored by industry segments that would benefit from Greystone s products. Greystone hopes to gain wider product acceptance
by marketing the concept that the widespread use of plastic pallets could greatly reduce the destruction of trees on a worldwide
basis. Greystone s marketing is conducted through contract distributors, its President and other employees. 

Greystone derives a substantial portion of
its revenue from two customers. One customer accounted for approximately 36% and 31% of Greystone s total sales in fiscal
year 2017 and 2016, respectively. The second customer accounted for 30% and -0-% of Greystone s total sales in fiscal years
2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Personnel  

Greystone had approximately
160 and 95 full-time employees as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Three Month Period Ended August 31,
2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2015   

Sales   

Sales for fiscal year
2017 were $7,844,261 compared to $5,569,981 in fiscal year 2016 for an increase of $2,274,280. Pallet sales were $7,657,259, or
98% of total sales, in fiscal year 2017 compared to $5,566,868, or 100% of total sales, in fiscal year 2016 for an increase of
$2,090,391. Other sales, principally tolling services, totaled $187,002 in fiscal year 2017 compared to $3,113 in fiscal year
2016. 

The increase in pallet
sales in fiscal year 2017 over 2016 is primarily due to the addition of a second major customer which is a pallet leasing company.
Pallet sales to Greystone s second major customer were 30% in fiscal year 2017 and -0- in fiscal year 2016. Greystone s
pallet sales to its other major customer were 36% of total sales in fiscal year 2017 compared to 31% in the prior year. Pallet
sales to Greystone s major customers are generally based on the customers  need to facilitate their pallet needs which
may vary by period. Greystone is not able to predict the future needs of these major customers and will continue its efforts to
grow sales through the addition of new customers developed through Greystone s marketing efforts. 

Cost of Sales   

Cost of sales in fiscal
year 2017 was $6,876,443, or 88% of sales, compared to $4,629,316, or 83% of sales, in fiscal year 2016. The increase in cost
of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2017 compared to 2016 is principally due to setup costs to fulfill the product
requirements of the pallet leasing company. 

Benefit from Income Taxes   

The benefit from income
taxes was $18,850 and $5,285 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The variation in the relationship of the benefit from
income taxes to income before taxes between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 resulted from the exclusion of the income from the variable
interest entity in the calculation of income taxes for Greystone. The taxable income from the variable interest entity is passed-through
to the owners of the entity. 

Based upon a review of
its income tax filing positions, Greystone believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit by the Internal Revenue
Service and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no
reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. 

Net Income   

Greystone recorded net
income of $27,008 in fiscal year 2017 compared to $48,396 in fiscal year 2016 primarily for the reasons discussed above. 

Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders   

Net loss attributable
to common stockholders for fiscal year 2017 was $(117,439), or $0.00 per share, compared to $(91,315), or $0.00 per share, in
fiscal year 2016 primarily for the reasons discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

A summary of cash flows
for the three months ended August 31, 2016 is as follows: 

The contractual obligations of Greystone are
as follows: 

Greystone had a working capital deficit of
$(907,377) at August 31, 2016. To provide for the funding to meet Greystone s operating activities and contractual obligations
as of August 31, 2016, Greystone will have to continue to produce positive operating results or explore various options including
additional long-term debt and equity financing. However, there is no guarantee that Greystone will continue to create positive
operating results or be able to raise sufficient capital to meet these obligations. 

As discussed in Note 5
to the consolidated financial statements, Greystone has loans with IBC which include a term loan with a maturity date of January
7, 2019 and a revolving loan which expires on January 31, 2018. The exact amount which can be borrowed under the revolving loan
from time to time is dependent upon the amount of the borrowing base, but can in no event exceed $2,500,000. 

Substantially all of the
financing that Greystone has received through the last few fiscal years resulted from loans provided by certain officers and directors
of Greystone and bank loans which are guaranteed by certain officers and directors of Greystone. 

Greystone continues to
be dependent upon its officers and directors to provide and/or secure additional financing and there is no assurance that its
officers and directors will continue to do so. As such, there is no assurance that funding will be available for Greystone to
continue operations. 

Greystone has 50,000 outstanding
shares of cumulative 2003 Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $5,000,000 and a preferred dividend rate of the prime
rate of interest plus 3.25%. Greystone does not anticipate that it will make cash dividend payments to any holders of its common
stock unless and until the financial position of Greystone improves through increased revenues, another financing transaction
or otherwise. Pursuant to the IBC Loan Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, Greystone may
pay dividends on its preferred stock in an amount not to exceed $500,000 per year. 

Forward Looking Statements and Material
Risks   

This Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q includes certain statements that may be deemed  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking
statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that Greystone
expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including decreased costs, securing financing, the profitability
of Greystone, potential sales of pallets or other possible business developments, are forward-looking statements. Such statements
are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q could be affected by any of the following factors: Greystone s prospects could be affected by changes in availability
of raw materials, competition, rapid technological change and new legislation regarding environmental matters; Greystone may not
be able to secure additional financing necessary to sustain and grow its operations; and a material portion of Greystone s
business is and will be dependent upon a few large customers and there is no assurance that Greystone will be able to retain such
customers. These risks and other risks that could affect Greystone s business are more fully described in Greystone s
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, which was filed on August 31, 2016. Actual results may vary materially from
the forward-looking statements. Greystone undertakes no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures.  

As of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Greystone carried out an evaluation under the supervision of Greystone s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Greystone s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on an evaluation as of May
31, 2016, Warren F. Kruger, Greystone s Chief Executive Officer, and William W. Rahhal, Greystone s Chief Financial
Officer, identified two material weaknesses in Greystone s internal control over financial reporting. As of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, such material weaknesses had not been rectified. As a result of the continuation
of these two material weaknesses, Greystone s CEO and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Greystone s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at August 31, 2016. 

During the three-month
period ended August 31, 2016, there were no changes in Greystone s internal controls over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, Greystone s internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 10.1   

AMENDED
AND RESTATED PROMISSORY NOTE  

  (Replacement
Note)  

FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned (jointly and severally and collectively referred to herein as the   Maker  )
hereby jointly and severally promise to pay to the order of ROBERT B. ROSENE, JR., his successors, heirs and assigns (the   Holder  )
the principal amount of Four Million Five Hundred Forty-One Thousand Six Hundred Ninety and No/100 Dollars ($4,541,690.00).  

  The
Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof from the date hereof until such principal amount is paid
in full, at the rate of Seven and One-half percent (7.5%) per annum.  

  This
Note shall be repaid as follows: Beginning July 1, 2016, and continuing monthly on or before the first business day of each month
thereafter, Maker shall make a payment in an amount necessary to pay all accrued, but unpaid, interest as of the last day of the
immediately preceding month (the  Minimum Monthly Payment ). Notwithstanding this Minimum Monthly Payment, Maker agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to make payments of no less than $41,666.67 per month (on the dates set forth above and
as allowed under that certain Loan Agreement dated January 31, 2014 among Greystone Logistics, Inc., Greystone Manufacturing,
L.L.C. and International Bank of Commerce) which such amount shall include the Minimum Monthly Payment. This payment shall be
applied first to all accrued, but unpaid, interest and secondly to the outstanding principal amount hereof. All outstanding principal
plus all accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable in full on January 15, 2018 (the   Maturity Date  ).
All payments of principal and interest shall be made to the Holder in Dollars in immediately available funds. Maker shall have
the right to prepay the outstanding principal balance of this Note, in full or in part, at any time without premium or penalty.  

  If
any amount is not paid in full when due hereunder, such unpaid amount shall bear interest, to be paid upon demand, from the due
date thereof until the date of actual payment (and before as well as after judgment) computed at a per annum rate of eighteen
percent (18%).  

  The
following shall constitute an   Event of Default   under this Note: (a) Maker s failure to pay when due
the Minimum Monthly Payment; (b) Maker shall be adjudged bankrupt, or any voluntary proceeding shall be instituted by Maker in
insolvency or bankruptcy, or for readjustment, extension or composition of debts or for any other relief of debtors, (c) any involuntary
proceeding shall be instituted against Maker in insolvency or for readjustment, extension, or composition of debts, which proceeding
is not dismissed within sixty (60) days from the filing of the commencement of the same, (d) Maker: (i) applies for or consents
to the appointment of a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the properties of Maker; (ii) admits in writing the inability to pay
debts as they mature; (iii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) has any part of his assets or property
placed in the hands of a receiver, trustee or other officers or representatives of a court or of creditors (unless the receiver,
trustee or other officer or representative is not dismissed within sixty (60) days), and (f) the death, dissolution, loss of capacity
or loss of legal existence of Maker. Upon the occurrence or existence of any Event of Default referenced in item (a) above for
which Holder intends to take legal action, Holder will give Maker written notice of such Event of Default and sixty (60) days
from the date of such notice to cure the Event of Default.  

Upon
the occurrence and continuation of one or more of the Events of Default beyond any applicable notice and cure period specified
above: (a) Holder may, at its option and without notice (such notice being expressly waived), declare the unpaid principal balance
of this Note and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon immediately due and payable, and/or (b) Holder may, at its option, exercise
any or all other rights and options available to Holder at law or in equity. Holder s rights, remedies and powers, as provided
in this Note are cumulative and concurrent, and may be pursued singly, successively or together against Maker, all at the sole
discretion of Holder. Additionally, Holder may resort to every other right or remedy available at law or in equity without first
exhausting the rights and remedies contained herein, all in Holder s sole discretion. Failure of Holder, for any period
of time or on more than one occasion, to exercise its option to accelerate the Maturity Date shall not constitute a waiver of
the right to exercise the same at any time during the continued existence of any Event of Default or any subsequent Event of Default.
If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or if collected through the probate court, bankruptcy court,
or by any other legal or judicial proceedings, Maker agrees and is obligated to pay, in addition to the sums referred to above,
the reasonable attorneys  fees of Holder, together with all court costs and other expenses paid by Holder.  

  Each
Maker, for itself, its successors and assigns, hereby waives diligence, presentment, protest and demand and notice of protest,
demand, dishonor and non-payment of this Note.  

  The
purpose and intent of this Amended and Restated Promissory Note is to extend, amend, and restate the outstanding principal balance
of that certain Promissory Note dated as of December 15, 2005 from the undersigned in favor of the Holder in the face amount of
$2,066,000.00 (the   Former Note  ). It is expressly not the intent hereof to pay off any portion of the Former
Note. The face amount hereof represents the outstanding principal balance of the Former Note plus accrued, but unpaid, interest
on the Former Note through the date hereof.  

    The
remainder of this page has been left intentionally blank.     

THIS NOTE SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
