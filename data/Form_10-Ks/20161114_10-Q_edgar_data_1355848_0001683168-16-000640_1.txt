Note 1: Organization and Business  

Organization and Nature of Business  

Genius Brands International, Inc. ( we ,
 us ,  our , or the  Company ) is a global content and brand management company that creates
and licenses multimedia content. Led by industry veterans, the Company distributes its content in all formats as well as a broad
range of consumer products based on its characters. In the children's media sector, the Company s portfolio features  content
with a purpose  for toddlers to tweens, which provides enrichment as well as entertainment, including tween music-driven brand  
SpacePop  ; preschool property debuting on Netflix  Llama Llama ; award-winning  Baby Genius , re-launched with new
entertainment and over 40 new products; adventure comedy  Thomas Edison's Secret Lab   , available on Netflix, public
broadcast stations and the Company s  Kid Genius  channel on Comcast's Xfinity on Demand; Warren Buffett's  
Secret Millionaires Club,  created with and starring iconic investor Warren Buffett. The Company is also co-producing an all-new
adult-themed animated series,  Stan Lee's Cosmic Crusaders , with Stan Lee's Pow! Entertainment and The Hollywood Reporter.  

In addition, the Company acts as licensing
agent for certain brands, leveraging its existing licensing infrastructure to expand these brands into new product categories,
new retailers, and new territories. These include  Llama Llama ;  From Frank , a humor greeting card and product line;
and  Celessence Technologies , the world's leading microencapsulation company. 

The Company commenced operations in January
2006, assuming all the rights and obligations of its then Chief Executive Officer, under an Asset Purchase Agreement between the
Company and Genius Products, Inc., in which the Company obtained all rights, copyrights, and trademarks to the brands  Baby
Genius,   Little Genius,   Kid Genius,   123 Favorite Music  and  Wee Worship, 
and all then existing productions under those titles. In October 2011, the Company (i) changed its domicile to Nevada from California,
and (ii) changed its name to Genius Brands International, Inc. from Pacific Entertainment Corporation (the  Reincorporation ).
In connection with the Reincorporation, the Company changed its trading symbol from  PENT  to  GNUS . 

On November 15, 2013, the Company entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Merger Agreement ) with A Squared Entertainment LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ( A Squared ), A Squared Holdings LLC, a California limited liability company and sole member
of A Squared (the  Parent Member ) and A2E Acquisition LLC, its newly formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary ( Acquisition
Sub ). Upon closing of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the  Merger ), which occurred
concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Acquisition Sub merged with and into A Squared, and A Squared, as the
surviving entity, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired the business
and operations of A Squared. 

On November 4, 2016, the Company filed
a certificate to change its Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse split on a 1-for-3 basis (the  2016 Reverse Split ).
The 2016 Reverse Split became effective on November 9, 2016. All common stock share and per share information in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ), including the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto,
have been adjusted to reflect retrospective application of the 2016 Reverse Split, unless otherwise indicated. 

Liquidity  

Historically, the Company has incurred
net losses. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $34,793,193 and total stockholders  equity
of $11,559,735. At September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets of $4,167,708, including cash of $3,642,667 and current liabilities
of $3,554,617, including certain trade payables of $925,000 to which the Company disputes the claim, resulting in working capital
of $613,091. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $1,530,900 and $797,820,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $4,363,567 and $2,421,938,
respectively, and reported net cash used by operating activities $1,885,328 and $2,611,607, respectively. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company received gross proceeds of $2,000,000 pursuant to its distribution agreement with Sony
Pictures Home Entertainment as well as $275,000 for the settlement of a distribution agreement. Additionally, on August 8,
2016, Llama Productions LLC ( Llama Productions ), a California limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, closed a $5,275,000 multiple draw-down, non-recourse, secured, non-revolving credit facility with
Bank Leumi USA for the production of its animated series  Llama Llama  (See Note 10, herein). While the Company believes
that its current cash balances and receivables combined with its production facility and deal pipeline will be sufficient to
fund operations for the next twelve months, there can be no assurance that cash flows from operations will continue to
improve in the near future. If the Company is unable to attain profitable operations and attain positive operating cash
flows, it may need to (i) seek additional funding, (ii) scale back its development or production plans, or (iii) reduce
certain operations. 

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

Our consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, include an immaterial revision to additional
paid in capital as well as retained earnings related to the beneficial conversion feature of certain preferred securities. The
effect of the revision was to increase additional paid in capital by $3,383,850 and to reduce retained earnings by the same amount
with no net effect to total stockholders  equity. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108 ( SAB 99  and  SAB 108 ), the Company has evaluated this error
and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, has determined that it was not material to any of the reporting
periods affected and no amendments to previously filed 10-Q or 10-K reports with the SEC are required. 

The following table summarizes impact of
these errors on the Company s consolidated financial statement, principally the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated
statement of operations as the errors and corrections are both non-cash items. All information has been adjusted for the 2016 Reverse
Split. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Genius Brands International, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries A Squared and Llama Productions
as well as its interest in Stan Lee Comics, LLC ( Stan Lee Comics ). All significant inter-company balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Business Combination  

On November 15, 2013, the Company entered
into a Merger Agreement with A Squared, the Member, and the Acquisition Sub. Upon closing of the Merger, which occurred concurrently
with entering into the Merger Agreement, our Acquisition Sub merged with and into A Squared, and A Squared, as the surviving entity,
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired the business and operations of
A Squared. 

The financial statements have been prepared
using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805 Business
Combinations. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

Financial Statement Reclassification  

Certain account balances from prior periods
have been reclassified in these consolidated financial statements to conform to current period classifications. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid
debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in Cash and Cash Equivalents
is $1,000,000 that the Company deposited into a cash account to be used solely for the production of its series  Llama Llama
 as a condition of its loan agreement with Bank Leumi. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

Accounts receivable are presented on the
balance sheets net of estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company assesses its accounts receivable balances on a quarterly basis
to determine collectability and records an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated
losses based on historical experience and future expectations. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance
when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $110,658
as of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost (average) or market and consist of finished goods such as DVDs, CDs and other products. A reserve for slow-moving and obsolete
inventory is established for all inventory deemed potentially non-saleable by management in the period in which it is determined
to be potentially non-saleable. The current inventory is considered properly valued and saleable. The Company concluded that there
was an appropriate reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory of $26,097 and $28,813 at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from two to seven years. Maintenance, repairs, and renewals, which neither materially add to the value of the
assets nor appreciably prolong their lives, are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses from any dispositions of property
and equipment are reflected in the statement of operations. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase
price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method. In accordance
with ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives
and are thus not amortized, but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The
Company completes the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests at the end of each fiscal year. To
test for goodwill impairment, we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units, of which we have
one. While we may use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing, our primary method is discounted cash
flows. We estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment
regarding the applicable discount rates. Changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate
of the fair market value of the reporting units, which could result in an impairment of goodwill of indefinite lived intangible
assets in future periods. 

Other intangible assets have been acquired,
either individually or with a group of other assets, and were initially recognized and measured based on fair value. In accordance
with ASC 350 Intangible Assets, the costs of new product development and significant improvement to existing products are capitalized
while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. Annual amortization of these intangible assets
is computed based on the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the asset. 

Film and Television Costs  

The Company capitalizes production costs
for episodic series produced in accordance with ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production
costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue based on the initial market revenue evidenced by a firm commitment
over the period of commitment. The Company expenses all capitalized costs that exceed the initial market firm commitment revenue
in the period of delivery of the episodes. 

The Company capitalizes production costs
for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs
are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value
of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates its capitalized production costs annually and limits
recorded amounts by their ability to recover such costs through expected future sales. 

Additionally, the Company develops new
videos, music, books and digital applications in addition to adding content, improved animation and bonus songs/features to its
existing product catalog. After the initial release of the film or episodic series, the costs of significant improvement to existing
products are capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with ASC 926-605 Entertainment-Films - Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence
of a sale with a customer exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered or is available for delivery, (iii) the license
period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition, or sale, (iv) the arrangement fee
is fixed or determinable, and (v) collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured. 

The Company s licensing and royalty
revenue represents revenue generated from license agreements that are held in conjunction with third parties that are responsible
for collecting fees due and remitting to the Company its share after expenses. Revenue from licensed products is recognized when
realized or realizable based on royalty reporting received from licensees. Licensing income the Company recognizes as an agent
is in accordance with ASC 605-45 Revenue Recognition - Principal Agent. Accordingly, the Company s revenue is its gross billings
to its customers less the amounts it pays to suppliers for their products and services. 

The Company recognizes revenue related
to product sales when (i) the seller s price is substantially fixed, (ii) shipment has occurred causing the buyer to be obligated
to pay for product, (iii) the buyer has economic substance apart from the seller, and (iv) there is no significant obligation for
future performance to directly bring about the resale of the product by the buyer as required by ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. 

Stock Based Compensation  

As required by ASC 718 - Stock Compensation,
the Company recognizes an expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, using
the Black-Scholes calculation as of the date of grant. 

Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per common share
( EPS ) is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus the assumed exercise of all dilutive securities
using the treasury stock or  as converted  method, as appropriate. During periods of net loss, all common stock equivalents
are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because they are antidilutive. 

Income Taxes  

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted
tax rates. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other
possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets
to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not
will be realized. 

Fair value of financial instruments  

The carrying amounts of cash, receivables
and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. 

We adopted ASC 820 as of January 1, 2008
for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and  

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 affects
any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer
of non-financial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g. insurance contracts). This ASU will
supersede all revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific guidance throughout the
industry topics of the codification. The guidance's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue principles, an entity will identify the contract(s) with a customer,
identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
and recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied (either over time or at a point in time). The ASU further states
that an entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which approved a one-year deferral
of the effective date of the ASU from the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
to annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, with an option for early adoption
of the standard on the original effective date. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which clarified
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , that amended the revenue guidance
on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11
 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 805): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting
Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , which rescinded
from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification certain SEC paragraphs as a result of two SEC Staff Announcements. The FASB also
issued ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ,
which clarified guidance on assessment of collectability, presentation of sale taxes, measurement of noncash consideration, and
certain transition matters. The Company is still evaluating the impact that the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and related subsequent
updates will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In
April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015 -3,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. We adopted this standard during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases . The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise
from leases on the balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease
payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. 
The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments
should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application
permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact
of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation    ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies
the accounting and reporting of certain aspects of shared-based payment transactions, including income tax treatment of excess
tax benefits, forfeitures, classification of share-based awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the statement
of cash flows for certain share-based transactions related to tax benefits and tax payments. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public
business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods; early
adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial
statements. 

Various other accounting pronouncements
have been recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific
industries, and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Note 3: Inventory  

During the second quarter of 2014, the
Company began a strategic initiative to restructure its product sales business by phasing out the direct sale of physical products
including DVDs and CDs and shifting to a licensing model. In addition to nominal changes to the reserve made during the normal
course of business, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company determined that a portion of its inventory may not be saleable
and recorded an additional reserve of $174,963 which was recorded as a loss on inventory. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company had recorded a total reserve of $26,097 and $28,813, respectively.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
net Film and Television Costs of $1,602,236 compared to $1,003,546 at December 31, 2015. The increase relates primarily to the
production and development of  SpacePop, Llama Llama, and Stan Lee s Cosmic Crusaders  offset by the amortization of
film costs associated with the revenue recognized for  Thomas Edison s Secret Lab.  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded Film and Television Cost amortization expense of $23,011 and $42,642, respectively. During

 Llama Llama  production. 

Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible
Assets, Net  

Goodwill  

In association with the Merger, the Company
recognized $10,365,805 in Goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration for the Merger over net identifiable
assets acquired. Pursuant to ASC 350-20, Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to annual review to determine if
certain events warrant impairment to the Goodwill asset. Through September 30, 2016, the Company has not recognized any impairment
to Goodwill. 

Intangible Assets, Net  

The Company had the following intangible
assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(a) 
     In association with the Merger, the Company acquired $1,740,000 of Identifiable Artistic-Related Assets. These assets, related to certain properties owned by A Squared and assumed by the Company, were valued using an independent firm during the fourth quarter of 2013. Based on certain legal, regulatory, contractual, and economic factors, the Company has deemed these assets to be indefinite-lived. Hence, pursuant to ASC 350-30, these assets are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Through September 30, 2016, the Company has not recognized any impairment expense related to these assets.  

(b) 
     Pursuant to ASC 350-30-35, the Company reviews these intangible assets periodically to determine if the value should be retired or impaired due to recent events. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not recognize any impairment of these assets.  

(c) 
     During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $19,448 and $19,999, respectively, in amortization expense related to the Trademarks, Product Masters, and Other Intangible Assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $57,763 and $50,322, respectively, in amortization expense related to the Trademarks, Product Masters, and Other Intangible Assets.  

Expected future intangible asset amortization as of September
30, 2016 is as follows: 

Note 7: Deferred Revenue  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company had total deferred revenue of $3,118,730 and 958,539, respectively. Deferred revenue includes both (i) variable
fee contracts with licensees and customers in which the Company had collected advances and minimum guarantees against future royalties
and (ii) fixed fee contracts. The Company recognizes revenue related to these contracts when all revenue recognition criteria have
been met. 

Note 8: Accrued Liabilities - Current  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company has the following accrued liabilities: 

(a) 
     Accrued Salaries and Wages represent accrued vacation payable to employees.  

(b) 
     As part of the Merger, the Company assumed certain liabilities from a previous member of A Squared which has claimed certain liabilities totaling $925,000. The Company disputes the basis for this liability. As of September 30, 2016, the Company believes that the statute of limitations applicable to the assertion of any legal claim relating to the collection of these liabilities has expired and therefore believes this liability is uncollectible. The Company is working with the counterparty to extinguish this liability.  

(c) 
     During the first quarter of 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive three-year agreement with Sony DADC, the optical disc manufacturing and fulfillment arm of Sony, to provide all CD, DVD and BD replication, packaging and distribution to the Company s direct customers. Under the terms of the long-term, exclusive supply chain services agreement, the Company will order a minimum level of disc replication, packaging and distribution services for its content across all physical media, including DVD, CD, and Blu-ray from Sony DADC. As consideration for these minimum order levels, the Company received a total of $1,500,000, $750,000 during the first quarter of 2014 and $750,000 during the first quarter of 2015. At the end of the term, the Company is obligated to repay a pro-rata portion of the advance if it has not ordered a minimum number of DVD/CD units during the term.  

Note 9: Short Term Debt - Related Parties  

As part of the Merger, the Company acquired
certain liabilities from A Squared. From time to time, A Squared required short-term advances to fund its operations and provide
working capital from its founder, the Company s current Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Heyward. As of December 31, 2015,
these advances totaled $410,535. On May 4, 2016, the Company issued to Mr. Heyward 79,561 shares of common stock valued at $5.16
per share, the day s closing stock price, in full payment and satisfaction of these advances. 

These advances were interest free and had
no stated maturity. The Company applied an imputed interest rate of 6% in accordance with ASC 835-30-45. During three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized imputed interest expense of $0 and $6,229 as a contribution to additional paid-in
capital, respectively. During nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized imputed interest expense of
$6,141 and $18,544 as a contribution to additional paid-in capital, respectively. 

Note 10: Production Facility  

On August 8, 2016, Llama Productions
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed a $5,275,000 multiple draw-down, secured, non-recourse, non-revolving
credit facility (the  Facility ) with Bank Leumi USA for the production of its animated series  Llama
Llama , (the  Series ) which is configured as fifteen half-hour episodes comprised of thirty 11 minute
programs to be delivered to Netflix in fall 2017. The Facility is secured by the license fees the Company will receive from
Netflix for the delivery of the Series as well as the Company s copyright in the Series. The Facility has a term of 40
months and has an interest rate of either Prime plus 1% or one, three, or six month LIBOR plus 3.25%. As a condition of the
loan agreement with Bank Leumi, the Company deposited $1,000,000 into a cash account to be used solely for the production of
the Series. Additionally, the Facility contains certain standard affirmative and negative non-financial covenants such as
maintaining certain levels of production insurance and providing standard financial reports. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
gross outstanding borrowing under the facility of $385,971 against which offering costs of $146,316 were applied resulting in net

Note 11: Stockholders  Equity  

Common Stock  

As of September 30, 2016, the total
number of authorized shares of common stock was 233,333,334. 

On April 2, 2014, we filed a certificate
of change to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse split on a 1-for-100 basis (the  2014 Reverse Split. ).
The 2014 Reverse Split was effective with FINRA on April 7, 2014. All common stock share and per share information in this Form
10-Q, including the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, have been adjusted to reflect application
of the 2014 Reverse Split, unless otherwise indicated. The total number of authorized shares of common stock was not adjusted in
conjunction with the 2014 Reverse Split. 

On October 29, 2015, the Company conducted
a private placement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which it sold an aggregate of 1,443,334 shares of its common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,443,334 shares of common stock for a purchase
price of $3.00 per share and associated warrant for gross proceeds of $4,330,000 (the  2015 Private Placement ). The
2015 Private Placement closed on November 3, 2015. Stock offering costs were $502,218. (See Note 13 for additional information
about these warrants.) 

On October 6, 2016, the Board of Directors
of the Company authorized a reverse stock split in preparation for the Company s anticipated uplisting on the NASDAQ Capital
Market. 

On November 4, 2016, the Company filed
a certificate of change to the Company s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to
effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse
stock split, every three shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined and reclassified
into one share of the Company s common stock. The reverse stock split affected all issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, as well as common stock underlying stock options and warrants outstanding. No fractional shares will be issued in connection
with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of common stock will receive an increase
to their common stock as the common stock will be rounded up to a full share. The total number of authorized shares of common stock
was reduced from 700,000,000 to 233,333,334 in conjunction with the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split became effective
on November 9, 2016. All disclosures of shares and per share data in these consolidated financial statements and related notes
have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were 3,990,211 and 3,753,150 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. Below are the changes to the Company s
common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

On various dates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 111,667 shares of the Company s common stock as a conversion of 335 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  

On March 12, 2016, the Company issued 10,000 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $2.40 per share as part of a settlement agreement with an entity that had provided music production services to the Company.  

On May 4, 2016, the Company issued to Mr. Heyward 79,561 shares of common stock valued at $5.16 per share, the day s closing stock price, in satisfaction of certain short term advances.  

Preferred Stock  

The Company has 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share. The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed
by law, without further vote or action by our stockholders, to issue from time to time shares of preferred stock in one or more
series. Each series of preferred stock will have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications
and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by our Board of Directors, which may include, among others,
dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were 4,955 and 5,290 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, respectively. 

On May 12, 2014, the Board of Directors
authorized the designation of a class of preferred stock as  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock . On May 14, 2014,
the Company filed the Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of the 0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the
Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. 

Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock
is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, based on a conversion calculation equal
to the Base Amount divided by the conversion price. The Base Amount is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate stated value of
the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted and (ii) all unpaid dividends thereon. The stated value of each share of the Series
A Preferred Stock is $1,000 and the initial conversion price is $6.00 per share, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits,
dividends and recapitalizations. Additionally, in the event the Company issues shares of its common stock or common stock equivalents
at a per share price that is lower than the conversion price then in effect, the conversion price shall be adjusted to such lower
price, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is prohibited from effecting a conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to
the extent that as a result of such conversion, the investor would beneficially own more than 9.99% in the aggregate of the issued
and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, calculated immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares
of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock possess no voting rights. 

On May 14, 2014, we entered into securities
purchase agreements with certain accredited investors pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 6,000 shares of our then newly
designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share for gross proceeds to us of $6,000,000. Related
to the sale, we incurred offering costs of $620,085 resulting in net proceeds of $5,379,915. The transaction closed on May 15,
2014. 

As the conversion price of the Series A
Preferred Stock on a converted basis was below the market price of the common shares on the closing date, this resulted in a beneficial
conversion feature recorded as an  imputed  dividend of $2,010,000. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015,
in connection with the 2015 Private Placement in which the Company s common stock was sold at $3.00 per share, the conversion
price of the Series A Preferred Stock decreased to $3.00. This decrease resulted in an additional beneficial conversion feature
of $3,383,850 which has now been recognized as of the time of the 2015 Private Placement as opposed to at the time of each investor s
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock. (See Basis of Presentation in Note 2, herein). 

Note 12: Stock Options  

The Company has adopted the provisions
of ASC 718 - Compensation which requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments
based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period
during which the awards are expected to vest. 

On December 29, 2008, the Company adopted
the 2008 Stock Option Plan (the  Plan ), which provides for the issuance of qualified and non-qualified stock options
to officers, directors, employees and other qualified persons. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company
or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The number of shares of the Company s common stock initially reserved
for issuance under the Plan was 36,667. On September 2, 2011, the stockholders holding a majority of the Company s outstanding
common stock adopted an amendment to the Company s 2008 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock
issuable under the plan to 166,667. 

On September 18, 2015, the Company adopted
the Genius Brands International, Inc. 2015 Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ). The 2015 Plan was approved by our stockholders
in September 2015. The 2015 Plan as approved by the stockholders authorized the issuance up to an aggregate of 150,000 shares of
common stock. On December 14, 2015, the Board of Directors voted to amend the 2015 Plan to increase the total number of shares
that can be issued under the 2015 Plan by 1,293,334 from 150,000 shares to 1,443,334 shares. The increase in shares available for
issuance under the 2015 Plan was approved by stockholders on February 3, 2016. 

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s
stock option plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company granted options to purchase 1,407,736 shares of common stock to officers, directors, employees, and consultants. These
stock options generally vest between one and three years, while a portion vested upon grant. The fair value of these options was
determined to be $2,402,395 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: 

During the three months ended March 31,
2016, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $564,985. The expense recognized reflects revisions to (i) align
with the graded vesting of the majority of the options granted in 2015, (ii) make adjustments in certain accounting estimates utilized
in the Black Scholes model, and (iii) reflect the accurate number of options granted in 2015. As such, included in the total stock
based compensation expense recognized in this first quarter of 2016 is $220,564 of true-up expenses from prior periods. The Company
has assessed these adjustments individually and in aggregate and considers them immaterial to the current and prior periods. 

During the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $358,919 and $1,236,880 in stock compensation expense, respectively. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not recognize any stock based compensation expense.

common stock. These warrants are exercisable immediately, have an exercise price of $6.00 per share, and have a five-year term. 

On October 29, 2015, the Company entered
into securities purchase agreements with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 1,443,334
shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,443,334 shares of common
stock for a purchase price of $3.00 per share and the associated warrants for gross proceeds to the Company of $4,330,000 (the
 2015 Private Placement ). The closing of the 2015 Private Placement occurred on November 3, 2015. The warrants are
exercisable into shares of common stock for a period of five (5) years from issuance at an initial exercise price of $3.30 per
share, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, dividends and recapitalizations. The warrants are exercisable immediately.
The Company is prohibited from effecting an exercise of the warrants to the extent that as a result of such exercise, the holder
would beneficially own more than 4.99% (subject to increase up to 9.99% upon 61 days  notice) in the aggregate of the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock, calculated immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon
exercise of the warrant.

in the Company s outstanding warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Note 14: Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted
tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  A
valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 

ASC 740 provides guidance on the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements. ASC 740 requires a company to determine whether
it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position.  If
the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the
financial statements. 

At the adoption date of January 1, 2008,
the Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. 

The Company includes interest and penalties
arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Pursuant to FASB ASC 855, Management has
evaluated all events and transactions that occurred from September 30, 2016 through the date of issuance of these financial statements.
During this period, we did not have any significant subsequent events, except as disclosed below: 

On
                                         October 6, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a reverse stock split
                                         in preparation for the Company s anticipated uplisting on the NASDAQ Capital Market.

On
                                         November 4, 2016, the Company filed a certificate of change to the Company s Articles
                                         of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-3 reverse
                                         stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of
                                         the reverse stock split, every three shares of the Company s issued and outstanding
                                         common stock were automatically combined and reclassified into one share of the Company s
                                         common stock. The reverse stock split affected all issued and outstanding shares of common
                                         stock, as well as common stock underlying stock options and warrants outstanding. No
                                         fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders
                                         who would otherwise hold a fractional share of common stock will receive an increase
                                         to their common stock as the common stock will be rounded up to a full share. The total
                                         number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced from 700,000,000 to 233,333,334
                                         in conjunction with the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split became effective
                                         on November 9, 2016. All disclosures of shares and per share data in these consolidated
                                         financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the
                                         reverse stock split for all periods presented.   

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The following discussion and analysis
of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
financial statements and related notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Certain statements made or incorporated
by reference in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in statements
made by or with the approval of authorized personnel constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. Forward looking statements reflect intent, belief, current expectations, estimates
or projections about, among other things, our industry, management s beliefs, and future events and financial trends affecting
us. Words such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   believes, 
 seeks,   estimates,   may,   will  and variations of these words or similar expressions
are intended to identify forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward looking statements. Although
we believe the expectations reflected in any forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual
results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors.
These differences can arise as a result of the risks described in the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 30, 2016 and elsewhere in this report, as well
as other factors that may affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Forward looking statements in this
report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of
the date of those documents. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties,
we cannot assure you that the forward looking statements contained in this report will, in fact, transpire.  

Overview  

The management s discussion and analysis
is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and
conditions. 

Our Business  

We are a global content and brand management
company that creates and licenses multimedia content. Led by industry veterans, we distribute our content in all formats as well

On November 4, 2016, the Company filed
an amendment to it Articles of Incorporation to affect a reverse split on a 1-for-3 (the  2016 Reverse Split ). The
2016 Reverse Split was effective with FINRA on November 9, 2016. All common stock share and per share information in this Form
10-Q, including the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, have been adjusted to reflect retrospective
application of the 2016 Reverse Split, unless otherwise indicated. The total number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced
from 700,000,000 to 233,333,334 in conjunction with the 2016 Reverse Split. 

Our Products  

Original Content   

We own and produce original content for
which there is generally a three-year cycle from the inception of an idea, through production of the content and development and
distribution of a range of consumer products to retail, creating an inevitable lag time between the creation of the intellectual
property to the realization of economic benefit of those assets. The goal is to maintain a robust and diverse portfolio of brands,
appealing to various interests and ages, featuring evergreen topics with global appeal. Our portfolio of intellectual property
can be licensed, re-licensed, and exploited for years to come, with revenue derived from multiple sources and territories. In
many cases, a significant portion of our production costs are covered through either pre-sales or financings.

Revenue.    

Licensing and royalty revenue includes
items for which we license the rights to our copyrights and trademarks of our brands and those of the brands for which we act as
a licensing agent. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015, this category decreased modestly
by $12,375 (13%) due the transition from one distribution partner to another. 

Television   Home Entertainment revenue
is generated from distribution of our properties for broadcast on television, VOD, or SVOD in domestic and foreign markets and
the sale of DVDs for home entertainment. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Television   Home Entertainment
revenue decreased $147,889 (81%) compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing the commencement of deliveries
of  Thomas Edison s Secret Lab  in the third quarter of 2015 with fewer deliveries in the current quarter. 

Cost of Sales and Operating Costs.     

Cost of Sales decreased $1,918 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of certain non-capitalizable
expenses associated with the release of  Thomas Edison s Secret Lab . Similarly, amortization of Film and TV costs decreased
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period as a result of the amortization of film costs commensurate
with decreased revenue associated with  Thomas Edison s Secret Lab.  

General and Administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries,
employee benefits, as well as other expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, marketing, rent, other professional services,
and depreciation and amortization. General and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $511,013
(58%) compared to the same period in 2015. Of this increase, $358,919 was attributable to stock based compensation for options
granted to officers, directors, employees, and consultants in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Marketing and sales expenses increased
$129,369 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to expenses

income and expense such as interest expense and the gain or loss on certain transactions as well as unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments related to certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. For the three months ended September 30,
2016, other income totaled $2,821 compared to a loss of $43,196 in the prior period. This $46,017 improvement related to the lack
of a loss on distribution contracts in the current period.

are manufactured and sold by us either directly at wholesale to retail stores or online retailers. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, product sales increased by $977 (6%) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to direct product
sales of Warren Buffet s  Secret Millionaires Club  at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders  meeting offset
by diminishing direct sales in the first quarter due to the exit from the direct sales business. 

Cost of Sales and Operating
Costs.   

Cost of Sales increased $48,821 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily the result of certain

direct sales of Warren Buffet s  Secret Millionaires Club  at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders  meeting .
 Similarly, amortization of Film and TV costs increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior
period as a result of the amortization of film costs associated with   the release of  Thomas Edison s Secret Lab

income and expense such as interest expense and the gain or loss on certain transactions as well as unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments related to certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
other loss totaled $252,690 compared to $52,988 in the prior period. This $199,702 increase was primarily due to the $275,000 settlement
of a distribution agreement with limited comparable activity in the prior period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Working Capital   

At September 30, 2016, we had current assets

facility (the  Facility ) with Bank Leumi USA for the production of our animated series  Llama Llama  (the
 Series ). The Series is configured as fifteen half-hour episodes comprised of thirty 11 minute programs to be

Comparison of Cash Flows for the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Cash totaled $3,642,667 at September 30, 2016 and $2,147,931
at September 30, 2015. The change in cash during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, our primary source of cash was financing activity proceeds from the exercise of warrants as well as proceeds from the
 Llama  production facility. During the comparable period in 2015, our primary source of cash was financing activity including
the collection of the second payment related to a long-term, exclusive supply chain services contract. During both periods, these
funds were primarily used to fund operations. 

Operating Activities  

Cash used in operating activities in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,885,328 as compared to a use of $2,611,607 during the prior period, representing an
improvement in the cash used by operating activities of $726,279 based on the operating results discussed above as well as the
receipt of the advance from Sony offset by film and television costs related to the development and production of  SpacePop,
Llama Llama,   Rainbow Rangers , and  Stan Lee s Cosmic Crusaders.  

Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,192 as compared to a use of $292,074 for the comparable period in 2015, representing
a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $284,882. This decrease is primarily the result of approximately $180,000 spent
on leasehold improvements in our leased office space in the first quarter of 2015 and as well as the development expenditures for
certain intangible assets without comparable activity in 2016. 

Financing Activities

during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $347,267 as compared to $750,513 generated in the comparable period in 2015
representing a decrease of $402,946. During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a long-term, exclusive supply chain services
agreement in which we will order a minimum level of disc replication, packaging and distribution services for our content across
all physical media. As consideration for these minimum order levels, we received a total of $1,500,000, $750,000 during the first
quarter of 2014 and $750,000 during the first quarter of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash generated
from financing activities related to $110,000 received from the exercise of certain outstanding warrants as well as draw-downs
on the  Llama  production facility. 

Capital Expenditures   

As of September 30, 2016, we do not have
any material commitments for capital expenditures. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our accounting policies are described in
the notes to the financial statements. Below is a summary of the critical accounting policies, among others, that management believes
involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation  

Our consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Genius Brands International, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries A Squared Entertainment, LLC and Llama Productions
LLC as well as our interest in Stan Lee Comics, LLC. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase
price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method. In accordance
with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful
lives and are thus not amortized, but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise.
We complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests during the fourth quarter. To test for goodwill
impairment, we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units. While we may use a variety of methods
to estimate fair value for impairment testing, our primary methods are discounted cash flows. We estimate future cash flows and
allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates.
Changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting
units, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. 

Other intangible assets have been acquired,
either individually or with a group of other assets, and were initially recognized and measured based on fair value. In accordance
with ASC 350 Intangible Assets, the costs of new product development and significant improvement to existing products are capitalized
while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. Annual amortization of these intangible assets
is computed based on the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the asset. 

Film and Television Costs  

We capitalize production costs for episodic
series produced in accordance with ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are
capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue based on the initial market revenue evidenced by a firm commitment
over the period of commitment. We expense all capitalized costs that exceed the initial market firm commitment revenue in the period
of delivery of the episodes. 

We capitalize production costs for films
produced in accordance with ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized
at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s)
delivered and recognized as revenue. We evaluate our capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by their
ability to recover such costs through expected future sales. 

Additionally, we develop new videos, music,
books and digital applications in addition to adding content, improved animation and bonus songs/features to our existing product
catalog. After the initial release of the film or episodic series, the costs of significant improvement to existing products are
capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize revenue in accordance with
ASC 926-605 Entertainment-Films - Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a sale
with a customer exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered or is available for delivery, (iii) the license period
of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition, or sale, (iv) the arrangement fee is fixed
or determinable, and (v) collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured. 

Our licensing and royalty revenue represents
revenue generated from license agreements that are held in conjunction with third parties that are responsible for collecting fees
due and remitting to us its share after expenses. Revenue from licensed products is recognized when realized or realizable based
on royalty reporting received from licensees. Licensing income we recognize as an agent is in accordance with ASC 605-45 Revenue
Recognition - Principal Agent. Accordingly, our revenue is our gross billings to our customers less the amounts we pay to suppliers
for their products and services. 

We recognize revenue related to product
sales when (i) the seller s price is substantially fixed, (ii) shipment has occurred causing the buyer to be obligated to
pay for product, (iii) the buyer has economic substance apart from the seller, and (iv) there is no significant obligation for
future performance to directly bring about the resale of the product by the buyer as required by ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. 

Other Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK.   

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  ). Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the period ended September 30, 2016, in ensuring
that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls  

Internal control over financial reporting
cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the
possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control
system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

As of September 30, 2016, there were no
material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings
are known to us to be threatened or contemplated against us. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   

There have been no changes to the Risk
Factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

ARTICLE VII  

INDEMNITY  

Every person who was or is a party to, or
is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, or a person of whom he is the legal representative, is or was
a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall be
indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent legally permissible under the laws of the State of Nevada from time to
time against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by him in connection therewith. Such right of indemnification shall be a contract
right which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding must be paid by the Corporation as they are incurred and in advance
of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or
officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation. Such right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such directors,
officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire, and, without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall
be entitled to their respective rights of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders, provision of law,
or otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article. 

Without limiting the application of the foregoing,
the board of directors may adopt bylaws from time to time with respect to indemnification, to provide at all times the fullest
indemnification permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada, and may cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as director or officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprises
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred in any such capacity or arising out of such status, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person. 

The indemnification provided in this Article
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS,
PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF THE  

  0% SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF  

  GENIUS BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, INC.  

I, Andrew
Heyward, hereby certify that I am the Chief Executive Officer of Genius Brands International, Inc. (the   Company ),
 a corporation organized and existing under the Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statues (the   Nevada General Company
Law   or the   NGCL ),  and further do hereby certify: 

That pursuant
to the authority expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the   Board )  by the Company's
Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the   Articles of Incorporation ),  the Board on May 14, 2014 adopted the
following resolutions creating a series of shares of Preferred Stock designated as 0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, none
of which shares have been issued: 

RESOLVED, that the Board designates the
0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such series, and fixes the rights, powers, preferences,
privileges and restrictions relating to such series in addition to any set forth in the Articles of Incorporation as follows: 

TERMS OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  

1.               Designation and Number of Shares.  There shall hereby be created and established a series of preferred stock of the
Company designated as  0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock  (the   Preferred Shares ).  The authorized
number of Preferred Shares shall be 6,000 shares. Each Preferred Share shall have $0.001 par value. Capitalized terms not defined
herein shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 23 below. 

2.               Ranking. 
Except to the extent that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares (the   Required
Holders )  expressly consent to the creation of Parity Stock (as defined below) or Senior Preferred Stock (as
defined below) in accordance with Section 12, all shares of capital stock of the Company shall be junior in rank to all
Preferred Shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation,
dissolution and winding up of the Company (such junior stock is referred to herein collectively as   Junior
Stock ).  The rights of all such shares of capital stock of the Company shall be subject to the rights, powers,
preferences and privileges of the Preferred Shares. Without limiting any other provision of this Certificate of Designations,
without the prior express consent of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, the Company shall not hereafter
authorize or issue any additional or other shares of capital stock that is (i) of senior rank to the Preferred Shares in
respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of
the Company (collectively, the   Senior Preferred Stock ),  (ii) of pari passu rank to the Preferred Shares in
respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of
the Company (collectively, the   Parity Stock )  or (iii) any Junior Stock having a maturity date (or any
other date requiring redemption or repayment of such shares of Junior Stock) that is prior to the date no Preferred Shares
remain outstanding. In the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, the
Preferred Shares shall maintain their relative rights, powers, designations, privileges and preferences provided for herein
and no such merger or consolidation shall result inconsistent therewith. 

3.               Dividends.  In addition to Sections 5(a) and 11 below, from and after the first date of issuance of any Preferred
Shares (the   Initial Issuance Date ),  each holder of a Preferred Share (each, a   Holder   and
collectively, the   Holders )  shall be entitled to receive dividends  ( Dividends )  when and as
declared by the Board, from time to time, in its sole discretion, which Dividends shall be paid by the Company out of funds legally
available therefor, payable, subject to the conditions and other terms hereof, in cash on the Stated Value of such Preferred Share. 

4.               Conversion.  Each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock (as defined below) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4. 

(a)               Holder's
Conversion Right.  Subject to the provisions of Section 4(e), at any time or times on or after the Initial Issuance Date,
each Holder shall be entitled to convert any whole number of Preferred Shares into validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). 

(b)               Conversion
Rate.  The number of validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each
Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be determined according to the following formula (the   Conversion Rate ):   

Base Amount  
Conversion Price 

No
fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares. If the issuance would result
in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up
to the nearest whole share. 

(c)               Mechanics
of Conversion.  The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 

(i)             Holder's
Conversion.  To convert a Preferred Share into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock on any
date (a   Conversion Date ),  a Holder shall deliver (whether via facsimile or otherwise), for receipt on or prior
to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the share(s) of Preferred Shares subject
to such conversion in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit I   (the   Conversion Notice )  to the Company.
If required by Section 4(c)(vi), within five (5) Trading Days following a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid,
such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company the original certificates
representing the share(s) of Preferred Shares (the   Preferred Share Certificates )  so converted as aforesaid. 

(ii)            Company's
Response.  On or before the first (1 st ) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company
shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation, in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit II,   of receipt
of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer
Agent to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the second (2 nd ) Trading
Day following the date of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice, the Company shall (1) provided that the Transfer Agent
is participating in DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to
which such Holder shall be entitled to such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal
at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program,
issue and deliver (via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered
in the name of such Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled. If
the number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section
4(c)(vi) is greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall if requested by such Holder, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and
at its own expense, issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a new Preferred Share Certificate representing the number
of Preferred Shares not converted. 

(iii)           Record
Holder.  The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. 

(iv)               Company's
Failure to Timely Convert.  If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, to issue to a Holder within three (3)
Trading Days after the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via facsimile or otherwise) (the   Share Delivery
Deadline ),  a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled and register such
shares of Common Stock on the Company's share register or to credit such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC for
such number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of any Preferred Shares (as
the case may be) (a   Conversion Failure ),  then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder,
such Holder, upon written notice to the Company, (x) may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned
(as the case may be) any Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Holder's Conversion Notice, provided that
the voiding of a Conversion Notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to
the date of such notice pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations or otherwise and (y) the Company shall pay in
cash to such Holder on each day after such third (3r d ) Trading Day that the issuance of such shares of Common Stock
is not timely effected an amount equal to 1.5% of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock not issued
to such Holder on a timely basis and to which the Holder is entitled and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the last possible date on which the Company could have issued such shares of Common Stock to
the Holder without violating Section 4(c). In addition to the foregoing, if within three (3) Trading Days after the Company's
receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via facsimile or otherwise), the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate
to such Holder and register such shares of Common Stock on the Company's share register or credit such Holder's or its designee's
balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion
hereunder (as the case may be), and if on or after such third (3r d ) Trading Day such Holder (or any other Person in
respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, or a sale of a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, issuable upon such conversion that
such Holder so anticipated receiving from the Company, then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company
shall, within three (3) Business Days after such Holder's request and in such Holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to such
Holder in an amount equal to such Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses,
if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including, without limitation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf,
of such Holder) (the   Buy-In Price ),  at which point the Company's obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate
or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon
such Holder's conversion hereunder (as the case may be) (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly
honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock
or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon
such Holder's conversion hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any)
of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price
of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending
on the date of such issuance and payment under this clause (ii). 

(v)             Pro
Rata Conversion; Disputes.  In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion
Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder's Preferred Shares
submitted for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder
relative to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. 

In
the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred
Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in
accordance with Section 22. 

(vi)            Book-Entry.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, upon conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof, no Holder thereof shall be required to physically surrender the certificate representing the Preferred
Shares to the Company following conversion thereof unless (A) the full or remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by
the certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this
Section 4(c)(vi)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion
Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of any Preferred Shares. Each Holder and the Company
shall maintain records showing the number of Preferred Shares so converted by such Holder and the dates of such conversions or
shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of
the certificate representing the Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such
records of such Holder establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred
Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each certificate
for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend: 

ANY TRANSFEREE OR
ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION'S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO
THE SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(vi) THEREOF. THE NUMBER OF
SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES A
PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(vi) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE
SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

(d)               Taxes.  The
Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp, transfer (but only in respect of the registered holder thereof), issuance
and other similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of Preferred Shares. 

(e)               Limitation
on Beneficial Ownership.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Designations, the
Preferred Shares held by a Holder shall not be convertible by such Holder, and the Company shall not effect any conversion of
any Preferred Shares held by such Holder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Holder or any of its affiliates
would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the   Maximum Percentage )  of the Common Stock. To the extent the
above limitation applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Shares held by such Holder shall be convertible
(vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by ;such Holder or any of its affiliates)
and of which such securities shall be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by such
Holder and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first
submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability of a Holder to
convert Preferred Shares, or of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock to such Holder, pursuant to this Section 4(e)
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section 4(e) with respect to any subsequent
determination of convertibility or issuance (as the case may be). For purposes of this Section 4(e), beneficial ownership and
all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership)
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The provisions of this Section 4(e) shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of
this Section 4(e) to correct this Section 4(e) (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with
the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary
or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section 4(e)
shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Shares. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 4(e) and the Company may not waive this Section 4(e) without the consent of holders of a majority of its Common
Stock. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business
Day confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue
of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without
limitation, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or securities issued pursuant to the Exchange Agreements. By written
notice to the Company, any Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of
9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such
notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder sending such notice
and not to any other Holder. 

5.             Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights
and Other Corporate Events.  

(a)               Purchase Rights.  In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7 below, if at any time the Company grants,
issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the   Purchase Rights ),  then each Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired
if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without
taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares) held by such Holder immediately
before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken,
the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights
(provided, however, to the extent that such Holder's right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder
exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent
(or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such
Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage). 

(b)             Other Corporate Events.  In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation
of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other
assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a   Corporate Event ),  the Company shall make
appropriate provision to insure that each Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other
assets to which such Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock
been held by such Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions
on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of
Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive
had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as
opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. The provisions
of this Section 5(b) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any
limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations. 

6.             Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions.  

(a)             Assumption.  The
Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity assumes in writing all
of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the
Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver
to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a
written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations, including, without
limitation, having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held
by the Holders and having similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and
(ii) the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose shares of common stock are
quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the
provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the  Company  shall
refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as
if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of
a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon
conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares
of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 5 and
11, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares prior to such
Fundamental Transaction, such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity
(including its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental
Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction
(without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations),
as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. The provisions of this Section 6 shall
apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on
the conversion of the Preferred Shares. 

7.             Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities.  

(a)             Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock.  If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company issues
or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the
issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded
Securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold) for a consideration per share (the  New Issuance
Price ) less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed
issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred to as the   Applicable Price )  (the
foregoing a   Dilutive Issuance ),  then, immediately after such Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price then
in effect shall be reduced to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation,
determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section 7(a)), the following shall be
applicable: 

(i)               Issuance
of Options.  If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share
of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall
be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such
Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the  lowest price per share for which one share
of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option  shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest
amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon
the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any
Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for
which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of
any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the
holder of such Option (or any other Person) upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option plus the value of any
other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person).
Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such
share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such
share of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

(ii)              Issuance
of Convertible Securities.  If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per
share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable
Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the
time of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the
 lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof'
shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company
with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise
or exchange of such Convertible Security and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible Security for which
one share of Common Stock is issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable
to the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) upon the issuance or sale of such Convertible Security plus the
value of any other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Convertible Security (or
any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance
of such share of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale
of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is
to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion
Price Shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 

(iii)             Change
in Option Price or Rate of Conversion.  If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time,
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would
have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase
price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted,
issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding
as of the Subscription Date are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such
Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall be
made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 

(iv)            Calculation
of Consideration Received.  If any Option or Convertible Security is issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed
issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Option or Convertible Security),
together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) such Option or Convertible Security (as applicable) will be deemed to have
been issued for consideration equal to the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors
and (y) the other securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed
to have been issued for consideration equal to the difference of (I) the aggregate consideration received by the Company minus
(II) the aggregate fair market value of all such Options and/or Convertible Securities (as applicable) so issued. If any shares
of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration
received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration
received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded
securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average
of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger
in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such
portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options
or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities
will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holders. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10)
days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the   Valuation Event ),  the fair value of such consideration
will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th ) day following such Valuation Event by an independent,
reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holders. The determination of such appraiser shall be final
and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 

(v)             Record
Date.  If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for
or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of
the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the
making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 

(b)             Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock.  Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and 11,
if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Sections 5
and 11, if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise)
one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become
effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under
this Section 7(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion
Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c)             Other
Events.  In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not
strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect any Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the
type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the
Board shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the
rights of such Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(c) will increase the Conversion Price as
otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7, provided further that if such Holder does not accept such adjustments as
appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Board and such Holder shall agree, in good
faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose
determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company. 

(d)             Calculations.
 All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made by rounding to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a cent or the nearest
1/100 th  of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include
shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue
or sale of Common Stock. 

8.             Authorized Shares.  

(a)             Reservation.  The
Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock equal to
125% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Base Amount of each Preferred Share as of the Initial Issuance Date
(assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement have been
issued, such Preferred Shares are convertible at the Conversion Price and without taking into account any limitations on the
conversion of such Preferred Shares set forth in herein) issuable pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations
from the Initial Issuance Date through the second anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date assuming (assuming for purposes
hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement have been issued and without
taking into account any limitations on the issuance of securities set forth herein). So long as any of the Preferred Shares
are outstanding, the Company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued
shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, as of any given date,
125% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the
Preferred Shares issued or issuable pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement assuming for purposes hereof, that all the
Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any
limitations on the issuance of securities set forth herein), provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common
Stock so available be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any
limitations on conversions contained in this Certificate of Designations) (the   Required Amount ).  The
initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Preferred Shares and each increase in the number of
shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of Preferred Shares held by each Holder
on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares (as the case may be) (the   Authorized Share
Allocation ).  In the event a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder's Preferred Shares,
each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common
Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining
Holders of Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of Preferred Shares then held by such Holders. 

(b)             Insufficient
Authorized Shares.  If, notwithstanding Section 8(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the Preferred
Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock to satisfy
its obligation to have available for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Required Amount (an   Authorized Share Failure ),  then the Company shall promptly take all action
necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve
and have available the Required Amount for all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders
or conduct a consent solicitation for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection
with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit
its stockholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its Board to recommend to the stockholders
that they approve such proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall limit any obligations of the Company under any provision
of the Securities Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of Common Stock upon a conversion
of any Preferred Share due to the failure by the Company to have sufficient shares of Common Stock available out of the authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock (such unavailable number of shares of Common Stock, the   Authorization Failure Shares ),
 in lieu of delivering such Authorization Failure Shares to such Holder of such Preferred Shares, the Company shall pay cash
in exchange for the cancellation of such Preferred Shares convertible into such Authorized Failure Shares at a price equal to
the sum of (i) the product of (x) such number of Authorization Failure Shares and (y) the Closing Sale Price on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with respect to such Authorization Failure
Shares to the Company and (ii) to the extent such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of Authorization Failure Shares, any brokerage commissions and other
out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder incurred in connection therewith. 

9.             Voting
Rights.  Holders of Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights, except as required by law (including without limitation,
the NGCL) and as expressly provided in this Certificate of Designations. To the extent that under the NGCL the vote of the
holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or Series As applicable, is required to authorize a given
action of the Company, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of all of the shares of the Preferred Shares, voting
together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required under the NGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at
which a quorum is presented or by written consent of all of the Preferred Shares (except as otherwise may be required under
the NGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required under the NGCL, shall constitute the
approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Subject to Section 4(e), to the extent that under the
NGCL holders of the Preferred Shares are entitled to vote on a matter with holders of shares of Common Stock, voting together
as one class, each Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock into which it is then convertible (subject to the ownership limitations specified in
Section 4(e) hereof) using the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters
as the date as of which the Conversion Price is calculated. Holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written
notice of all stockholder meetings or written consents (and copies of proxy materials and other information sent to
stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled by vote, which notice would be provided pursuant to the Company's
bylaws and the NGCL). 

10.             Liquidation,
Dissolution. Winding-Up.  In the event of a Liquidation Event, the Holders shall be entitled to receive in cash out of
the assets of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the   Liquidation
Funds ),  before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, an amount per Preferred
Share equal to the greater of (A) the Base Amount thereof on the date of such payment and  (B)  the amount per share
such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Shares into Common Stock immediately prior to the date of
such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the Holders and holders
of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation
Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation
preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full
amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the
extent necessary, the Company shall cause such actions to be taken by each of its Subsidiaries so as to enable, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a Liquidation Event to be distributed to the Holders in accordance with this
Section 10. All the preferential amounts to be paid to the Holders under this Section 10 shall be paid or set apart for
payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for, or the distribution of any Liquidation Funds of
the Company to the holders of shares of Junior Stock in connection with a Liquidation Event as to which this Section 10
applies. 

11.             Participation.  In
addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(b), the Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Shares, be entitled
to receive such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of shares of Common Stock to the same extent as if such
Holders had converted each Preferred Share held by each of them into shares of Common Stock (without regard to any
limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends
and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the
holders of shares of Common Stock (provided, however, to the extent that a Holder's right to participate in any such dividend
or distribution would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to
participate in such dividend or distribution to such extent (or the beneficial ownership of any such shares of Common Stock
as a result of such dividend or distribution to such extent) and such dividend or distribution to such extent shall be held
in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder
exceeding the Maximum Percentage). 

12.             Vote
to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares.  In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote
or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Articles of
Incorporation, without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent
without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, the Company shall not: (a) amend or repeal any
provision of, or add any provision to, its Articles of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or
articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any
respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit, of the Preferred Shares,
regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by
merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Preferred
Shares; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 2, create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class
or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Preferred Shares with respect to dividends or the
distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any
shares of capital stock of the Company junior in rank to the Preferred Shares (other than pursuant to equity incentive
agreements (that have in good faith been approved by the Board) with employees giving the Company the right to repurchase
shares upon the termination of services); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 2, pay dividends or make any other
distribution on any shares of any capital stock of the Company junior in rank to the Preferred Shares; (f) issue any
Preferred Shares other than pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section
16, whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares. 

13.             Covenants.  

(a)             Incurrence
of Indebtedness.  The Company shall not, and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, directly or
indirectly, incur or guarantee, assume or suffer to exist any Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness). 

(b)             Existence
of Liens.  The Company shall not, and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly,
allow or suffer to exist any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest or other encumbrance upon or in any property
or assets (including accounts and contract rights) owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
 Liens ) other than Permitted Liens. 

14.               Lost
or Stolen Certificates.  Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificates representing Preferred Shares (as to which a written certification and
the indemnification contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an
indemnification undertaking by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of
mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new certificate(s)
of like tenor and date. 

15.             Remedies,
Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief.  The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations
shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other
Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and no
remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Nothing herein
shall limit any Holder's right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms
of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this
instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion
and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder and shall not, except as expressly
provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that
a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such
breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Holder
shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any such breach or any such threatened
breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. The Company shall
provide all information and documentation to a Holder that is requested by such Holder to enable such Holder to confirm the Company's
compliance with the terms and conditions of this Certificate of Designations. 

16.             Noncircumvention.  The
Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, bylaws
or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of
this Certificate of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of
Designations and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate of Designations, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of
any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect,
(ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (iii) shall, so long as any
Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued
shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Preferred Shares then
outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). 

17.             Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver.  No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or
privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver shall be effective unless
it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed
to be jointly drafted by the Company and all Holders and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. 

18.             Notices.  The Company shall provide each Holder of Preferred Shares with prompt written notice of all actions taken
pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the
reason therefor. Whenever notice is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein,
such notice must be in writing and shall be given in accordance with Section 8(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give written notice to each Holder (i) promptly following any adjustment
of the Conversion Price, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such adjustment and (ii) at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or
distribution upon the Common Stock, (B) with respect to any grant, issuances, or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or
rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property to all holders of shares of Common Stock as a class or (C) for
determining rights to vote with respect to any Fundamental Transaction, dissolution or liquidation, provided, in each case, that
such information shall be made known to the public prior to, or simultaneously with, such notice being provided to any Holder. 

19.             Transfer of Preferred Shares.  Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2(g) of the Securities Purchase Agreement,
a Holder may transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares without the consent of the Company. 

20.             Preferred Shares Register.  The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or
agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the Holders), a register for the Preferred Shares, in which the Company
shall record the name, address and facsimile number of the Persons in whose name the Preferred Shares have been issued, as well
as the name and address of each transferee. The Company may treat the Person in whose name any Preferred Shares is registered on
the register as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in all events recognizing
any properly made transfers. 

21.             Stockholder Matters; Amendment.  

(a)             Stockholder
Matters.  Any stockholder action, approval or consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Company pursuant to
the NGCL, the Articles of Incorporation, this Certificate of Designations or otherwise with respect to the issuance of
Preferred Shares may be effected by written consent of the Company's stockholders or at a duly called meeting of the
Company's stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the NGCL. This provision is intended
to comply with the applicable sections of the NGCL permitting stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written
consent in lieu of a meeting. 

(b)             Amendment.  This
Certificate of Designations or any provision hereof may be amended by obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called
for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the NGCL, of the Required Holders, voting
separate as a single class, and with such other stockholder approval, if any, as may then be required pursuant to the NGCL
and the Articles of Incorporation. 

22.             Dispute Resolution.  

(a)             Disputes Over Closing
Bid Price, Closing Sale Price, Conversion Price, VWAP or Fair Market Value.   

(i)            In
the case of a dispute relating to a Closing Bid Price, a Closing Sale Price, a Conversion Price, a VWAP or fair market value (as
the case may be) (including, without limitation, a dispute relating to the determination of any of the foregoing), the Company
or such applicable Holder (as the case may be) shall submit the dispute via facsimile (I) within two (2) Business Days after delivery
of the applicable notice giving rise to such dispute to the Company or such Holder (as the case may be) or (II) if no notice gave
rise to such dispute, at any time after such Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If such Holder and
the Company are unable to resolve such dispute relating to such Closing Bid Price, such Closing Sale Price, such Conversion Price,
such VWAP or such fair market value (as the case may be) by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the third (3rd) Business Day following
such delivery by the Company or such Holder (as the case may be) of such dispute to the Company or such Holder (as the case may
be), then such Holder shall select an independent, reputable investment bank to resolve such dispute. 

(ii)           Such
Holder and the Company shall each deliver to such investment bank (x) a copy of the initial dispute submission so delivered in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 22(a) and (y) written documentation supporting its position with respect to
such dispute, in each case, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) by the fifth (5 th ) Business Day immediately following
the date on which such Holder selected such investment bank (the   Dispute Submission Deadline )  (the documents
referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) are collectively referred to herein as the   Required Dispute
Documentation )  (it being understood and agreed that if either such Holder or the Company fails to so deliver all of
the Required Dispute Documentation by the Dispute Submission Deadline, then the party who fails to so submit all of the Required
Dispute Documentation shall no longer be entitled to (and hereby waives its right to) deliver or submit any written documentation
or other support to such investment bank with respect to such dispute and such investment bank shall resolve such dispute based
solely on the Required Dispute Documentation that was delivered to such investment bank prior to the Dispute Submission Deadline).
Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both the Company and such Holder or otherwise requested by such investment bank, neither
the Company nor such Holder shall be entitled to deliver or submit any written documentation or other support to such investment
bank in connection with such dispute (other than the Required Dispute Documentation). 

(iii)          The Company and such
Holder shall cause such investment bank to determine the resolution of such dispute and notify the Company and such Holder of
such resolution no later than ten (10) Business Days immediately following the Dispute Submission Deadline. The fees and expenses
of such investment bank shall be borne solely by the Company, and such investment bank's resolution of such 'dispute shall be
final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error. 

(b)             Disputes Over Arithmetic Calculation of the Conversion
Rate.   

(i)            In the case of
a dispute as to the arithmetic calculation of a Conversion Rate, the Company or such Holder (as the case may be) shall submit
the disputed arithmetic calculation via facsimile (i) within two (2) Business Days after delivery of the applicable notice giving
rise to such dispute to the Company or such Holder (as the case may be) or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute, at any
time after such Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If such Holder and the Company are unable to
resolve such disputed arithmetic calculation of such Conversion Rate by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the third (3 1d )
Business Day following such delivery by the Company or such Holder (as the case may be) of such disputed arithmetic calculation,
then such Holder shall select an independent, reputable accountant or accounting firm to perform such disputed arithmetic calculation. 

(ii)           Such
Holder and the Company shall each deliver to such accountant or accounting firm (as the case may be) (x) a copy of the
initial dispute submission so delivered in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 22(a) and (y) written
documentation supporting its position with respect to such disputed arithmetic calculation, in each case, no later than 5:00
p.m. (New York time) by the fifth (5 th ) Business Day immediately following the date on which such Holder selected
such accountant or accounting firm (as the case may be) (the  Submission Deadline ) (the documents referred to in
the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) are collectively referred to herein as the   Required
Documentation )  (it being understood and agreed that if either such Holder or the Company fails to so deliver all of

2. 
     Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

     The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  

a. 
     Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
