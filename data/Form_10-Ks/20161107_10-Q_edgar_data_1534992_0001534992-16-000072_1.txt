Retained Amount    shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) of the Total Benefits net of all federal, state and local taxes imposed on Executive with respect thereto.

    20.2        Section 409A of the Code  . The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with section 409A of the Code, to the extent subject thereto, and accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith.  It is intended that (i) each installment of the payments provided under this Agreement is a separate  payment  for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) the payments satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A of the Code provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) and 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v).  For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to the termination of Executive s employment will be deemed to mean  severance from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company determines (i) that on the date the Executive s employment with the Company terminates or at such other time that the Company determines to be relevant, the Executive is a  specified Executive  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)(1)) of the Company and (ii) that any payments to be provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are or may become subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any other taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the Code if provided at the time otherwise required under this Agreement, then such payments shall be delayed until the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company, or, if earlier, the date of the Executive s death.  Any payments delayed pursuant to this Section shall be made in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)), or, if earlier, the date of the Executive s death.

For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to the termination of Executive s employment will be deemed to mean  severance from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company determines (i) that on the date the Executive s employment with the Company terminates or at such other time that the Company determines to be relevant, the Executive is a  specified Executive  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)(1)) of the Company and (ii) that any payments to be provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are or may become subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any other taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the Code if provided at the time otherwise required under this Agreement, then such payments shall be delayed until the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company, or, if earlier, the date of the Executive s death.

  20.        Additional Tax Provisions  . 
    20.1        Golden Parachutes  .

   5 

provided, however, that no such reduction in the Total Benefits shall be made if by not making such reduction, Executive s Retained Amount (as hereinafter defined) would be greater than Executive s Retained Amount if the Total Benefits are not so reduced.     Retained Amount    shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) of the Total Benefits net of all federal, state and local taxes imposed on Executive with respect thereto. To the extent any reduction is required, the Total Benefits shall be reduced in the following order: (i) any portion of the Total Benefits that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code (other than Total Benefits resulting from any accelerated vesting of equity awards), (ii) Total Benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Code in reverse order of when payment is due, and (iii) Total Benefits that are not subject to Section 409A and arise from any accelerated vesting of any equity awards.  
    20.2        Section 409A of the Code  . The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with section 409A of the Code, to the extent subject thereto, and accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith.  It is intended that (i) each installment of the payments provided under this Agreement is a separate  payment  for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) the payments satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A of the Code provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) and 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v).  For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to the termination of Executive s employment will be deemed to mean  severance from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company determines (i) that on the date the Executive s employment with the Company terminates or at such other time that the Company determines to be relevant, the Executive is a  specified Executive  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)(1)) of the Company and (ii) that any payments to be provided to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are or may become subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any other taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the Code if provided at the time otherwise required under this Agreement, then such payments shall be delayed until the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company, or, if earlier, the date of the Executive s death.  Any payments delayed pursuant to this Section shall be made in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)), or, if earlier, the date of the Executive s death.
