CONDENSED NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

  Nature of Business   

 Unico American Corporation (the  Company 
or  Unico ) is an insurance holding company that underwrites property and casualty insurance through its insurance
company subsidiary; provides property, casualty, and health insurance through its agency subsidiaries; and provides insurance premium
financing and membership association services through its other subsidiaries. References to Unico or the Company include both the
corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. Unico was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 1969. 

Principles of Consolidation   

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Unico American Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis of Presentation  

 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim
financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X for smaller reporting companies. Accordingly,
the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016, are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. Quarterly financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form
10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to
conform to the current quarter s presentation. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the
Financial Statements  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect its reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
its disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements, as well as its reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant assumptions in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements relate to losses and loss adjustment expenses. While every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such
estimates, actual results may differ. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (the exit price). Financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
fair value are categorized based on the reliability of inputs for the valuation techniques. (See Note 8.) 

The Company has used the following methods and
assumptions in estimating its fair value disclosures: 

Fixed maturities: 

1.    Investment securities,
excluding long-term certificates of deposit   Fair values are obtained from a national quotation service.    

2.    Long-term certificates
of deposit   The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these instruments approximate their fair
values.    

Cash and short-term investments   The
carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair values given the short-term nature of these
instruments. 

Receivables, net   The carrying amounts
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair values given the short-term nature of these instruments. 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities  
The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate the fair values given the short-term nature of these
instruments.

NOTE 2   REPURCHASE OF COMMON
STOCK   EFFECTS ON STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

 On December 19, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire, from time
to time, up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. This program has no expiration date and may
be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had
remaining authority under the 2008 program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 188,655 and 197,467 shares of its common stock,
respectively. The 2008 program is the only program under which there is authority to repurchase shares of the Company s common
stock. The Company did not repurchase any stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company repurchased 8,812
shares of stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $89,582 of which $4,331
was allocated to capital and $85,251 was allocated to retained earnings. The Company repurchased 9,630 shares of stock during the
three months ended September 30, 2015, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $94,372 of which $4,733 was allocated to capital
and $89,639 was allocated to retained earnings. The Company repurchased 11,834 shares of stock during the nine months ended September
30, 2015, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $117,862 of which $5,816 was allocated to capital and $112,046 was allocated
to retained earnings. The Company has or will retire all repurchased stock. 

NOTE 3   LOSS PER
SHARE  

 The following table represents
the reconciliation of the Company's basic loss per share and diluted loss per share computations reported on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Basic earnings per share exclude the impact
of common share equivalents and are based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share utilize
the average market price per share when applying the treasury stock method in determining common share dilution. When outstanding
stock options are dilutive, they are treated as common share equivalents for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share and
represent the difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In loss periods, stock options are excluded
from the calculation of diluted loss per share, as the inclusion of stock options would have an anti-dilutive effect. As of September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had 222 and 0 common share equivalents that were excluded in the three months diluted loss per share
calculation, respectively, and 530 and 3,682 common share equivalents that were excluded in the nine months diluted loss per share
calculation, respectively. 

NOTE 4   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

 In June 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-13  Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing
credit losses with a current expected credit loss model, which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial
assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
ASU 2016-13 also requires enhanced disclosures for better understanding of significant estimates and judgments used in estimating
credit losses. The Company is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements,
but expects the primary changes to be (i) the use of the expected credit loss model for its premium receivables and reinsurance
recoverables and (ii) the presentation of credit losses within the available-for-sale fixed maturities portfolio through an allowance
method rather than as a direct write-down. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2019,
but provides for an early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018. The Company has not determined when it
will adopt ASU 2016-13. 

7  of 26  

In May 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-09  Disclosures
About Short-Duration Contracts.  The objective of this ASU is to increase transparency about significant estimates in unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses and provide additional information about amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows related
to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. ASU 2015-09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. The disclosure mandated by ASU 2015-09 will become effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods ended
on and after December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 5   ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME
TAXES  

 The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
file consolidated federal and state income tax returns. Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement, Crusader Insurance Company ( Crusader )
and American Acceptance Corporation ( AAC ), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, are allocated taxes or tax credits,
in the case of losses, at current corporate rates based on their own taxable income or loss. The Company files income tax returns
under U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal income tax authorities
for tax returns filed starting at taxable year 2013 and California state income tax authorities for tax returns filed starting
at taxable year 2012. There are no ongoing examinations of income tax returns by federal or state tax authorities. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015,
the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. In addition, the Company had not accrued interest and penalties related
to unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. However, if interest and penalties would need to be accrued related to unrecognized
tax benefits or liabilities, such amounts would be recognized as a component of federal income tax expense. 

As a California insurance company, Crusader
is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states in which Crusader is admitted. Premium taxes are deferred
and amortized as the related premiums are earned. The premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the
provision for state taxes. 

NOTE 6   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,
NET  

 Property and equipment consist of the
following: 

Depreciation
on the Calabasas building, owned by Crusader, is computed using the straight line method over 39 years. Depreciation on  furniture,
fixtures and equipment in the Calabasas building is  computed using the straight line method
over 3 to 15 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements in the Calabasas building is being computed using the shorter of the
useful life of the leasehold improvements or the remaining years of the lease.   

Depreciation
and amortization expense on all property and equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $121,577 and
$361,490, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $114,634 and $348,979, respectively.  

The Calabasas
building has generated rental revenue from non-affiliated tenants in the amount of $55,099 and $171,133 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $51,552 and $140,518 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This rental revenue is included in  Other income  from insurance company operation in the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Operations.  

The Calabasas
building has incurred operating expenses (including depreciation) in the amount of $207,401 and $543,638 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $180,146 and $524,351 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, respectively. These operating expenses are included in  Other operating expenses  in the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Operations.  

8  of 26  

The total
square footage of the Calabasas building is 46,884, including common areas. As of September 30, 2016, 10,292 square feet
of the Calabasas building was leased to non-affiliated entities and 4,189 square feet was vacant and available to be leased to
non-affiliated entities.  

The Company capitalizes certain computer software
costs purchased from outside vendors for internal use. These costs also include configuration and customization activities, coding,
testing and installation. Training costs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while upgrade and enhancements are capitalized
if it is probable that such expenditure will result in additional functionality. The capitalized costs are not depreciated until
the software is placed into production. 

On October 9, 2015, the Company concluded that
a charge for impairment of the Company s capitalized computer software costs, related to a contract entered into on November
1, 2012, was required under GAAP. The capitalized costs which were all incurred through the quarter ended June 30, 2015, included
$1,287,460 of paid and $223,442 of accrued unpaid invoices from the software vendor, Insurance Systems, Inc. ( ISI ).
The impact of this impairment to the Company s consolidated statements of operations was a charge of $1,287,460 before income
taxes in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Company did not intend to pay the accrued unpaid invoices which have been reversed
from the accrued expenses and other liabilities and capitalized computer software costs as of September 30, 2015. In accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 855,  Subsequent Events,  this impairment was reported
as a subsequent event on the Company s consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2015. The decision to impair
the asset was based on the Company s beliefs that the ISI software had not achieved and would not be able to achieve the
Company s expected implementation targets and that the Company was unable to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with
ISI. The fair value of the capitalized costs was deemed to be $0. The charge was included in other operating expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

NOTE 7   SEGMENT REPORTING  

 ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting, 
establishes standards for the way information about operating segments is reported in financial statements. The Company has identified
its insurance company operation as its primary reporting segment. Revenues from this segment comprised 92% of total revenues for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 92% and 91% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services,
each with unique characteristics and individually insignificant to total revenues. 

Revenues, income (loss) before
income taxes, and assets by segment are as follows: 

9  of 26  

(1)    Intersegment revenue eliminations
reflect rents paid by Unico to Crusader for space leased in the Calabasas building and commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax Insurance
Systems, Inc. ( Unifax ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Unico.     

(2)    Intersegment asset eliminations
reflect the elimination of Crusader receivables from Unifax and Unifax payables to Crusader.    

NOTE 8   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

 In determining the fair value of its
financial instruments, the Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for the valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). Financial
assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value are categorized based on the reliability
of inputs for the valuation techniques as follows: 

Level 1   Financial assets and
financial liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
as of the reporting date. 

Level 2   Financial assets and
financial liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; or valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability as of the reporting date. 

Level 3   Financial assets and
financial liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and
significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect the Company s estimates of the assumptions that market
participants would use in valuing the financial assets and financial liabilities as of the reporting date. 

The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the fair value hierarchy level within which the fair value measurement
in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) or unobservable
(Level 3). The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

The following table presents information
about the Company s consolidated financial instruments and their estimated fair values, which are measured on a recurring
basis, and are allocated among the three levels within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015: 

10  of 26  

Fair value measurements are not adjusted
for transaction costs. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances
that caused the transfer. The Company did not have any transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

NOTE 9   INVESTMENTS  

 A summary of total investment income and
net realized losses is as follows: 

The amortized cost and estimated fair
values of investments in fixed maturities by category are as follows: 

A summary of the unrealized gains (losses)
on investments carried at fair value and the applicable deferred federal income taxes is shown below: 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had one fixed
maturity investment with gross unrealized losses of $79 for a continuous period of less than 12 months and no fixed maturity investments
with gross unrealized losses for a continuous period of more than 12 months. At December 31, 2015, the Company had three fixed
maturity investments with gross unrealized losses of $38,509 for a continuous period of less than 12 months and two fixed maturity
investments with gross unrealized losses of $6,115 for a continuous period of more than 12 months. 

The Company closely monitors its investments.
If an unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, it is written off as a realized loss through the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The Company s methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis
as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the
fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the debtor
is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments. The unrealized losses on the U.S. treasury securities
in unrealized loss positions as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were determined to be temporary. 

11  of 26  

Although the Company does not intend to sell
its fixed maturity investments prior to maturity, the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to cash
flow requirements, economic and/or market conditions. The Company sold three certificates of deposit prior to their maturity during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These securities had an amortized cost of $746,000. The Company realized an investment
loss of $1,278 on the sale. The Company did not sell any fixed maturity investments and there were no realized investment gains
or losses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, nor during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities are reported as  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),  which
is a separate component of stockholders  equity, net of any deferred tax effect. 

The Company s
investment in certificates of deposit included $62,919,000 and $57,527,000 of brokered certificates of deposit as of September
30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. Brokered certificates of deposit provide the safety and security of a certificate
of deposit combined with the convenience gained by one-stop shopping for rates at various institutions. This allows the Company
to spread its investments across multiple institutions so that all of its certificates of deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). Brokered certificates of deposit are purchased through UnionBanc Investment Services,
LLC, a registered broker-dealer, investment advisor, member of FINRA/SIPC, and a subsidiary of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. Brokered
certificates of deposit are a direct obligation of the issuing depository institution, are bank products of the issuing depository
institution, are held by Union Bank Global Custody Services for the benefit of the Company, and are FDIC insured within permissible
limits. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company s remaining certificates of deposit totaling $600,000
are from four different banks and represent statutory deposits that are assigned to and are held by the California State Treasurer
and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Nevada. These deposits are required for writing certain lines of business in California
and for admission in the state of Nevada. All the Company s brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit are within
the FDIC insured permissible limits. 

Short-term investments have an initial maturity of one year
or less and consist of the following: 

NOTE 10   CONTINGENCIES  

 The Company, by virtue of the nature of the
business conducted by it, becomes involved in numerous legal proceedings as either plaintiff or defendant. From time to time, the
Company is required to  resort to legal proceedings against vendors providing services to the
Company or against customers or their agents to enforce collection of premiums, commissions,  or fees. These routine items
of litigation do not materially affect the Company and are handled on a routine basis by the Company through its counsel. 

The Company
establishes reserves for lawsuits, regulatory actions, and other contingencies for which the Company is able to estimate its potential
exposure and believes a loss is probable. For loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible, the Company discloses the
nature of the loss contingency, an estimate of the possible loss, a range of loss, or a statement that such an estimate cannot
be made.   

Likewise,
the Company is sometimes named as a cross-defendant in litigation, which is principally directed against an insured who was issued
a policy of insurance directly or indirectly through the Company. Incidental actions related to disputes concerning the issuance
or non-issuance of individual policies are sometimes brought by customers or others. These items are also handled on a routine
basis by counsel, and they do not generally affect the operations of the Company. Management is confident that the ultimate outcome
of pending litigation should not have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
The Company vigorously defends itself unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate.  

In December
2015, a judgment was finalized on a Crusader policy liability claim. Crusader is appealing the judgment. As a part of the appeal,
Crusader deposited $7,924,178 in cash in lieu of an appeal bond with the Los Angeles Superior Court on December 28, 2015. This
cash deposit was required to appeal the judgment. In March 2016, an additional judgment for plaintiff s attorney fees and
costs on this Crusader policy liability claim was finalized. The Company is also appealing this additional judgment. That additional
appeal required an additional cash deposit in lieu of an appeal bond of $5,449,615. The additional cash deposit was made on March
21, 2016. These cash deposits for the appeals represent 150% of the judgments. The cash deposits in lieu of an appeal bond of $13,373,793
and $7,924,178 were included in  Other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, respectively. Management believes the ultimate outcome of this litigation will be covered by Crusader s reinsurance,
subject to retention and participation. Since this litigation was related to a Crusader claim in its normal course of business,
management s best estimate for ultimate liability related to this litigation was included in Crusader s loss and loss
adjustment expense reserves as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015.

One of
the Company s agents, which was appointed in 2008 to assist the Company in implementing its Trucking Program, failed to
pay the net premium and policy fees due Unifax, the exclusive general agent for Crusader. The agent was initially late in paying
its February 2009 production that was due to Unifax on April 15, 2009. In May 2009, as a result of the agent s failure to
timely pay its balance due to Unifax, the Company terminated its agency agreement and assumed ownership and control of that agent s
policy expirations written with the Company. The Company subsequently commenced legal proceedings against the agent corporation,
its three principals (who personally guaranteed the agent s obligations) and another individual for the recovery of the
balance due and any related recovery costs incurred. All related recovery costs have been expensed as incurred. The agent corporation
and two of its principals filed bankruptcy. The corporation was adjudicated bankrupt. The Company obtained judgments, non-dischargeable
in bankruptcy, for the full amount due from the two principals who filed bankruptcy. The other principal stipulated to a judgment
of $1,200,000. The other individual paid the Company to settle the claim against him. The Company collected $0 during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the agent s balance
due to Unifax was $1,181,272. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company s bad debt reserve associated
with this matter was $1,181,272, which represents 100% of the balance due to Unifax. Although the receivable is fully reserved
for financial reporting purposes at September 30, 2016, the Company continues to pursue collection of the judgments from the three
principals.  

On October 9, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court for the State of California, County
of Los Angeles, Central District against ISI. The lawsuit sought an unspecified amount in monetary damages plus punitive damages
against ISI. Causes of action stated in the lawsuit included fraudulent inducement and intentional misrepresentation, negligent
misrepresentation, negligence, violation of business and professional code, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach
of implied warranty of fitness, breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings. Subsequently,
the lawsuit was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California and all causes of action have
been disallowed by the court except for breach of contract. On May 16, 2016, ISI filed a countersuit against the Company for $1,792,398
for unpaid invoices plus damages for alleged breach of the contract related to implementation of the ISI computer software by the
Company. The Company is vigorously defending the countersuit and believes it to be without merit. The Company has asserted various
affirmative defenses in opposition to the ISI countersuit including defenses of fraud in inducement, fraudulent concealment, and
negligent misrepresentation.

This overview discusses some of the relevant
factors that management considers in evaluating the Company's performance, prospects and risks. It is not all inclusive and is
meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of the management discussion and analysis, the Company's consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Revenue
and Income Generation  

  The
Company receives its revenues primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operation, commission and fee income
generated from the insurance agency operation, fee income from the premium finance operation, and investment income from cash generated
primarily from the insurance company operation. The insurance company operation generated approximately 92% of   total
revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 92% and 91% of total revenues for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company s remaining operations constitute a variety of
specialty insurance services, each with unique characteristics and individually not material to total revenues.  

Insurance
Company Operation  

 As of September 30, 2016, Crusader Insurance
Company ( Crusader ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was licensed as an admitted insurance carrier in the
states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. From 2004 until June 2014, all of Crusader s business was
written in the state of California. In June 2014, Crusader began writing business in the state of Arizona. During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, 99.7% and 99.5% of Crusader s total direct written premium (before premium ceded to
reinsurers) was produced in California, respectively, compared to 99.6% and 99.5% for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively. 99% of Crusader s business was commercial multi-peril policies for the three months and nine ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. On October 28, 2016, A.M. Best Company reaffirmed Crusader s financial strength rating of A-
(Excellent) and a rating outlook of  stable.  In addition, A.M. Best Company assigned Crusader an Issuer Credit Rating
of a- (Excellent). 

The property and casualty insurance business
is cyclical in nature, and the previous years have been characterized as a  soft market.  The conditions of a soft
market include premium rates that are stable or falling and insurance is readily available. Contrarily,  hard market 
conditions occur during periods in which premium rates rise and coverage may be more difficult to find. The Company believes that
the California property and casualty insurance market is intensely competitive but relatively stable. 

Written premium is a financial measure that
is defined, under statutory accounting principles, as the contractually determined amount charged by the insurance company to the
policyholder for the effective period of the contract based on the expectation of risk, policy benefits, and expenses associated
with the coverage provided by the terms of the policies. Written premium is a required statutory measure. Written premium is not
defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Earned premium, the most directly comparable
GAAP measure, represents the portion of written premium that is recognized as income in the financial statements for the period
presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. 

The following is a reconciliation of net
written premium to net earned premium (after premium ceded to reinsurers): 

14  of 26  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
direct written premium, as reported on Crusader s statutory financial statements was $9,667,046 compared to $9,119,548 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $547,498 (6%). For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, direct written
premium as reported on Crusader s statutory financial statements was $29,120,412 compared to $27,699,119 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,421,293 (5%). 

Insurance company operation underwriting
profitability is defined by pre-tax underwriting profit, which is calculated as net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment
expenses and policy acquisition costs. 

Crusader s underwriting profit before
income taxes is as follows: 

The following table provides
an analysis of the losses and loss adjustment expenses: 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses were
101% and 77% of net earned premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 57% and 63%
of net earned premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Revenues
from Other Insurance Operations   

 The Company s revenues from other
insurance operations consist of commissions, fees, investment and other income. Excluding investment and other income, these operations
accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately
8% and 9% of total revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Investments
and Liquidity  

 The Company generated revenues from
its total invested assets of $90,782,232 (at amortized cost) and $106,417,552 (at amortized cost) as of September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and from two cash deposits by Crusader, in lieu of appeal bonds, placed with the Los Angeles Superior Court.
These deposits, totaling $13,373,793, were made on December 28, 2015, for $7,924,178 and on March 21, 2016, for $5,449,615, and
their respective balances were included in  Other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30,
2016, and December 31, 2015. Investment income included in insurance company operation and other insurance operations revenue
increased $105,752 (82%) and $344,950 (110%) to $234,570 and $659,111 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to $128,818 and $314,161 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase
in investment income was primarily a result of an increase in the Company s annualized yield on average invested assets
to 1.0% and 0.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from 0.5% and 0.4% for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets is primarily a
result of reinvesting the proceeds of matured short-term and fixed maturity investments into higher yielding fixed maturity investments.
Due to the current interest rate and financial market environment, management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity
investments with maturities of 5 years or less and with minimal credit risk. As of September 30, 2016, all of the Company s
investments are in U.S. treasury securities, FDIC insured certificates of deposit, money market funds and a savings account. The
Company s investments in U.S treasury securities and money market funds are readily marketable. As of September 30, 2016,
the weighted average maturity of the Company s investments was approximately 1.1 years. 

15  of 26  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 Crusader generates a significant amount of cash
as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves, its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense payments, and its capital
and surplus. Crusader's loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the Company.
These payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the Company has the liquidity to cover these payments without
the need to liquidate its investments. Cash and investments (at amortized cost) of the Company at September 30, 2016, were $91,997,503
compared to $98,178,025 at December 31, 2015. Crusader's cash and investments were 99% of the total cash and investments (at amortized
cost) held by the Company as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had  invested $82,607,624 (at amortized cost) or 91%  of its total invested assets in
fixed maturity obligations, which  included $19,088,624 (23% of fixed maturity investments)
in U.S. treasury notes and $63,519,000 (77% of fixed maturity investments) in long-term certificates of deposit.  As of December
31, 2015, the Company had  invested $82,202,727 (at amortized cost) or 84%  of its total
invested assets in fixed maturity obligations, which  included $24,075,727 (29% of fixed maturity
investments) in U.S. treasury notes and $58,127,000 (71% of fixed maturity investments) in long-term certificates of deposit.
 The remaining balance of the Company's investments are in short-term investments that include U.S. treasury bills, a U.S.
treasury money market fund, certificates of deposit, bank money market accounts and a bank savings account which are all highly
rated and redeemable within one year. 

The Company is required to classify its investment
securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading securities. Although all of the Company's
investment in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale, and, while the Company may sell investment securities,
from time to time, in response to economic and market conditions, its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and
holding high-quality investments to maturity. 

The Company s investment guidelines on
equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of $2,000,000. The Company s investment
guidelines on fixed maturities limit those investments to high-grade obligations with a maximum term of 8 years. The maximum investment
authorized in any one issuer is $2,000,000. This dollar limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and U.S.
government or U.S. government guaranteed issues. When the Company invests in fixed maturity municipal securities, preference is
given to issues that are pre-refunded and secured by U.S. treasury securities. The short-term investments are either U.S. government
obligations, FDIC insured, or are in an institution with a Moody's rating of at least P2 and/or a Standard   Poor's rating
of A1. All of the Company's fixed maturity investment securities are rated, readily marketable, and could be liquidated without
any materially adverse financial impact. 

On December 19, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire, from time
to time, up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. This program has no expiration date and may
be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had
remaining authority under the 2008 program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 188,655 and 197,467 shares of its common stock,
respectively. The 2008 program is the only program under which there is authority to repurchase shares of the Company s common
stock. The Company did not repurchase any stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company repurchased 8,812
shares of stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $89,582 of which $4,331
was allocated to capital and $85,251 was allocated to retained earnings. The Company repurchased 9,630 shares of stock during the
three months ended September 30, 2015, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $94,372 of which $4,733 was allocated to capital
and $89,639 was allocated to retained earnings. The Company repurchased 11,834 shares of stock during the nine months ended September
30, 2015, in unsolicited transactions at a cost of $117,862 of which $5,816 was allocated to capital and $112,046 was allocated
to retained earnings. The Company has or will retire all repurchased stock. 

16  of 26  

The Company reported $5,567,253 net
cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $307,183 net cash used by
operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The largest contributor to the use of cash for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, was a $5,449,615 cash deposit by Crusader in lieu of an appeal bond placed with the Los Angeles Superior
Court on March 21, 2016. No investments were sold prior to their maturity to fund this cash deposit. This cash deposit was in
addition to the  $ 7,924,178 cash deposit by Crusader in lieu of an appeal bond placed
with the Los Angeles Superior Court on December 28, 2015, to appeal two judgments on a Crusader policy liability claim. 

Other fluctuations in cash flows from
operating activities relate to the timing of the collection and the payment of insurance-related receivables and payables. The
variability of the Company s losses and loss adjustment expenses is due primarily to its small claims population which may
result in greater fluctuations in claim frequency and/or severity. Although the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect net
cash used by operating activities, the Company does not anticipate future liquidity problems, and it continues to be well capitalized
and adequately reserved.  

Although material capital expenditures
may also be funded through borrowings, the Company believes that its cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2016,  net
of  statutory deposits of $700,000, and California insurance company statutory dividend restrictions applicable to Crusader,
plus the cash to be generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next 12 months
without the necessity of borrowing funds. Since trust receivables were in excess of trust payables, there were no trust restrictions
on cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2016. 

Results of Operations   

 All comparisons made in this discussion
are comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, unless
otherwise indicated. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues were $8,998,342 and $26,250,652, respectively, an
increase of $546,839 (6%)   and $1,653,259
(7%), compared to total revenues of $8,451,503 and $24,597,393 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a loss before taxes of $2,966,722
and $3,028,154, respectively, an increase in loss before taxes of $1,999,082 (207%) and $1,652,150 (120%), compared to a
loss before taxes of $967,640 and $1,376,004 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,953,497 and $2,001,454, respectively, an
increase in net loss of $1,303,987 (201%) and $1,067,540 (114%), compared to net loss of $649,510 and $933,914
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   

The increase in revenues of $546,839 (6%) for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to September 30, 2015, was primarily due to an increase in net earned
premium of $417,336 (6%). The increase in revenues of $1,653,259 (7%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared
to September 30, 2015, was primarily due to an increase in net earned premium of $1,414,703 (6%). 

The increase in loss before tax of $1,999,082 (207%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $3,691,583
(85%) partially offset by the increase in net earned premium of $417,336 (6%) and a decrease of $1,287,460 (100%) in capitalized
computer software costs impairment. The increase in loss before tax of $1,652,150 (120%) for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses
of $4,108,411 (30%) partially offset by the increase in net earned premium of $1,414,703 (6%) and a decrease of $1,287,460 (100%)
in capitalized computer software costs impairment. The Company incurred capitalized computer software costs impairment of $0 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1,287,460 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively. 

Written premium  is a required statutory
measure. Direct written premium reported on Crusader s statutory financial statements increased $547,498 (6%) and $1,421,293
(5%) to $9,667,046 and $29,120,412 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $9,119,548
and $27,699,119 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The property casualty insurance marketplace
continues to be intensely competitive. While Crusader attempts to meet such competition with competitive prices, its emphasis
is on service, promotion, and distribution. Crusader believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that
underwriting profit (net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs) is its primary
goal. Nonetheless, Crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability by continuing to focus upon four areas of its
operations: (1) product development, (2) improved service to retail brokers, (3) appointment of captive and independent retail
agents, and (4) geographical expansion. While the Company s policy administration system continues to support the Company s
existing operations, the Company believes it would realize more competitive parity with respect to product and service by switching
or upgrading to a more contemporary platform. The Company is currently evaluating potential firms and consultants to assist it
with development and execution of its information technology and marketing efforts. Crusader does not intend to substantially
increase its number of appointed retail agents until the Company replaces its policy administration system.

Earned premium  (before reinsurance)
increased $600,266 (7%) to $9,529,911 and $2,004,961 (8%) to $27,797,515 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to $8,929,645 and $25,792,554 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The
Company writes annual policies and, therefore, earns written premium ratably over the one-year policy term. 

Ceded earned premium increased $182,930
(13%) to $1,548,981 and $590,258 (15%) to $4,526,219 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to $1,366,051 and $3,935,961 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Ceded earned premium as a percentage
of direct earned premium (before reinsurance) was 16% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 15% for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In calendar years 2016 and 2015, Crusader retained
a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 10% in its 1 st  layer ($500,000 in excess of $500,000),
0% in its 2 nd  layer ($2,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000) and 0% in its property and casualty clash treaty. In calendar
year 2016, Crusader retained a participation in its catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1 st 
layer ($9,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000) and 0% in its 2 nd  layer ($36,000,000 in excess of $10,000,000). In calendar
year 2015, Crusader retained a participation in its catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1 st 
layer ($9,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000) and 0% in its 2 nd  layer ($31,000,000 in excess of $10,000,000). The Company
monitors its catastrophe exposure no less than on an annual basis and purchases the level of coverage deemed appropriate. 

Crusader s excess of loss reinsurance
treaties provided for a contingent commission for accident years 2006, 2004 and 2003. Crusader s 2006 1 st  layer
primary excess of loss reinsurance treaty provided for a contingent commission equal to 20% of the net profit, if any, accruing
to the reinsurer. Crusader s 2004 and 2003 1 st  layer primary excess of loss reinsurance treaties provided for
a contingent commission to the Company equal to 45% of the net profit, if any, accruing to the reinsurer. Any contingent commission
received is subject to return based on future development of ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses. As of September 30, 2016,
and December 31, 2015, the unearned contingent commission balance included in  Accrued expenses and other liabilities 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $0. The contingent commission income recognized was $0 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and $0 and $91,686 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Company evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance
contracts at its inception to determine if there is a sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance
under GAAP. As of September 30, 2016, all such ceded contracts were accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance. 

Crusader s direct, ceded
and net earned premium are as follows: 

The Company is currently negotiating its 2017
excess of loss reinsurance treaty. Based on initial indications, the Company expects a rate increase on that treaty; however, the
increase cannot yet be quantified.

Investment
income,  included in insurance company operation and other insurance operations revenues,    
 increased $105,752 (82%) to $234,570 and $344,950 (110%) to $659,111 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to $128,818 and $314,161 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

The increase in investment income was
primarily a result of an increase in the Company s annualized yield on average invested assets to 1.0% and 0.9% for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from 0.5% and 0.4% for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets is primarily a result of reinvesting the proceeds of
matured short-term and fixed maturity investments into higher yielding fixed maturity investments. 

Investment income, excluding
net realized investment losses, and average annualized yields on the Company s average invested assets are as follows: 

*The
average is based on the beginning and ending balance of the amortized cost of the invested assets for each respective period. 

The par value, amortized cost,
fair value and weighted average yield of fixed maturity investments at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity are as
follows: 

Expected maturities will differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. 

The weighted average maturity of the Company s
fixed maturity investments was 1.1 years as of September 30, 2016, and 1.5 years as of December 31, 2015. Due to the
current interest rate environment, management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of
five years or less and with minimal credit risk. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had one fixed
maturity investment with gross unrealized losses of $79 for a continuous period of less than 12 months and no fixed maturity investments
with gross unrealized losses for a continuous period of more than 12 months. At December 31, 2015, the Company had three fixed
maturity investments with gross unrealized losses of $38,509 for a continuous period of less than 12 months and two fixed maturity
investments with gross unrealized losses of $6,115 for a continuous period of more than 12 months. 

The Company closely monitors its investments.
If an unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, it is written off as a realized loss through the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The Company s methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis
as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the
fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the debtor
is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments. The unrealized losses on the U.S. treasury securities
in unrealized loss positions as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were determined to be temporary. 

19  of 26  

Although the Company does not intend to sell
its fixed maturity investments prior to maturity, the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to
cash flow requirements, economic and/or market conditions. The Company sold three certificates of deposit prior to their maturity
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These securities had an amortized cost of $746,000. The Company realized an investment
loss of $1,278 on the sale. The Company did not sell any fixed maturity investments and there were no realized investment gains
or losses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, nor during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities are reported as  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), 
which is a separate component of stockholders  equity, net of any deferred tax effect. 

Other income,  included in insurance company
operation and other insurance operations revenues, decreased $1,827 (3%) to $67,147 and $104,900 (34%) to $207,427 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $68,974 and $312,327 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease from nine months ended September 30, 2015, to nine months ended September
30, 2016, is due primarily to $0 contingent commission recognized on Crusader s excess of loss reinsurance treaties for accident
years 2006, 2004 and 2003 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $91,686 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Gross commissions and fees  increased
$24,877 (4%) to $697,245 and decreased $2,153 (0.1%) to $2,063,429 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to $672,368 and $2,065,582 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The increases/decreases in gross commissions
and fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, are as follows: 

Unifax Insurance
Systems, Inc. ( Unifax ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sells and services insurance policies for Crusader.
The commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the consolidated
financial statements. Unifax also receives non-refundable policy fee income that is directly related to the Crusader policies it
sells. For financial statement reporting purposes, policy fees are earned ratably over the life of the related insurance policy.
The unearned portion of the policy fee is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under  Accrued expenses
and other liabilities.  The earned portion of the policy fee charged to the policyholder by Unifax is recognized as income
in the consolidated financial statements.    Policy fee income decreased $9,284 (2%) and $3,115
(0.2%) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015.   

American Insurance Brokers, Inc. ( AIB ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, markets health insurance in California through non-affiliated insurance companies for
individuals and groups. For these services, AIB receives commission based on the premiums that it writes. Commission income increased
$36,821 (17%) and $18,488 (3%) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases are due to increases in sales and a one-time adjustment of commissionable
base.  

20  of 26  

Insurance Club, Inc., dba AAQHC An Administrator
( AAQHC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a third party administrator for contracted insurance companies
and is a membership association that provides various consumer benefits to its members, including participation in group health
care insurance policies that AAQHC negotiates for the association. For these services, AAQHC receives membership and fee income
from its members. Membership and fee income decreased $2,608 (12%) and $8,031 (12%) in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were primarily
a result of a decrease in the number of association members enrolled in AAQHC during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the number of association members enrolled during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The daily automobile rental insurance program
was produced by Bedford Insurance Services, Inc. ( Bedford ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Bedford received
commission income from non-affiliated insurance companies based on written premium and continues to receive contingent commission
on previous business written. The Company no longer actively markets this program. 

Finance fees earned  consist of late fees,
returned check fees and payment processing fees. These fees earned by American Acceptance Corporation ( AAC ), a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, increased $701 (4%) to $18,450 and increased $1,937 (4%) to $50,667 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $17,749 and $48,730 in fees earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, AAC issued 783 and 2,405 loans, respectively, and had 2,435 loans outstanding
as of September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, AAC issued 822 and 2,605 loans, respectively,
and had 2,566 loans outstanding as of September 30, 2015. AAC provides premium financing only for Crusader policies produced
by Unifax in California. AAC reduced the interest rate charged on premiums financed to 0% beginning July 20, 2010, and, therefore,
did not earn any finance charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This reduction in the interest
rate charged was initiated in an effort to increase the sales of existing renewal and new business written by Unifax for Crusader.
Due to the low interest rate environment, the cost of money to provide this incentive is not material. The Company monitors the
cost of providing this incentive and, depending on the cost/benefit determination, can continue to offer it or withdraw it at any
time. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses 
were 101% and 77% of net earned premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 57% and
63% of net earned premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Loss ratio is calculated by dividing
losses and loss adjustment expenses by net earned premium. Losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss ratios are as follows: 

21  of 26  

Some
lines of insurance are commonly referred to as  long-tail  lines because of the extended time required before claims
are ultimately settled. Lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called  short-tail  lines.
It is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long-tail lines because of the long period of time that elapses between
the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim. Crusader s
short-tail lines consist of its property coverages, and its long-tail lines consist of its liability coverages. However, Crusader s
long-tail liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker than other long-tail lines not underwritten by Crusader, such
as workers  compensation, professional liability, umbrella liability, and medical malpractice. Since trends develop over
longer periods of time on long-tail lines of business, the Company generally gives credibility to those trends more slowly than
for short-tail or less volatile lines of business.   

The 85% loss ratio for the provision for insured
events of current year for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the 69% loss ratio for the provision
for insured events of current year for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was due primarily to an aberrational increase
in the frequency and severity of accident year 2016 short-tail property claims .   

The increases in the development of insured events of prior years of $2,095,411 and $3,471,683 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
were primarily due to higher than expected long-tail liability claims in accident years 2011, 2013 and 2015. 

While it is difficult to estimate adequacy of
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, historically, the Company was able to establish sufficient loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves to mitigate adverse prior accident year developments. 

The following table breaks out adverse (favorable)
development from total losses and loss adjustment expenses quarterly since March 31, 2014: 

The variability of the Crusader s losses
and loss adjustment expenses for the periods presented is due primarily to the small and diverse Crusader s policyholders
and claims population, which may result in greater fluctuations in claim frequency and/or severity. In addition, Crusader s
reinsurance retention, which is relatively high in relationship to its net earned premium, can result in increased loss ratio volatility
when large losses are incurred in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, management believes that its reinsurance retention
is reasonable given the amount of Crusader s surplus and its goal to minimize ceded premium. 

The preparation of the Company s
consolidated financial statements requires estimation of certain liabilities, most significantly the liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses. Management makes its best estimate of the liability for these unpaid claims costs as of
the end of each fiscal quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the Company s unpaid claims costs,
actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments are expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from any estimate made prior to
the settling of all claims. Variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, especially for
a small insurer like Crusader. For any given line of insurance, accident year, or other group of claims, there is a continuum
of possible loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates, each having its own unique degree of propriety or
reasonableness. Due to the complexity and the nature of the insurance claims process, there are potentially an infinite
number of reasonably likely scenarios. Management draws on its collective experience to judgmentally determine its best
estimate. In addition to applying a variety of standard actuarial methods to the data, extensive series of diagnostic tests
are applied to the resultant loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates to determine management s best estimate
of the unpaid claims liability. Among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are: loss and loss adjustment expense
development patterns; frequencies; severities; and ratios of loss to premium, loss adjustment expense to premium, and
loss adjustment expense to loss. 

22  of 26  

When there is clear evidence that the actual
emerged claims costs are different than expected for any prior accident year, the claims cost estimates for that year are revised
accordingly. If the claims costs that emerge are less favorable than initially anticipated, generally, the Company increases its
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves immediately. However, if the claims costs that emerge are more favorable than initially
anticipated, generally, the Company reduces its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves over time while it continues to assess
the validity of the observed trends based on the subsequent emerged claims costs.  

The establishment of loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves is a detailed process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim. Estimates
are based on a variety of industry data and on the Company s current and historical accident year claims data, including
but not limited to reported claim counts, open claim counts, closed claim counts, closed claim counts with payments, paid losses,
paid loss adjustment expenses, case loss reserves, case loss adjustment expense reserves, earned premiums and policy exposures,
salvage and subrogation, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid. Many other factors, including changes in reinsurance, changes
in pricing, changes in policy forms and coverage, changes in underwriting and risk selection, legislative changes, results of litigation
and inflation are also taken into account. 

At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company s
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for each accident year (i.e., for all claims incurred within each year) are re-evaluated
independently by the Company s president, the Company s chief financial officer and by an independent consulting actuary. 
Generally accepted actuarial methods, including the widely used Bornhuetter-Ferguson and loss development methods, are employed
to estimate ultimate claims costs. An actuarial central estimate of the ultimate claims costs and IBNR reserves is ultimately determined
by management and tested for reasonableness by the independent consulting actuary. 

Policy acquisition costs  consist of commissions,
premium taxes, inspection fees, and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the successful
production of Crusader insurance policies. These policy acquisition costs include Crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other
Unico subsidiaries. Crusader's reinsurers pay Crusader a ceding commission, which is primarily a reimbursement of the acquisition
cost related to the ceded premium. Ceding commission is received on excess of loss ceded premium, and no ceding commission is received
on facultative or catastrophe ceded premium. Policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission, are deferred and amortized as
the related premiums are earned. The Company annually re-evaluates its policy acquisition costs to determine that costs related
to successful policy acquisition are capitalized and deferred. These policy acquisition costs were approximately 22% of net earned
premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The policy acquisition costs increased in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to the increase
in the commission expenses associated with the increase in the net earned premium in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

Policy acquisition costs and the ratio
to net earned premium   are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits  increased
$63,655 (5%) to $1,318,622 and $310,975 (8%) to $3,980,055 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to salary and employee benefits of $1,254,967 and $3,669,080 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

23  of 26  

Salaries and employee benefits
incurred and charged to operating expenses are as follows: 

Commissions to agents/brokers  on the
Company s health insurance and daily automobile rental insurance programs increased $2,723 (7%) to $40,324 and decreased
$5,566 (4%) to $121,379 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $37,601 and $126,945
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other
operating expenses  decreased $1,294,313 (61%) to $826,519 and $1,498,722 (42%) to $2,052,771 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $2,120,832 and $3,551,493 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, respectively. The decreases in other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, are primarily related to $1,287,460 capitalized computer software costs
impairment that was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company did not have any capitalized
computer software costs impairment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other operating expenses include
costs incurred to review strategic alternatives and potential opportunities. These costs amounted to $139,270 and $346,890 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $87,076 and $89,076 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively . 

Income tax benefit  increased $695,095
(218%) to an income tax benefit of $1,013,225 (34% of pre-tax income) and $584,610 (132%) to an income tax benefit of $1,026,700
(34% of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, from an income tax benefit of $318,130 (33% of
pre-tax income) and $442,090 (32% of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The income tax provision
is primarily related to income before taxes. The calculated tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of
a federal tax benefit rate of 34%. The calculated tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of a federal
tax benefit rate of 33% and a state income tax expense rate of approximately 1%.
