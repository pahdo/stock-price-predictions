FIRST RATE STAFFING CORPORATION  

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS  

First Rate Staffing Corporation ( First
Rate  or  the Company ), formerly known as Moosewood Acquisition Corporation ( Moosewood ) was incorporated
on April 20, 2011 under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

The Company provides recruiting and staffing
services for temporary positions in the light industrial, distribution center, assembly, and clerical areas to its clients in California
and Arizona, with an option for the clients and candidates to choose the most beneficial working arrangements. 

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying balance sheet as of December
31, 2015, which has been derived from the Company s audited financial statements as of that date, and the unaudited financial
information of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, has been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of
management, such financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s
financial position at such date and the operating results and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the interim period
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. 

Certain information and footnote disclosure
normally included in financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant
to the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These unaudited financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 30, 2016. 

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

The summary of significant accounting policies
presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. Such financial statements and
accompanying notes are the representations of the Company s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in all material respects,
and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements. 

Use of Estimates   

In preparing these financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash   

The Company considers all highly-liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to this concentration of risk. 

Accounts Receivable and Factoring   

Accounts receivable are carried at the
original amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management
determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering each customer s
financial condition and credit history, as well as current economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed
uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $29,824 as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015. 

The Company entered into an accounts receivable
factoring arrangement with a non-related third party financial institution (the  Factor ). Pursuant to the terms of
the arrangement, the Company, from time to time, shall sell to the Factor certain of its accounts receivable balances on a recourse
basis for credit approved accounts. The Factor remits 90% of the accounts receivable balance to the Company, with the remaining
balance, less fees, to be forwarded to the Company once the Factor collects the full accounts receivable balance from the customer.
An administrative fee of 0.015% per diem is charged on the gross amount of accounts receivables assigned to Factor, plus interest
to be calculated at 0.011806% per day. The total amount of accounts receivable factored was $2,746,254 (unaudited) and $4,180,834
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date, based on the Company s principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific
asset or liability. 

GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy
of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: 

Level 1   Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access.   

Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including:   

Quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets   

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active   

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability   

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means   

Level 3   Inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). The Company did not measure any financial instruments on a recurring basis using significantly unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 30, 2016.   

Concentration of Credit Risk   

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. From time to time, the Company may maintain cash balances at certain institutions
in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. Historically, the Company has not experienced any losses on deposits. 

The Company s policy is to maintain
an allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customer to pay. However,
if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, the Company could
be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease operating income in the period that such determination was
made. 

Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment is presented at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Betterments, renewals, and extraordinary repairs that extend the life of the assets
are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization applicable to retired assets are removed from the Company s accounts, and the gain or loss on dispositions,
if any, is recognized in the statements of operations 

Equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 5 years. 

Intangible Assets   

The Company has intangible assets recorded
as part of a business acquisition (see Note 6). Intangible assets with definite useful lives, representing customer relationships,
are being amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives of 3 years using the straight-line method, which represents the
economic benefit pattern of the intangible assets. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

Long-lived assets, including intangibles,
are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that an asset may not be recoverable. The
evaluation requires that assets be grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the
cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges)
is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value and such loss is recognized
in income from continuing operations in the period in which the determination is made. The Company s management currently
believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance,
however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company s business model will continue. Either of these
could result in future impairment of long-lived assets. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company s revenue is derived
from providing temporary staffing services to its clients. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 605,  Revenue Recognition .
In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 

The Company recognizes its revenue from
temporary staffing services on a gross basis in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC 605-45 which outlines various factors
or indicators that assist in determining whether revenue should be recognized on a gross or a net basis. In connection with this
guidance, the Company believes the gross basis is appropriate, as the Company is the primary obligor in its arrangements and is
responsible for fulfilling the services being provided to the individual customers and for compensating the individual service
providers, regardless of whether the customer accepts the work. 

Cost of Revenue   

Cost of revenue consists of wages, related
payroll taxes, workers compensation, and employee benefits of the Company s employees while they work on contract assignment
as temporary staff of the Company s customers. 

Net Loss Per Share   

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
loss per share reflect per share amounts that would have resulted if diluted potential common stock had been converted to common
stock.  The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income Taxes   

Income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The likelihood of realizing the tax benefits related to a potential deferred tax asset is evaluated, and a valuation allowance
is recognized to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the beginning and end of the year; the change in the
sum of the deferred tax asset, valuation allowance and deferred tax liability during the year generally is recognized as a deferred
tax expense or benefit. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company evaluates the accounting for
uncertainty in income tax recognized in its financial statements and determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in its financial
statements. For those tax positions where it is  not more likely than not  that a tax benefit will be sustained, no
tax benefit is recognized. Where applicable, associated interest and penalties are also recorded. The Company has not accrued for
any such uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 creates a new topic
in the ASC Topic 606 and establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model, changes the basis for deciding when revenue
is recognized over time or at a point in time, provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics, and expands and improves
disclosures about revenue. In addition, ASU 2014-09 adds a new Subtopic to the Codification, ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred
Costs: Contracts with Customers, to provide guidance on costs related to obtaining a contract with a customer and costs incurred
in fulfilling a contract with a customer that are not in the scope of another ASC Topic. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is effective
for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Early application
is not permitted. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on determining management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. The guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 with
early application permitted. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial
statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU No. 2016-02 also will require
disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The standard will take effect for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is assessing
the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our financial statements. 

In March 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  The
Company is assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our financial statements. 

4. GOING CONCERN  

The Company has an accumulated deficit
of $1,268,633 since inception. This accumulated deficit is primarily the result of increased operating expenses associated with
professional fees necessary to complete its merger transaction and continue as a public company, as well as revenues historically
being at below break-even levels. Going forward, the Company expects these annual expenses to be lower. On February 11, 2014, the
Company also acquired the customer list of Loyalty Staffing Services, Inc. (see Note 6), which is expected to increase cash flows
from operations. Management believes this will allow the Company to operate at profitable level in the future. 

The Company anticipates that it will require
approximately $700,000 to $1.0 million to establish and fund its factoring facility. These amounts would be used to fund payroll
and taxes up to the point that these amounts are collect from the client. Factoring internally would mean self-financing, resulting
in a savings to the Company. No additional material or regulatory costs would be incurred at this point. Once the factoring entity
is successfully set-up, the Company expects to realize ongoing savings from the reduced factoring costs. 

The Company s continuation as a going
concern is dependent on management s ability to develop profitable operations, and / or obtain additional financing from
its shareholders and / or other third parties. In order to address the need to satisfy its continuing obligations and realize its
long term strategy, management s plans include continuing to fund operations with cash received from financing activities. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment consisted of the
following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Depreciation expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $3,409 and $1,665, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $10,284 and $4,995, respectively. 

6. ACQUISITION  

On February 11, 2014, the Company entered
into an agreement to purchase the customer list of Loyalty Staffing Services, Inc. ( Loyalty ), a California corporation,
for an aggregate purchase price of $1,444,363 consisting of a cash payment of $100,000, along with a $400,000 note payable, net
of a discount of $55,637 for imputed interest, and 500,000 shares issued of the Company s common stock, valued at the estimated
fair value of $2 per share. The total amount due of $500,000 was payable as follows; 1) $50,000 of the purchase price would be
paid within five days of the release of certain Uniform Commercial Code liens and personal guarantees, 2) an additional $50,000
would be paid sixty days from the date of such release, 3) the Company executed a promissory note to the seller for $400,000, payable
in four installments of $75,000 every six months after the closing date of the agreement, with a remaining and final payment of
$100,000 payable 30 months after the closing date. 

The
Company was in dispute with the seller of Loyalty, Nancy Esteban, concerning the terms of the cash portion and note payable portion
of the payout in the original transaction described above. The Company reached a settlement with Ms. Esteban on June 24, 2015.
In connection with the settlement agreement, the parties agreed to reduce the total note payable portion of the purchase price
from $500,000 to $425,000. Per the terms of the settlement agreement, the aggregate amount due of $425,000 is payable as follows;
$125,000 is due upon signing of the agreement, and the remaining $300,000 is payable in 30 monthly installments of $10,000 starting
in August 2015 through February 2018. The remaining balance due of this note payable amounted to $160,000 as of September 30, 2016
(see Note 9).  

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were
based on valuations using the income approach. 

The purchase price allocation was allocated as follows: 

Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, at fair value 

Intangible assets acquired represented
customer relationships which had an estimated useful life of 5 years. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded
an impairment charge of $640,733 to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets to their estimated fair value. The adjusted
carrying amount of the intangible assets after the impairment loss is being amortized over a remaining estimated useful life of
3 years. 

Amortization expense for intangible assets
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $22,710 and $73,293, respectively. Amortization expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $68,130 and $219,880, respectively. Estimated future amortization
of intangible assets, after taking into account the impairment loss of $640,733 described above, is as follows. 

7. ACCRUED EXPENSES  

Accrued expenses consisted of the following
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

8. NOTES RECEIVABLE   RELATED
PARTY  

The Company issued a series of unsecured
notes receivables due from an officer of the Company totaling $97,418 as of September 30, 2016 and $98,918 as of December 31, 2015.
Of the outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016, $38,500 of the amounts bear interest at 6% per annum, and the remainder of
the amounts are non-interest bearing. The amounts are due in 2018 at the following due dates; $31,918 is due March 31, 2018, $19,500
is due June 30, 2018, $7,500 is due September 30, 2018 and $38,500 is due December 31, 2018. 

9. NOTES PAYABLE   ACQUISITION  

Notes payable resulting from the acquisition
of Loyalty consisted of the following. 

Expected future maturity of long-term debt is as follows for
each of the years ended December 31. 

As the note payable from the acquisition
of Loyalty has no stated interest, the Company has imputed total interest of $55,637 using a rate of 10% per annum, which represents
the Company s incremental borrowing rate for similar transactions. The discount is being amortized into interest expense
using the straight line method, which approximates the interest method, over the maturity period of the note. During the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of the discount amounted to $1,486 and $1,486, respectively. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of the discount amounted to $4,458 and $11,463, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016, the note payable is presented net of a discount of $7,756. 

10. CAR LOAN PAYABLE   

In August 2015, the Company purchased a
vehicle for business purposes for an aggregate price of $49,612. The Company financed $37,612 of the amount over 72 months at an
interest rate of 13%. The balance outstanding as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $33,114. 

Expected future maturity of the car loan payable is as follows
for each of the years ended December 31. 

11. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES   

Leases     

The Company leases its
office location located in Phoenix, Arizona under an operating lease on a month-to-month basis at a monthly rate of $737. The Company
leases its offices located in Santa Fe Springs, California, Torrance, California and Ontario, California under non-cancellable
operating leases extending through December 2018.  

The following summarizes
the amounts due in future periods under non-cancellable operating leases.  

Contingencies    

The Company has determined it is eligible for reimbursement
of certain costs under its workers  compensation insurance policy that ran through May 2016. The Company is currently working
with its insurance carrier to determine the final recovery amount. No amounts have been recorded in the accompanying financial
statements related to the reimbursement as of September 30, 2016. The Company will record the reimbursement amount once the final
amount is known and all contingencies have been resolved. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

As used in this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,  except where the context otherwise requires, the
term  we,   us,   our  or  the Company  refers to the business of First Rate Staffing
Corporation. 

The following discussion should be read together with
the information contained in the unaudited financial statements and related notes included in Item 1,  Financial Statements, 
in this Form 10-Q.   

Overview  

First Rate Staffing Corporation ( First
Rate  or  the Company ), formerly known as Moosewood Acquisition Corporation ( Moosewood ) was incorporated
on April 20, 2011 under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

The Company provides recruiting and staffing
services for temporary positions in the light industrial, distribution center, assembly, and clerical areas to its clients in California
and Arizona, with an option for the clients and candidates to choose the most beneficial working arrangements. 

The Company s independent auditors
have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless the Company is able to
generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt as to the ability
of the company to continue as a going concern. 

On February 11, 2014, the Company entered
into an agreement to purchase the customer list of Loyalty Staffing Services ( Loyalty ), a California corporation. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

For a summary of our critical accounting policies, refer to
Note 3 of our unaudited financial statements included under Item 1   Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.    

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.  

The following is a comparison of the results of operations for
the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenues   

Our revenues decreased by $1,309,679, or
14.7%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues is due primarily
to certain large accounts that we ceased servicing in 2016 resulting from increased workers  compensation costs which made
them unprofitable to continue servicing. 

Cost of revenues   

Our cost of revenues,
which represent primarily staffing salaries and workers  compensation insurance costs, decreased by $996,400, or 12.6%, during
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of revenues is due to the decrease
in revenues for the period. The percentage decrease in cost of revenues was lower than the percentage decrease in revenues primarily
due to higher workers  compensation insurance costs in 2016 as compared to 2015. 

General and administrative expenses   

Operating expenses increased by $23,458,
or 3.2%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The slight increase was primarily
due to higher professional fees incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 associated with outsourcing its human resource
function to a professional employer organization, offset by lower amortization expense in the current year quarter. 

Interest and Other Expenses   

Interest and other expenses during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 included $69,740 of interest expense as compared to $66,965 compared to the same period in 2015.
Interest expense was consistent due to consistent amounts of receivables being factored during the two quarters. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.  

The following is a comparison of the results of operations for
the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenues   

Our revenues decreased by $859,253 or 3.9%,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Overall, our revenues have decreased due
to certain large accounts that we ceased servicing during the 2016 resulting from increased workers  compensation costs which
made them unprofitable to continue servicing. 

Cost of revenues   

Our cost of revenues, which represent primarily
staffing salaries and workers  compensation insurance costs, decreased by $687,188, or 3.5%, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of revenues is due to the decrease in revenues
for the period. The percentage decrease in cost of revenues was generally consistent with the percentage increase in revenue for
the period. During 2016, we outsourced our human resources and other employee management tasks to an outside professional employer
organization. While this resulted in higher costs initially, we ultimately expect the arrangement to result in decreased costs
and improved margins. 

General and administrative expenses   

Operating expenses increased by $266,695,
or 14.2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily related
to increased payroll costs associated with additional headcount compared to the prior year, as well as administrative costs and
professional fees associated with establishing the professional employer organization, offset partially by lower amortization expense
in the current year. 

Interest and Other Expenses   

Interest and other expenses during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $204,357 of interest expense as compared to $181,420 compared to the same period
in 2015. Interest expense was higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in overall accounts
receivables factored during the period. 

Promissory Notes  

The Company owes an aggregate total of
$160,000 to the seller of Loyalty, which is non-interest bearing and due in 30 monthly payment installments of $10,000 commencing
August 2015 through January 2018. 

The Company has a loan payable outstanding
for the purchase of a vehicle. The balance outstanding as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $33,114, which is payable in monthly
installments of $756 at an interest rate of 13% per annum over 72 months through August 2021. 

Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of
$90,924 and accounts receivable of $786,657. Our current assets of $877,581 were lower than our current liabilities of $1,465,399
by $587,818. 

The Company s proposed expansion
plans and business process improvements over the next two years will necessitate additional capital and financing. Accordingly,
the Company plans to raise between $2 million and $4 million of outside funding in the next year, for the purposes of funding its
own accounts receivable factoring company, establishing and operating its own worker s compensation captive unit, and acquiring
competitors and complementary service providers in its sector. Of this amount, the Company expects that it will need funding of
$1.0 million to $1.5 million to achieve its expanded growth and profit objectives in its existing core business over the next two
years. 

The Company anticipates that it will require
approximately $700,000 to $1.0 million to establish and fund its factoring facility. These amounts would be used to fund payroll
and taxes up to the point that these amounts are collect from the client. Factoring internally would mean self-financing, resulting
in a savings to the Company. No additional material or regulatory costs would be incurred at this point. If the Company were to
offer factoring to other entities (i.e. outside of the Company) then Company would be subject to all the rules and regulations
surrounding the operations of a finance company. Once the factoring entity is successfully set-up, the Company expects to realize
ongoing savings from the reduced factoring costs. 

The Company expects that establishing and
funding its workers  compensation captive will separately require funding of approximately $500,000 to $1.0 million, which
will include a substantial deposit to establish the captive as a self-insured funding unit. The costs include a deposit needed
of $500,000 or more, set-up costs of $50,000 to $60,000, and administrative fees of approximately $15,000 to $20,000 per year.
Legal requirements for the formation of a captive vary by state. Currently, Hawaii and Nevada offer the most favorable requirements
for establishing a captive for the Company. Any captive would still require catastrophic coverage beyond the normal coverage provided
by the captive. There are numerous companies which provide direction and assistance for establishing a captive, and the Company
would plan to engage such an advisory company. These companies are primarily responsible for ensuring that the captive meets the
regulatory requirements initially and annually in the applicable state of formation. These advisors also assist in risk assessment,
legal deposit requirements and claims administration. An impact on the Company s current business from the captive would
be the ability to retain the large deposit amounts required by insurance providers to remain in the control of the Company. As
with the factoring entity, once the workers  compensation captive is successfully set-up, the Company expects to realize
ongoing savings from the reduced workers  compensation costs. 

There can be no assurance that the Company s
activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital, or if additional capital is
needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company s
limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its contemplated business plans and operations
(including its goals of establishing a factoring entity and workers  compensation captive) unless it obtains additional financing
or otherwise is able to generate sufficient revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt
or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. 

The Company anticipates it will develop
a budget for marketing activities consisting of two levels of marketing: client marketing and acquisition marketing. Client marketing
costs are associated with sales staff with the single purpose to market to current and potential clients. Acquisition marketing
costs are those incurred for investor relations, traveling, expenses for client acquisitions, and case by case joint marketing
material for specific acquisitions as they occur. 

Liquidity  

To date, the Company has not suffered from
a significant liquidity issue. The main liquidity issue was addressed when the Company entered into new factoring agreements that
went into effect September 1, 2012 with TAB Bank, which provided for a $1,000,000 factor commitment. In addition, the Company may
borrow from time to time as available, sources of funds from its officers and/or directors as needed 

As the Company grows in size, the savings
from this new factoring arrangement will continue to accrue and enhance the Company s profitability and cash flow. Based
on this budget and the projected operations of the Company, there are no currently anticipated liquidity issues which would pose
a threat to the current business and operations of the Company. 

Net cash used in operating activities was
$382,502 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $21,707 for the same
period in 2015. The significant change between the periods was primarily the result of our net loss during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 being $498,190, as compared to a net income of $43,799 during the same period in 2015. 

Net cash provided by investing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,500 from the collection of outstanding notes receivable, compared to cash
used in investing activities of $51,530 during the same period in 2015, which represented payments for borrowings on related party
notes receivable of $64,030 offset by $12,500 in proceeds from the sale of a vehicle. 

We had net cash used in financing activities
of $93,114 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from the payments of $90,000 for the note payable due to the
seller of Loyalty and $3,114 from the payment of our car loan payable. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $147,464, which primarily represented payments on the note payable due to the seller of Loyalty. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

Information not required to be filed by
Smaller Reporting Companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures . 

Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal
executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer. There have been no significant changes in internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation,
they believe that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information
needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized and
processed timely. Both officers are directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company. 

The Company is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The Company s president and its principal financial and accounting officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on the criteria establish in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016,
based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

The Company has not made any changes during
its fiscal quarter that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

There are no pending, threatened or actual
legal proceedings in which the Company or any subsidiary is a party.

SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  

None.
