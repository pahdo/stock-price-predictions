      Table of Contents            GREENHOUSE SOLUTIONS, INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016        NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   :      Greenhouse Solutions, Inc. (the  Company  or  Greenhouse Solutions ), is a Nevada corporation. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 8, 2009. The Company was involved in the sale and distribution of urban gardening products and greenhouses on the North American Market, but is currently expanding the business into the development, marketing, production, and sale of hemp oil-enhanced products for both personal health use and canine use, in addition to probiotic-based nutraceuticals. As a nutraceutical company, the Company engages in the acquisition, licensing and commercialization of nutraceutical products and technologies.      Basis of presentation   Unaudited Financial Statements      The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.      Going Concern      The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit since inception of $4,332,158 through September 30, 2016, and has not yet established a minimal on-going source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.     The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan of providing financial consulting services on an ongoing basis. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.                  7       
      Table of Contents            NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Cash and cash equivalents      The Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.      Revenue recognition      The Company has realized minimal revenues from operations. The Company recognizes revenues when the sale and/or distribution of products is complete, risk of loss and title to the products have transferred to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, acceptance has been approved by the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions, and collection of any related receivable is probable. Net sales will be comprised of gross revenues less expected returns, trade discounts, and customer allowances that will include costs associated with off-invoice markdowns and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions and coupons. The incentive costs will be recognized at the later of the date on which the Company recognized the related revenue or the date on which the Company offers the incentive.       Basic and Diluted Loss per Share       The Company computes loss per share in accordance with  ASC-260,   Earnings per Share  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 there were warrants outstanding for 6,900,000 common shares. These warrants are not included in the diluted loss per share as the effect of the inclusion would be antidilutive.      Income Taxes      The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740. Under ASC 740 deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.     The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax asset. Greenhouse Solutions establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company s financial position and results of operations for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period under Federal tax laws.     Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change estimate.                  8       
      Table of Contents           Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets      The Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company s long  lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.     The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.     The Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review; (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company s overall strategy with respect to the manner of use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company s overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant decline in the Company s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.     The impairment charges, if any, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.        Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.      The Company s significant estimates include income taxes provision and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets; the fair value of financial instruments; the carrying value and recoverability of long-lived assets, and the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.     Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                  9       
      Table of Contents           Fair value of Financial Instruments      The estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash approximate their fair value because of their short maturities.      Office Furniture and Equipment      Office furniture and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated under the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. At September 30, 2016 the Company had computer equipment of $1,398 with corresponding accumulated depreciation of $443 which is being depreciated over 5 years. Depreciation expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $70 each respectively.       Long Lived Assets      In accordance with ASC 350 the Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack of recoverability, an impairment loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value.      Stock-based Compensation      The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to employees based on FASB accounting standard for Share Based Payment. It requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award   the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). It requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The scope of the FASB accounting standard includes a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans.     As of September 30, 2016 the Company had no stock-based compensation plans nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.      Recent pronouncements      Management has evaluated accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective as of September 30, 2016, and does not expect such pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, operations, or cash flows.              NOTE 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist. Representation about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of advances from stockholders due to their related party nature.     During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 a stockholder of the Company advanced a total of $23,760. In addition the Company incurred $27,500 in accounts payable to related parties. These payables represent compensation owed to these parties. These advances are unsecured, not represented by any formal loan agreement and bear no interest.       NOTE 4. STOCK ISSUED FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE       On September 23, 2016 the Company issued 503,245 shares of its common stock in settlement of $45,292 in accounts payable. The stock was valued at $0.09 per share which was the closing price of the stock on the date of approval and issuance of the shares. Since the valuation and the trading price were equivalent there is no gain or loss recognized.       NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDER S DEFICIT       The total number of common shares authorized that may be issued by the Company is 200,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The Company is authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As at September 30, 2016 there are no preferred shares issued or outstanding.     As at September 30, 2016 the total number of common shares outstanding was 95,784,458. The Company has an ongoing program of private placements to raise funds to support the operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the Company did not receive any proceeds through private placement activity.     In August of 2015 the Company received notice from an investor that they wished to rescind the transaction and have their money refunded. Since the shares had not been issued the refund is shown as a liability of the Company.     As at September 30, 2016 there were money s received for 662,000 shares that had not yet been issued.       NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES       A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the United States federal statutory rate of 34% and a Colorado state rate of 5% compared to the Company's income tax expense as reported is as follows:                The significant components of deferred income tax assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:         As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company s policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, and no interest or penalties have been accrued as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions. Current management believes that the last time a corporation tax return was filed was for fiscal year 2010. Management is currently taking the necessary actions to correct this deficiency. Due to a history of ongoing losses it is not expected that there would be any penalties or interest owed due to the non-filing status.     The tax years from 2011 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities       NOTE 7.  RESTATEMENT       In connection with the filing of a restated form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 there were certain adjustments made in each quarterly period during the fiscal year. Management has reviewed these changes for this current quarter and determined that the changes are not material. In the interests of clarity and information the following notes detailing the changes are hereby included:                       NOTE 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       Management has examined the activities of the Company subsequent to the closing date of these financial statements and had determined that there is nothing that requires disclosure.                   Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks.        This Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as "may", "will", "expect", "believe", "anticipate", "estimate, or "continue" or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships.      Based on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit totaling $4,025,111. This raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.       Plan of Operation       The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 8, 2009. The Company was involved in the sale and distribution of gardening products and greenhouses in the North American market. On September 2, 2009 we incorporated a wholly owned (ownership interest   100%) subsidiary Greenhouse Solutions, Inc. an Ontario, Canada based company to facilitate our operations and cross border goods transfer to and from Canada. We did conduct our operations in Canada through our Canadian subsidiary and our operations in USA through our parent corporation, Greenhouse Solutions, Inc. (USA). References in this Report to  Greenhouse Solutions  refer to Greenhouse Solutions Inc. and its subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Operations of our subsidiary were discontinued and sold on September 9, 2011.     We have shifted our focus to developing and selling hemp oil based nutraceutical products and have entered into a joint venture agreement with Koios, LLC to further those objectives. Under this joint venture, we have introduced a nootropic beverage, the KOIOS Raspberry Wonder with Hemp, to the market through various distributors.      We do not expect to generate revenue for the next 12 months, which would be sufficient to sustain our operations. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be dependent on additional financing in order to maintain our operations and continue with our corporate activities. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.       Results of Operations        For the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015      For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016, we had $0 in revenues compared to $Nil for the same period one year earlier. For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016, General and Administrative expenses were $550 as compared to $9,046 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $41,068 for professional fees compared to $10,352 for the same period in 2015. For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $25,500 for Management Fees paid to related parties compared to $23,500 for the same period in 2015. For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016 we incurred Corporate communication expense in the amount of $0 compared to $5,000 for the corresponding period in 2015. For the Quarter ended September 30, 2016 we incurred an operating loss of $67,188. This compares to the net loss of $47,968 sustained for the Quarter ended September 30, 2015. The difference in the overall operating expense increase for the Quarter ended September 30, 2016 is attributable in large part to the increased professional fees.             For the Six Months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015      For the Six months ended September 30, 2016, we had $0 in revenues compared to $Nil for the same period one year earlier. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016, General and Administrative expenses were $4,757 as compared to $28,036 for the Six months ended September 30, 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $48,367 for professional fees compared to $51,654 for the same period in 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $51,000 for Management Fees paid to related parties compared to $49,000 for the same period in 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred Corporate communication expense in the amount of $0 compared to $20,000 for the corresponding period in 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred consulting services expenses of $0 compared to $42,489 for the same period in 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred Research and Development expenses of $0 compared to $15,000 for the same period ending in 2015. For the Six months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred an operating loss of $104,264. This compares to the net loss of $206,319 sustained for the Six months ended September 30, 2015.     Our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to whether we will be able to continue to operate as a  going concern  due to the fact that the Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,332,158 as of September 30, 2016, and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.       Financing Activities       During the year ended March 31, 2016 the Company received $345,000 in private placement subscriptions for the Company's common stock and issued 2,350,000 shares which included shares for $90,000 which had been received in the prior year. As of March 31, 2016 there remained 137,000 shares which had been paid for but not issued. During the current year the Company issued 55,274 to a Related party for services rendered and authorized 1,178,939 shares for services rendered. Of these shares, 400,000 have not yet been issued. As of the date of these quarterly financial statements, a total of 537,000 common shares have not been issued.     On September 22, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved an issuance of 503,245 shares to Consultants of the Company for past services, and registered the shares pursuant to a Stock Option, Stock Compensation and Award Plan. Please refer to the Company s S-8 filed on September 22, 2016.     We intend to seek additional funding through public or private financings to fund our operations through fiscal 2017 and beyond. However, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, or achieve cash flow positive operations, we may have to significantly delay product development and scale back operations both of which may affect our ability to continue as a going concern.       Investing Activities       The Company had no investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       As at September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $Nil as compared to $4,318 at September 30, 2015. Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through the sale of shares of our common stock, third party financing, and/or traditional bank financing. We do not anticipate generating sufficient amounts of revenues to meet our working capital requirements. Consequently, we intend to make appropriate plans to insure sources of additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities.            The Company must raise additional funds in order to fund our continued operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds or achieve profitable operations. Even if we are able to raise additional funds through the sale of our securities or through the issuance of debt securities, or loans from our directors or financial institutions our cash needs could be greater than anticipated in which case we could be forced to raise additional capital. At the present time, we have no commitments for any additional financing, and there can be no assurance that, if needed, additional capital will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital when needed. If we cannot get the needed capital, we may not be able to become profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations.      Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      None       Item 3.
