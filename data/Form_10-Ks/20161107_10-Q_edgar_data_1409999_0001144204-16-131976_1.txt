DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS INC.  

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.    Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations  

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required
by GAAP for complete annual financial statement presentation. 

These condensed financial statements, as
of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly present the Company s financial position and the results of
its operations for the periods presented, in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for other interim periods or for the full year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. 

2.    Going Concern  

The Company s financial statements
are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet
established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The Company also has a working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets. The Company plans to continue
financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans. 

While the Company strongly believes that
its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s future activities will
generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such
funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

3.    Related Party Transactions  

As of December 31, 2015 the Company owed
EFT Holdings Inc. $570,000. Advances of $70,000 were received from EFT Holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
The amounts due EFT Holdings bear interest at 5% per year, are unsecured and are due in one year. 

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operation  

On February 18, 2010 the Company s
directors approved an agreement between the Company and EFT Holdings, Inc., ( EFT ), whereby EFT agreed to assign its
worldwide distribution and servicing rights to a product known as the  EFT-Phone  in exchange for 79,265,000 shares
of the Company s common stock. 

EFT markets its products through a direct
sales organization.  Once a customer of EFT s makes a minimum purchase of $600 (plus $60 for shipping and handling
fees), the customer becomes an  affiliate . 

The EFT-Phone is a cell phone which uses
the Android Operating System. The phone is manufactured by an unrelated third party. The EFT-Phone has an application that allows
EFT s affiliate base to access all of their back office sites including their Funds Management Account where the affiliate
is able to deposit, withdraw and transfer money to another EFT account or to another EFT Affiliate at no cost for the transfer.
The EFT-Phone has educational applications and PowerPoint presentation capability for training new affiliates anywhere in the world. 

The worldwide distribution and servicing
rights to the EFT-Phone include the right to sell the EFT-Phone to EFT s affiliates and others. Servicing includes the collection
of service fees for all EFT-Phones worldwide, including monthly fees, usage fees, as well as call forwarding, call waiting, text
messaging and video fees. The Company also acquired the rights to distribute all EFT-Phone accessories. 

Results of Operations  

The Company did not receive any orders
for the EFT phone during the year ended December 31, 2015 or the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company has been advised
by EFT that due to a significant drop in demand for the EFT phone, EFT has not placed any new orders with the Company. It is the
Company s understanding that EFT has inventory previously purchased from the Company and until sales increase, EFT will not
be placing any new orders from the Company. The Company is very concerned regarding this news and is investigating other sources
of revenue to mitigate its lack of revenue.   

Other than the foregoing, the Company does
not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that will have, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on sales,
revenues, expenses or results of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company does not have any firm commitments
from any person to provide the Company with any additional capital. While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources
will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues
to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be
obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

(a)           The
Company maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed
or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( 1934 Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its Principal Executive and Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s Principal Executive and Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Principal
Executive and Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

(b)            Changes
in Internal Control . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial
reporting.
