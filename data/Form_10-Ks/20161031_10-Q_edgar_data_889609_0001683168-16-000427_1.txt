(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   

Description of Business   

We were formed in California on March 8,
1991. We specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ( automobile contracts 
or  finance receivables ) originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers located throughout the United States ( dealers )
in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our purchases, we provide indirect financing
to dealer customers for borrowers with limited credit histories or past credit problems ( sub-prime customers ). We
serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, allowing sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain
financing. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired installment
purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans
from non-affiliated lenders, and (iii) lent money directly to consumers for an immaterial amount of loans secured by vehicles.
In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as  automobile contracts.  

Basis of Presentation  

Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and include all
adjustments that are, in management s opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.
All such adjustments are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature. Results for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted from these Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. 

Other Income  

The following table presents
the primary components of Other Income for the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Warrants  

In connection with the amendment to and
partial repayment of our residual interest financing in July 2008, we issued warrants exercisable for 2,500,000 common shares for
$4,071,429. The warrants represent the right to purchase 2,500,000 CPS common shares at a nominal exercise price, at any time prior
to July 10, 2018. In March 2010 we repurchased warrants for 500,000 of these shares for $1.0 million. Warrants to purchase 2,000,000
shares remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Stock-based Compensation  

We recognize compensation costs in the
financial statements for all share-based payments based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 718  Stock Compensation . 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $1.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively. These stock-based
compensation costs were $1.4 million and $3.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30,
2016, unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods equaled $11.5 million. This amount will
be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. 

The following represents stock option activity
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

At September 30, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic
value of options outstanding and exercisable was $10.8 million and $9.6 million, respectively. There were 127,350 options exercised
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1,033,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The total intrinsic value
of options exercised was $379,000 and $7.1 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There were 3.6
million shares available for future stock option grants under existing plans as of September 30, 2016. 

Purchases of Company Stock  

During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, we purchased 2.0 million shares of our stock in the open market at an average price of $4.05. 

During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015, we purchased 545,521 shares of our common stock, at an average price of $6.21. We purchased 468,948 shares of our stock
in the open market at an average price of $6.07. The remaining purchases of 75,573 shares were related to net exercises of outstanding
options and warrants. In transactions during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the holders of options and warrants
to purchase 392,200 shares of our common stock paid the aggregate $535,000 exercise price by surrender to us of 75,573 of such
392,200 shares. 

Reclassifications  

Some items in the prior year financial
statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or
total shareholders  equity. 

Financial Covenants   

Certain of our securitization
transactions, our warehouse credit facilities and our residual interest financing contain various financial covenants requiring
minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding
maximum leverage levels. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In addition, certain of our debt
agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the
respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only
if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Provision for Contingent
Liabilities  

We are routinely involved
in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our
legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication
that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. 

We have recorded a liability
as of September 30, 2016, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of
losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 provides cash flow statement classification guidance for certain transactions including
how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash
flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years
and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is assessing
ASU 2016-15 but does not expect a significant impact on its accounting and disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The revised accounting guidance will remove all recognition thresholds and will require
a company to recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost basis of a financial instrument
and the amount of amortized cost that the company expects to collect over the instrument's contractual life. It also amends the
credit loss measurement guidance for beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. This new accounting guidance will be
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions
of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(2)  Finance Receivables

Our portfolio of finance
receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated
for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a
homogenous portfolio. For key terms such as interest rate, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively
little variation from the average for the portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater
than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments
to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first
applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. 

The following table
presents the components of Finance Receivables, net of unearned interest: 

We consider an automobile
contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which
date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number
of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are
not included. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow
problems. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date
of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions
such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions
to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency
status of finance receivables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Finance receivables
totaling $36.3 million and $43.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, including all receivables
greater than 90 days delinquent, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. 

We use a loss allowance methodology commonly
referred to as    static pooling,   
which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical
and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred
credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. The estimate for probable incurred credit
losses is reduced by our estimate for future recoveries on previously incurred losses. Provision for losses is charged to our consolidated
statement of operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We establish the allowance for
new receivables over the 12-month period following their acquisition. 

The following table presents a summary
of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015: 

Excluded from finance
receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because
we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together
with the allowance for losses in repossessed inventory that is not included in the allowance for finance credit losses:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

3)  Securitization Trust Debt    

We have completed many
securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these
transactions is shown on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as  Securitization trust debt,  and the
components of such debt are summarized in the following table: 

_________________ 

(2)    Includes repossessed assets that are included in Other assets on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet.    

Debt issuance costs of
$13.4 million and $11.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, have been excluded from the table
above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on
our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

All of the securitization
trust debt was sold in private placement transactions to qualified institutional buyers. The debt was issued through our wholly-owned
bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by our other assets. 

The terms of the securitization
agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt and the warehouse credit facilities require that we meet certain
delinquency and credit loss criteria with respect to the pool of receivables, and certain of the agreements require that we maintain
minimum levels of liquidity and not exceed maximum leverage levels. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such
covenants. 

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

We are responsible for
the administration and collection of the automobile contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held
in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for the borrowings, to be applied to make payments on the securitization
trust debt or as pre-funding proceeds from a term securitization prior to the purchase of additional collateral. As of September
30, 2016, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $116.4 million. Interest expense on the securitization
trust debt consists of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing
include facility fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts on notes sold. Deferred financing costs and discounts
on notes sold related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using a level yield method. Accordingly, the effective cost
of the securitization trust debt is greater than the contractual rate of interest disclosed above. 

Our wholly-owned bankruptcy
remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries
issue the debt outstanding under our credit facilities. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that
the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries
have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax
purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries
are available to pay other creditors. 

(4)  Debt   

The terms and
amounts of our other debt outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below:  

Debt issuance costs of
$2.1 million and $2.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, have been excluded from the table above.
These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit on our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

of interest expense: 

(6)  Earnings Per Share   

Earnings per share for
the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were calculated using the weighted average number of shares
outstanding for the related period. The following table reconciles the number of shares used in the computations of basic and diluted
earnings per share for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

If the anti-dilutive
effects of common stock equivalents were considered, shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 would have included an additional 8.6 million and 7.7 million shares, respectively
attributable to the exercise of outstanding options and warrants. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2015, an additional 6.7 million and 5.8 million shares, respectively, would be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

(7)  Income Taxes    

We file numerous consolidated
and separate income tax returns with the United States and with many states. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S.
federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. 

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We do not anticipate that total unrecognized
tax benefits will significantly change due to any settlements of audits or expirations of statutes of limitations over the next
12 months. 

The Company and its
subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain
states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Deferred tax assets
are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized
for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively
verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $43.2
million as of September 30, 2016 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of
$43.2 million consists of approximately $34.8 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $8.4 million of net state deferred
tax assets. 

Income tax expense
was $5.1 million and $15.2 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and represents an effective income
tax rate of 41%, compared to income tax expense of $6.8 million and $19.9 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, and represents an effective income tax rate of 43% and 44%, respectively.

 Legal Proceedings 

Consumer Litigation. 
We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing
and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables,
and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. 

We are currently subject
to one such class action, which has been settled by agreement with the plaintiffs. The settlement remains subject to final court
approval. The court has approved the settlement, but an objecting member of the settlement class took an appeal of that approval.
The appeal was denied on October 18, 2016, and we expect the settlement to proceed as previously agreed. 

For the most part,
we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending
on the particular circumstances of each case. We have recorded a liability as of September 30, 2016 with respect to such matters,
in the aggregate. 

Department of Justice
Subpoena.  In January 2015, we were served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice directing us to produce certain
documents relating to our and our subsidiaries  and affiliates  origination and securitization of sub-prime automobile
contracts since 2005, in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice in contemplation of a civil proceeding
for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. We are among several other
securitizers of sub-prime automobile receivables who received such subpoenas in 2014 and 2015. Among other matters, the subpoena
required information relating to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile contracts and the representations
and warranties relating to those underwriting criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile contracts.
We provided responsive documents in March 2015, provided additional documents on September 30, 2016, and are unaware of any subsequent
material developments in the government s investigation, other than its initiation. The investigation could in the future
result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. No assurance can be given as to the ultimate
outcome of the investigation or any resulting proceeding(s), which might materially and adversely affect us. 

In General .
There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters referenced above. We have recorded a liability as of September 30,
2016, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including all of the matters described
or referenced above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on
such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies
we face, including those described or referenced above, as of September 30, 2016, and in excess of the liability we have recorded,
is from $0 to $250,000.

Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate
resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent
in contested proceedings, the wide discretion vested in the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies, and the
deference that courts may give to assertions made by government litigants, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution
of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may
be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability
imposed and the level of our income for that period.

 Employee Benefits 

On March 8, 2002 we acquired
MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger. We sponsor the MFN Financial Corporation Benefit Plan (the  Plan ).
Plan benefits were frozen June 30, 2001. The table below sets forth the Plan s net periodic benefit cost for the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We did not make any contributions to the
Plan during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We do not anticipate making any contributions for the remainder
of 2016. 

(10) Fair Value Measurements 

ASC 820,  Fair
Value Measurements  clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use
when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those
assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. 

ASC 820 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value
measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1
- inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level
2   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument; and level 3   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

Repossessed vehicle
inventory, which is included in Other assets on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using
level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At September 30, 2016 the finance receivables
related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $33.8 million. We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance,
of $24.1 million, which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 29%, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount
of $9.6 million. The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2015 was $12.8 million after applying
a valuation adjustment of $27.0 million. 

There were no transfers
in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We have no material
level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

The
following summary presents a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our financial
instruments. Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market
information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of our financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore,
significant elements of judgment were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among
other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which
are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts that will
actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Overview 

We are a specialty
finance company focused on consumers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, whom we refer to as sub-prime customers.
Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and,
to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and
passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to sub-prime customers of dealers. We
serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain
financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major
automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired
installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase
money loans from non-affiliated lenders, and (iii) lent money directly to consumers for an immaterial amount of loans secured by
vehicles. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as  automobile contracts.  

We were incorporated
and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through September 30, 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately $13.3
billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we obtained a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts
in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. In 2004 and 2009, we were appointed as a third-party servicer for certain
portfolios of automobile receivables originated and owned by non-affiliated entities. Beginning in 2008 through the third quarter
of 2011, our managed portfolio decreased each year due to our strategy of limiting contract purchases in 2008 and 2009 to conserve
our liquidity, as discussed further below. However, since October 2009 we have gradually increased contract purchases, which, in
turn has resulted in recent increases to our managed portfolio. Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are
shown in the table below: 

Our principal executive
offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit
and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our
Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. 

The programs we offer
to dealers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We purchase
automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions
in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities
to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. 

Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities 

Throughout the period
for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them
on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings
have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one
of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure,
these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or
as secured financings. 

When structured to be
treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile
contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities
issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. 

Since 1994 we have
conducted 71 term securitizations (generally quarterly) of automobile contracts that we purchased from dealers under our regular
programs. As of September 30, 2016, 17 of those securitizations are active and all but one are structured as secured financings.
Our September 2010 transaction is our only active securitization that is structured as a sale of the related contracts. From 1994
through April 2008 we generally utilized financial guarantees for the senior asset-backed notes issued in the securitization. Since
September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structures without any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our
securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year.
However, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January
2016. We also completed securitizations in April, July and October 2016. 

Our recent history of
term securitizations is summarized in the table below: 

From time to time we
have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored.
As of September 30, 2016 we have one such residual interest financing outstanding. 

Since December 2011,
our securitizations have included a pre-funding feature in which a portion of the receivables to be sold to the trust were not
delivered until after the initial closing. As a result, our restricted cash balance at September 30, 2015 included $102.1 million
from the proceeds of the sale of the asset-backed notes that were held by the trustee pending delivery of the remaining receivables.
In October 2015, the requisite additional receivables were delivered to the trust and we received the related restricted cash,
most of which was used to repay amounts owed under our warehouse credit facilities. Since we have changed the timing of our securitizations
to generally occur at the beginning rather than the end of the calendar quarter, there was no related amount of restricted cash
representing the pre-funding proceeds at September 30, 2016. 

Generally, prior to
a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities.
Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility
was established in May 2012. This facility was renewed in August 2016, extending the revolving period to August 2018, and adding
an amortization period through August 2019. In April 2015, we entered into a new $100 million facility, with a revolving period
extending to April 2017, followed by an amortization period to April 2019. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million
facility, with a revolving period extending to November 2017, followed by an amortization period to November 2019. 

Financial Covenants   

Certain of our securitization
transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios
and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels.
In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default
provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness
of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of September
30, 2016 we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

Results
of Operations  

Comparison of Operating Results
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 with the three months ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues .  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenues were $108.5 million, an increase of $14.5 million, or 15.5%, from the prior
year revenue of $94.0 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $14.8 million, or 16.3%, to $105.4 million from $90.6 million in the prior
year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries.
The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Servicing fees totaling $26,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $47,000, or 64.4%,
from $72,000 in the prior year. We earn base servicing fees on three portfolios and incentive servicing fees on one of those three
portfolios. All three of these portfolios are decreasing in size as we receive customer payments and, consequently, base servicing
and incentive servicing fees are decreasing also. The aggregate balance of portfolios generating servicing fees decreased to $143,000
at September 30, 2016 from $598,000 at September 30, 2015. 

In the three months ended
September 30, 2016, other income of $3.1 million decreased by $220,000, or 6.6% compared to the prior year. The three-month period
ended September 30, 2016 includes a decrease of $336,000 in revenue associated with direct mail and other related products and
services that we offer to our dealers and a decrease of $60,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid
by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. The decreases were somewhat offset by an increase of $66,000 in sales
tax refunds and a net increase of $110,000 on payments to us for our interest in certain sold charge off portfolios and acquired
third-party portfolios. 

Expenses .  Our
operating expenses consist largely of provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs, marketing and general and
administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile
contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated
subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are
received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance
market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include
base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding
stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options)
generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. 

Other operating expenses consist
largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and
advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses
were $96.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $78.3 million for the prior year, an increase of
$17.7 million, or 22.6%. The increase is primarily due the increase in our consolidated portfolio and associated servicing costs,
and the related increases in interest expense and in our provision for credit losses. 

Employee costs increased
by $1.4 million or 9.4%, to $16.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing 17.4% of total operating
expenses, from $15.3 million for the prior year, or 17.1% of total operating expenses. Since 2010, we have added employees in our
Originations and Marketing departments in conjunction with the increase in contract purchases. Since 2013, we have also added Servicing
staff to accommodate the increase in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees
by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the three-month periods ended, September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and administrative
expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities,
credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $6.3 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or
26.1% compared to the previous year and represented 6.6% of total operating expenses. 

Interest expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $6.0 million to $20.9 million, or 40.7% and represented 21.7% of total operating
expenses, compared to $14.8 million in the previous year, when it was 21.1% of total operating expenses. 

Interest on securitization
trust debt increased by $5.8 million, or 46.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. The average
balance of securitization trust debt increased 22.5% to $2,154.4 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $1,758.4 million at
September 30, 2015. In addition, the blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014.
As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 3.4%, compared to 2.8%
in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the
result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are
priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand
for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization
trust debt interest costs since June 2014, although that trend has reversed somewhat since July 2016. The blended interest rates
of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: 

Interest expense on subordinated
renewable notes decreased by $73,000, or 18.3%. The decrease is due to a decrease in the average yield on our subordinated renewable
notes to 8.9% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year when the average yield on our subordinated
renewable notes was 10.6%. In addition, the average balance decreased to $14.7 million for the three-month period ended September
30, 2016 compared to $15.1 million in the prior year period. 

Interest expense on warehouse
debt increased by $467,000, or 28.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. When possible,
we hold contracts with our own cash rather than pledging them to one of our warehouse facilities to minimize interest expense. 

The following table presents
the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the three-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)  Average balances
are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines o , which are based on daily balances.  

  (2)  Net
of deferred fees and direct costs.  

  (3)  Interest
expense includes deferred financing costs and non-utilization fees.  

  (4)  Annualized
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets.            

The reduction in the
annualized yield on our finance receivables for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period is
the result of our decision to offer dealers slightly lower acquisition fees and also to require slightly lower contract interest
rates on a portion of the contracts we purchase. 

Provision for credit
losses was $46.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $8.9 million, or 23.7% compared to the prior
year and represented 48.2% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit
losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for
establishing the allowance requires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables.
In addition, we monitor the delinquency and net charge off rates in our portfolio to consider how such rates may affect the allowance
for finance credit losses. Consequently, the increase in provision expense is the result of the increase in contract purchases,
the larger portfolio owned by our consolidated subsidiaries, and somewhat higher delinquency and charge off rates compared to the
prior year. 

Marketing expenses consist
primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a
salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers,
such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses decreased by $145,000, or 3.1%, to
$4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.6 million in the prior year period, and represented
4.6% of total operating expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased 14,706 contracts representing $242.1
million in receivables compared to 17,019 contracts representing $287.5 million in receivables in the prior year. In addition,
the number of employees in our marketing department decreased from 134 at September 30 2015 to 98 at September 30, 2016. 

Occupancy expenses increased
by $191,000 or 18.2%, to $1.2 million compared to $1.0 million in the previous year and represented 1.3% of total operating expenses.
In July 2015, we entered into a lease for additional office space in Irvine, California. We then occupied that space, and incurred
incremental occupancy expense, in phases. The first phase was in July 2015 and the second and final phase was in April 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased by $32,000 or 18.8%, to $202,000 compared to $170,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating
expenses. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $5.1 million, representing a 41.0% effective income tax rate. In the
prior year period, we recorded $6.8 million in income tax expense, representing a 43.5% effective income tax rate. 

Comparison of Operating Results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues .  During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenues were $314.1 million, an increase of $45.8 million, or 17.1%, from the prior
year revenue of $268.3 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $45.9 million, or 17.8%, to $303.7 million from $257.8 million in the prior
year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries.
The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Servicing fees totaling $73,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $210,000, or 74.1%,
from $283,000 in the prior year. We earn base servicing fees on three portfolios and incentive servicing fees on one of those three
portfolios. All three of these portfolios are decreasing in size as we receive customer payments and, consequently, base servicing
and incentive servicing fees are decreasing also. The aggregate balance of portfolios generating servicing fees decreased to $143,000
at September 30, 2016 from $598,000 at September 30, 2015. 

In the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, other income of $10.3 million increased by $63,000, or 0.6% compared to the prior year. The nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 includes increases of $367,000 in revenue associated with direct mail and other related products and services
that we offer to our dealers and an increase of $173,000 in sales tax refunds. The increases were somewhat offset by a net decrease
of $42,000 on payments to us for our interest in certain sold charge off portfolios and acquired third-party portfolios and a decrease
of $435,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic
payments. 

Expenses .  Our
operating expenses consist largely of provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs, marketing and general and
administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile
contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated
subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are
received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance
market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include
base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding
stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options)
generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. 

Other operating expenses
consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing
and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses
were $277.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $222.7 million for the prior year, an increase of
$54.3 million, or 24.4%. The increase is primarily due to costs associated with the increase in the amount of new contracts we
purchased, the resulting increase in our consolidated portfolio and associated servicing costs, and the related increases in interest
expense and in our provision for credit losses. 

Employee costs increased
by $4.6 million or 10.8%, to $47.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing 17.1% of total operating
expenses, from $42.9 million for the prior year, or 19.3% of total operating expenses. Since 2010, we have generally added employees
in our Originations and Marketing departments in conjunction with the increase in contract purchases, although more recently our
Marketing and Originations departments have not grown. Since 2013, we have also added Servicing staff to accommodate the increase
in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases
and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and administrative
expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities,
credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $18.2 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or
21.9% compared to the previous year and represented 6.6% of total operating expenses. 

Interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $16.7 million to $58.4 million, or 40.1% and represented 21.1% of total operating
expenses, compared to $41.7 million in the previous year, when it was 18.7% of total operating expenses. 

Interest on securitization
trust debt increased by $14.9 million, or 42.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. The average
balance of securitization trust debt increased 22.6% to $2,046.8 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $1,668.9 million at
September 30, 2015. In addition, the blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014.
As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 3.4%, compared to 2.8%
in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the
result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are
priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand
for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization
trust debt interest costs since June 2014, although that trend has reversed somewhat since July 2016. The blended interest rates
of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: 

Interest expense on subordinated
renewable notes decreased by $156,000, or 12.9%. The decrease is due to a decrease in the average yield on our subordinated renewable
notes to 9.3% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year when the average yield on our subordinated
renewable notes was 10.7%. The decrease in the yield offset an increase in the average balance to $15.2 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15.1 million in the prior year period. 

Interest expense on warehouse
debt increased by $2.4 million, or 54.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. We increased
our contract purchases to $873.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $791.3 million in the prior period.
However, when possible, we hold contracts with our own cash rather than pledging them to one of our warehouse facilities to minimize
interest expense. 

The following table presents
the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)  Average
balances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.  

  (2)  Net
of deferred fees and direct costs.  

  (3)  Interest
expense includes deferred financing costs and non-utilization fees.  

  (4)  Annualized
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets.  

The reduction in the
annualized yield on our finance receivables for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period is the
result of our decision to offer dealers slightly lower acquisition fees and also to require slightly lower contract interest rates
on a portion of the contracts we purchase. 

Provision for credit
losses was $134.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $28.3 million, or 26.6% compared to the
prior year and represented 47.7% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance
credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach
for establishing the allowance requires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables.
In addition, we monitor the delinquency and net charge off rates in our portfolio to consider how such rates may affect the allowance
for finance credit losses. Consequently, the increase in provision expense is the result of the increase in contract purchases,
the larger portfolio owned by our consolidated subsidiaries, and somewhat higher delinquency and charge off rates compared to the
prior year. 

Marketing expenses consist
primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a
salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers,
such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses increased by $617,000, or 4.7%, to
$13.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13.2 million in the prior year period, and represented
5.0% of total operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased 53,244 contracts representing $873.5
million in receivables compared to 48,046 contracts representing $791.3 million in receivables in the prior year. 

Occupancy expenses increased
by $658,000 or 22.3%, to $3.6 million compared to $3.0 million in the previous year and represented 1.3% of total operating expenses.
In July 2015, we entered into a lease for additional office space in Irvine, California. We then occupied that space, and incurred
incremental occupancy expense, in phases. The first phase was in July 2015 and the second and final phase was in April 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased by $97,000 or 20.5%, to $568,000 compared to $471,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating
expenses. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $15.2 million, representing a 41.0% effective income tax rate. In the prior
year period, we recorded $19.9 million in income tax expense, representing a 43.6% effective income tax rate. 

Credit Experience

Our financial results
are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such
as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted
average age of the receivables at any given time. In addition, in June 2014 we entered into a consent decree with the FTC that
required us to make certain procedural changes in our servicing practices, which we believe have contributed to somewhat higher
delinquencies and extensions compared to prior periods. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit
loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we originated or own an interest in as of the respective dates shown. The
tables do not include the experience of third party originated and owned portfolios. 

Delinquency, Repossession and Extension
Experience (1) 

Total Owned Portfolio 

____________________________________ 

  (1) All amounts and percentages are
based on the amount remaining to be repaid on each automobile contract, including, for pre-computed automobile contracts, any unearned
interest. The information in the table represents the gross principal amount of all automobile contracts we have purchased, including
automobile contracts subsequently sold in securitization transactions that we continue to service. The table does not include certain
contracts we have serviced for third parties on which we earn servicing fees only and have no credit risk.   

(2) We consider an automobile contract
delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may
have been extended within limits specified in the Servicing Agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days
payments are contractually past due. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not included. The delinquency aging
categories shown in the tables reflect the effect of extensions.  

(3) Amount in repossession represents
financed vehicles that have been repossessed but not yet liquidated.  

(4) Accounts past due more than 90 days
are on non-accrual.  

Net Charge-Off

  (1) All amounts and percentages are
based on the principal amount scheduled to be paid on each automobile contract, net of unearned income on pre-computed automobile
contracts.   

(2) Net charge-offs include the remaining
principal balance, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the vehicle (excluding accrued and unpaid
interest) and amounts collected subsequent to the date of charge-off, including some recoveries which have been classified as other
income in the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements. September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 percentage represents
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 annualized. December 31, 2015 represents 12 months ended December 31,
2015.  

Extensions  

In
certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In
general, an obligor would not be entitled to more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the
life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor s next due date by one month and extend the
maturity date of the receivable by one month. In some cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions
such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions
to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings.   

The
basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying the inevitable repossession and liquidation
or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the
loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension
include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor s account current (or
close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our
servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension.
In most cases, the extension will be granted in conjunction with our receiving a past due payment (and where allowed by law, a
nominal fee, applied to the loan as a partial payment) from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and psychological
commitment to the contract on the obligor s part.  

The
credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector s
discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the
reason the obligor has fallen behind in payment; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is,
have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's
past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor s willingness to communicate and cooperate
on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval
from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving
an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and
recognizing charge-offs.  

We
believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile
receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of September 30, 2016, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through
2014 (2016 extension data are not included at this time due to insufficient passage of time for meaningful evaluation of results):  

Table
excludes extensions on portfolios serviced for third parties.   

We
view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. For example, of the accounts granted extensions
in 2012, 61.6% were either paid in full or active and performing at September 30, 2016. Each of these successful accounts represent
continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases), where without the extension we likely would
have incurred a substantial loss and no interest revenue subsequent to the extension.  

For the extension accounts
that ultimately charge off, we consider any that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially
successful. For example, of the accounts granted extensions in 2012 that subsequently charged off, such charge offs occurred, on
average, 17 months after the extension, indicating that even in the cases of an ultimate loss, the obligor serviced the account
with additional payments of principal and interest. 

Additional
information about our extensions is provided in the tables below:  

Table excludes portfolios originated
and owned by third parties.

Non-Accrual Receivables  

It
is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our Servicing staff and
systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff are trained
to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their
payment obligations in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a
customer becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is not likely that the delinquency will be resolved and will ultimately result
in a charge-off. As a result, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due.  

If
a contract exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it
becomes less than or equal to 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, it would be restored to full accrual status
for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance
that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor s payment performance
and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold
is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would
again be reflected as a non-accrual account.  

Our
policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be
an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the
extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current).  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our
business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary
sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts,
amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), servicing fees
on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments
of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization
transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment
of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest,
occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,
if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no
assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash
will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related
spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire
and borrow against automobile contracts.  

Net cash provided by
operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $159.1 million, an increase of $21.1 million, compared
to net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 of $138.0 million. Cash provided
by operating activities is significantly affected by our net income before provisions for credit losses. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our net income excluding provisions for credit losses was $156.7 million, or $24.5 million more than our net
income excluding provisions for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $390.9 million compared to net cash used in investing activities
of $418.5 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and
other proceeds received on finance receivables held for investment and increases in restricted cash. Cash used in investing activities
generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables held for investment were $873.5 million
and $791.3 million during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $224.0 million compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $283.6 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance
of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on
our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. In the first nine months of 2016, we issued $980.7 million in new securitization
trust debt compared to $795.0 million in the same period of 2015. In addition, we repaid $625.5 million in securitization trust
debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to repayments of securitization trust debt of $490.0 million in the prior
year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net repayments on warehouse lines of credit of $112.7 million,
compared to net repayments of $9.9 million in the prior year s period. 

We purchase automobile
contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may
either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over
a period of years. As a result, we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts, and on
the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of
automobile contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. 

The acquisition of
automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial
overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing
need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the
required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and
their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of
those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. 

We are and may in the
future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of September 30, 2016, we had
unrestricted cash of $11.5 million and $216.3 million aggregate available borrowings under our three warehouse credit facilities
(assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of September 30, 2016 we had approximately $25.4 million of such
eligible collateral. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we completed three securitizations aggregating $980.7
million of notes sold. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level
that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations,
we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related
income could decrease. 

Our liquidity will
also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics
of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash
flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related
to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the
automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated
for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient
cash. Moreover, certain of our retained interests in securitization transactions and their related spread accounts are pledged
as collateral to our residual interest financing and cash releases from these transactions will be used to repay the financings. 

One of our securitization
transactions, our warehouse credit facilities and our residual interest contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum
financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum
leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions.
Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect
to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness.
As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. 

We have and will continue
to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2,176.3 million of debt outstanding.
Such debt consisted primarily of $2,073.4 million of securitization trust debt and $81.7 million of warehouse lines of credit.
Our securitization trust debt and our warehouse lines of credit have increased by $169.8 million, and $34.7 million, respectively
since September 30, 2015 (each net of deferred financing costs). As of September 30, 2016 our debt also included $6.9 million of
residual interest financing and $14.4 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are currently offering the subordinated notes
to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. 

Our recent operating
results include pre-tax earnings of $37.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $61.4 million, $52.2 million,
$37.2 million and $9.2 for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
Those periods were preceded by pre-tax losses of $14.5 million and $16.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that
our 2011 and 2010 results were materially and adversely affected by the disruption in the capital markets that began in the fourth
quarter of 2007, by the recession that began in December 2007, and by related high levels of unemployment. 

Although we believe
we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations
do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we
fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt
or equity securities. 

Forward
Looking Statements  

This report on Form 10-Q includes certain
 forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as  anticipates, 
 expects,   plans,   estimates,  or words of like meaning. Our provision for credit losses
is a forward-looking statement, as it is dependent on our estimates as to future chargeoffs and recovery rates. Factors that could
affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability
of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of automobile contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect
our ability to enforce rights under automobile contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels
of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels
of cash releases from existing pools of automobile contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase automobile contracts,
the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell automobile contracts to us on the
terms that we offer, and the terms on which and whether we are able to complete term securitizations once automobile contracts
are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified
personnel and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on notes issued in our securitizations). 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

We maintain a system of internal controls
and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our published financial statements and other disclosures
included in this report. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of such disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer (Charles E. Bradley, Jr.)
and the principal financial officer (Jeffrey P. Fritz) concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording,
processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, material information relating to us that is required to be included in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings   

The information provided under the caption
 Legal Proceedings,  Note 8 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I of this
report, is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

We remind the reader that risk factors
are set forth in Item 1A of our report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016. Where
we are aware of material changes to such risk factors as previously disclosed, we set forth below an updated discussion of such
risks. The reader should note that the other risks identified in our report on Form 10-K remain applicable. 

We have substantial indebtedness.  

We have and will continue
to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2,176.3 million of debt outstanding.
Such debt consisted primarily of $2,073.4 million of securitization trust debt and $81.7 million of warehouse lines of credit.
Our securitization trust debt and our warehouse lines of credit have increased by $169.8 million, and $34.7 million, respectively
since September 30, 2015 (each net of deferred financing costs). As of September 30, 2016 our debt also included $6.9 million of
residual interest financing and $14.4 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are currently offering the subordinated notes
to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. 

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely
affect our financial condition by, among other things: 

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our indebtedness, thereby reducing amounts available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;   

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry
in which we operate;   

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and   

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.   

Although we believe we are able to service
and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our
ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due could have a material
adverse effect. 

Forward-Looking Statements  

Discussions of certain
matters contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and as such, may involve risks and
uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which
we operate, projections of future performance, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision.
You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words  will,   would,   believe, 
 may,   could,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   assume 
or other similar expressions. Our actual results, performance and achievements may differ materially from the results, performance
and achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. The discussion under  Risk Factors  identifies
some of the factors that might cause such a difference, including the following: 

changes in general economic conditions;   

our ability or inability to obtain necessary financing, and the terms of any such financing   

changes in interest rates, especially as applicable to securitization trust debt;   

our ability to generate sufficient operating and financing cash flows;   

competition;   

level of future provisioning for receivables losses;   

the levels of actual losses on receivables; and   

regulatory requirements.  

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ from expectations due to many factors
beyond our ability to control or predict, including those described herein, and in documents incorporated by reference in this
report. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

We undertake no obligation
to publicly update any forward-looking information. You are advised to consult any additional disclosure we make in our periodic
reports filed with the SEC. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we repurchased 421,026 shares from existing shareholders, as reflected in the table below. 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

___________________ 

(1)    Each monthly period is the calendar month.    

(2)    Through September 30, 2016, our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to $54.5
million of our outstanding securities, under a program first announced in our annual report for the year 2002, filed on March 26,
2003. All purchases described in the table above were under the program announced in March 2003, which has no fixed expiration
date. Our board of directors in May 2016 increased the aggregate authorization by $10 million from $44.5 million to $54.5 million.
