     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
 Arlington Asset Investment Corp. ( Arlington Asset ) and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise provides, collectively, the  Company ) is an investment firm that acquires and holds residential mortgage-related assets, primarily comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ). The Company s investments in MBS include (i) residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise ( GSE ) such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ), which are collectively referred to as  agency MBS,  and (ii) residential MBS issued by private institutions for which the principal and interest payments are not guaranteed by a GSE, which are referred to as  private-label MBS  or  non-agency MBS.  
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The Company s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
 The Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Arlington Asset and all other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Although the Company bases these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and all other reasonably available information that the Company believes to be relevant under the circumstances, such estimates frequently require management to exercise significant subjective judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the previously reported net income, other comprehensive income, total assets or total liabilities. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Cash Equivalents 
 Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks, money market accounts and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 98% of the Company s cash equivalents were invested in money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Treasuries and other securities backed by the U.S. government. 
 Investment Security Purchases and Sales 
 Purchases and sales of investment securities are recorded on the settlement date of the transfer unless the trade qualifies as a  regular-way  trade and the associated commitment qualifies for an exemption from the accounting guidance applicable to derivative instruments. A regular-way trade is an investment security purchase or sale transaction that is expected to settle within the period of time following the trade date that is prevalent or traditional for that specific type of security. Any amounts payable or receivable for unsettled security trades are recorded as  sold securities receivable  or  purchased securities payable  in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Interest Income Recognition for Investments in Agency MBS 
   Substantially all of the Company s investments in agency MBS are classified as trading securities. On January 1, 2016, the Company elected to change its accounting policy for recognizing interest income on its investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities by amortizing purchase premiums (or accreting purchase discounts) as an adjustment to interest income in  
 5 
 
 ARLINGTON ASSET INVESTMENT CORP. 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  accordance with the  interest method  permitted by GAAP. Prior to January 1, 2016, int  erest income from trading agency MBS was reported based upon each security s stated coupon rate (referred to by the Company as the  coupon rate method ).  
 The interest method is applied at the individual security level based upon each security s effective interest rate. The Company calculates each security s effective interest rate at the time of purchase by solving for the discount rate that equates the present value of that security's remaining contractual cash flows (assuming no principal prepayments) to its purchase price. Because each security s effective interest rate does not reflect an estimate of future prepayments, the Company refers to this manner of applying the interest method as the  contractual effective interest method.  When applying the contractual effective interest method to its investments in agency MBS, as principal prepayments occur, a proportional amount of the unamortized premium or discount is recognized in interest income such that the effective interest rate on the remaining security balance is unaffected. 
 The Company believes that the application of the contractual effective interest method, relative to the coupon rate method, to its investments in trading agency MBS results in a reported interest income measure that better reflects the economic yield of its investments, including a better reflection of the economic effect of principal prepayments in the period in which those prepayments occur. In addition, the Company believes that this change in accounting policy enhances the comparability of its reported periodic financial results to those of its peers. 
 The Company retrospectively applied this change in accounting policy to all historical periods. Because the Company accounts for its investments in trading agency MBS on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value with all periodic changes in fair value reflected in the Company s net income, this change in accounting policy did not have an effect on the Company s historical consolidated balance sheets, net income, or comprehensive income. The change in accounting policy did, however, result in a reclassification between reported  gain (loss) on trading investments, net  and interest income on the Company s historical consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As the Company s agency MBS have generally been acquired at a premium to par value, historical reported interest income was reduced by periodic premium amortization, while periodic investment gains (losses) reported as a component of  gain (loss) on trading investments, net  were increased (decreased) by an equal and offsetting amount. The following table presents the effect of the Company s retrospective application of the change in accounting policy to the annual and quarterly periods of fiscal year 2015: 

Interest Income Recognition for Investments in Private-Label MBS 
   The Company s investments in private-label MBS were generally acquired at significant discounts to their par values due in large part to an expectation that the Company will be unable to collect all of the contractual cash flows of the securities. Investments in private-label MBS acquired prior to 2015 are classified as available-for-sale. The Company has elected to classify its investments in private-label MBS acquired in 2015 or later as trading securities. Interest income from investments in private-label MBS is recognized using a prospective level-yield methodology which is based upon each security s effective interest rate. The amount of periodic interest income recognized is determined by applying the security s effective interest rate to its amortized cost basis or reference amount. At the time of acquisition, the security s effective interest rate is calculated by solving for the single discount rate that equates the present value of the Company s best estimate of the amount and timing of the cash flows expected to be collected from the

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 (Unaudited) 
   
  security to its purchase price. To prepare its best estimate of cash flows expec  ted to be collected, the Company develops a number of assumptions about the future performance of the pool of mortgage loans that serve as collateral for its investment, including assumptions about the timing and amount of prepayments and credit losses.  
 In each subsequent quarterly reporting period, the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are re-estimated based upon current information and events. The following table provides a description of how periodic changes in the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected affect interest income recognition prospectively for investments in private-label MBS that are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities, respectively: 

Effect on Interest Income Recognition for Investments in Private-Label MBS 
 Classified as:  

Scenario:  

Available-for-Sale  

Trading  

A positive change in cash flows occurs. 
   
 Actual cash flows exceed prior estimates and/or a positive change occurs in the estimate of expected remaining cash flows.  

If the positive change in cash flows is deemed significant, a revised effective interest rate is calculated and applied prospectively such that the positive change is recognized as incremental interest income over the remaining life of the security. This revised effective interest rate is also used in subsequent periods to determine if any declines in the fair value of that security are other-than-temporary.  

A revised effective interest rate is calculated and applied prospectively such that the positive change in cash flows is recognized as incremental interest income over the remaining life of the security.  

An adverse change in cash flows occurs. 
   
 Actual cash flows fall short of prior estimates and/or an adverse change occurs in the estimate of expected remaining cash flows.  

The security s effective interest rate is unaffected. If an adverse change in cash flows occurs for a security that is impaired (that is, its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis), the impairment is considered other-than-temporary due to the occurrence of a credit loss. If a credit loss occurs, the Company writes-down the amortized cost basis of the security to an amount equal to the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate, and recognizes a corresponding other-than-temporary impairment charge in earnings as a component of  investment gain (loss), net.   

The amount of periodic interest income recognized over the remaining life of the security will be reduced accordingly. Specifically, if an adverse change in cash flows occurs for a security that is impaired (that is, its fair value is less than its reference amount), the reference amount to which the security s existing effective interest rate will be prospectively applied will be reduced to the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate. If an adverse change in cash flows occurs for a security that is not impaired, the security s effective interest rate will be reduced accordingly and applied on a prospective basis.  

Other Comprehensive Income 
 Comprehensive income includes net income as currently reported by the Company on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income adjusted for other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income for the Company represents periodic unrealized holding gains and losses related to the Company s investments in MBS classified as available-for-sale. Accumulated unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale MBS are reclassified into net income as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  upon (i) sale or realization, or (ii) the occurrence of an other-than-temporary impairment.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  

ASU No. 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)   
 
 This amendment makes targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying variable interest entity guidance.  
 
 January 1, 2016  
 
 This amendment did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30)   
 
 This amendment requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the associated debt liability rather than as a separate asset.  
 
 January 1, 2016  
 
 The adoption of this amendment resulted in an immaterial reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs from the line item  other assets  to the line item  long-term debt  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  

ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   
 
 This amendment defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. 
   
 ASU No. 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition with respect to financial instruments is not within the scope of ASU No. 2014-09.  
 
 January 1, 2018  
 
 The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-14 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10)   
 
 This amendment makes targeted changes to certain aspects of guidance applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendment primarily affects accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities measured under the fair value option, and certain financial instrument presentation and disclosure requirements. Accounting for investments in debt securities and financial liabilities not measured under the fair value option is largely unaffected by this amendment.  
 
 January 1, 2018  
 
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated financial statements.

ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)   
 
   This amendment replaces the existing lease accounting model with a revised model.  The primary change effectuated by the revised lease  
  accounting model is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for   those leases classified as operating leases.   
 
   January 1, 2018  
 
     The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU No. 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (Topic 323)   
 
 This amendment eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held.  
 
 January 1, 2017  
 
 The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)   
 
 This amendment was issued with the objective of simplifying several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities.  
 
 January 1, 2017  
 
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 606)   
 
 The amendments in this update require financial assets measured at amortized cost as well as available-for-sale debt securities to be measured for impairment on the basis of the net amount expected to be collected.  Credit losses are to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses, which differs from the direct write-down of the amortized cost basis currently required for other-than-temporary impairments of investments in debt securities.  This update also makes substantial changes to the manner in which interest income is to be recognized for financial assets acquired with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. 
   
 This update will not affect the accounting for investments in debt securities that are classified as trading securities.  
 
 January 1, 2019 

A prospective transition approach is required for investments in debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date of the update.  Accordingly, the effect of the adoption of this update on the Company's consolidated financial statements will depend, in large part, on the extent to which the Company holds available-for-sale debt securities as of January 1, 2019 (if any) for which other-than-temporary impairments had been previously recognized.    

ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   
 
 This amendment was issued to reduce diversity in practice with respect to eight various statement of cash flow reporting issues for which existing GAAP is either unclear or does not provide specific guidance.  
 
 January 1, 2018  
 
 The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have a material impact on the classification of cash inflows or outflows within its consolidated statement of cash flows.

    Note 3. Investments in Agency MBS  
 The Company s investments in agency MBS are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Substantially all of the Company s investments in agency MBS are classified as trading securities. The following table provides the fair value of the Company s available-for-sale and trading investments in agency MBS as of the dates indicated: 

Substantially all of the Company s investments in agency MBS represent undivided (or  pass-through ) beneficial interests in specified pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s portfolio of investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities also includes investments in inverse interest-only agency MBS with an aggregate fair value of $4,531. Each of the Company s investments in inverse interest-only agency MBS represents a beneficial interest in a portion of the interest cash flows of an underlying pool of pass-through agency MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans. 
   
 All periodic changes in the fair value of trading agency MBS that are not attributed to interest income are recognized as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following table provides additional information about the gains and losses recognized as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the periods indicated with respect to investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities: 

The Company also invests in and finances fixed-rate agency MBS on a generic pool basis through sequential series of to-be-announced security transactions commonly referred to as  dollar rolls.  Dollar rolls are accounted for as a sequential series of derivative instruments. Refer to  Note 6. Derivative Instruments  for further information about dollar rolls. 

Note 4. Investments in Private-Label MBS 
 The Company s investments in private-label MBS are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Investments in private-label MBS acquired prior to 2015 are classified as available-for-sale. The Company has elected to classify its investments in private-label MBS acquired in 2015 or later as trading securities. The following table provides the fair value of the Company s available-for-sale and trading investments in private-label MBS as of the dates indicated: 

As of September 30, 2016, the private-label MBS portfolio consists primarily of  re-REMIC  securities. The Company s investments in re-REMIC securities represent  mezzanine  interests in underlying, re-securitized senior class MBS issued by private-

  label Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit ( REM  IC ) securitization trusts. The senior class REMIC securities that serve as collateral to the Company s investments in re-REMIC securities represent beneficial interests in pools of prime or Alt-A residential mortgage loan collateral that hold the first ri  ght to cash flows and absorb credit losses only after their respective subordinate REMIC classes have been fully extinguished. The majority of the trusts that issued the Company s investments in re-REMIC securities employ a  sequential  principal repayment   structure, while a minority of the issuing trusts employ a  pro-rata  principal repayment structure. Accordingly, the majority of the Company s mezzanine class re-REMIC securities are not entitled to receive principal repayments until the principal balanc  e of the senior interest in the respective collateral group has been reduced to zero. Principal shortfalls are allocated on a  reverse sequential  basis. Accordingly, any principal shortfalls on the underlying senior class REMIC securities are first absorb  ed by the Company s mezzanine class re-REMIC securities, to the extent of their respective principal balance, prior to being allocated to the senior interest in the respective collateral pool. Periodic interest accrues on each re-REMIC security s outstandi  ng principal balance at its contractual coupon rate.  
 The prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans that serve as collateral to the underlying REMIC securitization trusts of the Company s private-label MBS had the following weighted average characteristics, based on face value, as of the dates indicated: 

(1)    
 
 Represents a  loss-given-default  rate.  Private-label MBS collateral pools which experienced no defaults within the three-month historical period are excluded from the loss severity rate calculation.    

(2)    
 
 Calculated as the three-month default rate multiplied by the three-month loss severity rate.    

Available-for-Sale Private-Label MBS 
 Periodic changes in the fair value of the Company s available-for-sale private-label MBS that are not attributed to interest income or other-than-temporary impairments represent unrealized holding gains and losses. Unrealized holding gains and losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income until the securities are sold. Gross unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income for the Company s investments in available-for-sale private-label MBS were the following as of the dates indicated: 

Upon the sale of available-for-sale private-label MBS, any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as a component of  investment gain (loss), net.  The Company uses the specific identification method to determine the realized gain or loss that is recognized in earnings upon the sale of an available-for-sale private-label MBS.

    The fol  lowing table presents the results of sales of available-for-sale private-label MBS for the periods indicated:  

Accretable Yield 
 The excess of the Company s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be collected over the security s amortized cost basis represents that security s accretable yield. The accretable yield is expected to be recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the security on a level-yield basis. The difference between undiscounted future contractual cash flows and undiscounted future expected cash flows represents the non-accretable difference. Based on actual payments received and/or changes in the estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected, the accretable yield and the non-accretable difference can change over time. Actual cash collections that exceed prior estimates and/or positive changes in the Company s periodic estimate of expected future cash flows result in a reclassification of non-accretable difference to accretable yield. Conversely, actual cash collections that fall short of prior estimates and/or adverse changes in the Company s periodic estimate of expected future cash flows result in a reclassification of accretable yield to non-accretable difference. 
 The following table presents the changes in the accretable yield solely for available-for-sale private-label MBS for the periods indicated: 

Other-than-Temporary Impairments 
 The Company evaluates available-for-sale MBS for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is less than its amortized cost at the quarterly reporting date, the security is considered impaired. Impairments determined to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a direct write-down to the security s amortized cost basis with a corresponding charge recognized in earnings as a component of  investment gain (loss), net.  An impairment is considered other-than-temporary when (i) the Company intends to sell the impaired security, (ii) the Company more-likely-than not will be required to sell the impaired security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (iii) a credit loss exists. A credit loss exists when the present value of the Company s estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security, discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate, is less than the security s amortized cost basis. 
 If the Company intends to sell an impaired security or it more-likely-than-not will be required to sell an impaired security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company writes-down the amortized cost basis of the security to an amount equal to the security s fair value and recognizes a corresponding other-than-temporary impairment charge in earnings as a component of  investment gain (loss), net.  If a credit loss exists for an impaired security that the Company does not intend to sell nor will it likely be required to sell prior to recovery, the Company writes-down the amortized cost basis of the security to an amount equal to the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate, and recognizes a corresponding other-than-temporary impairment charge in earnings as a component of  investment gain (loss), net.  
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded credit related other-than-temporary impairment charges of $-0- and $1,737, respectively, as a component of  investment gains (loss), net  on the consolidated statements

Trading Private-Label MBS 
 Periodic changes in the fair value of investments in trading private-label MBS that are not attributable to interest income are recognized as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following table provides additional information about the gains and losses recognized as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  for the periods indicated with respect to investments in private-label MBS classified as trading securities: 

Note 5. Borrowings 
 Repurchase Agreements 
 The Company finances the purchase of MBS through repurchase agreements, which are accounted for as collateralized borrowing arrangements. In a repurchase transaction, the Company sells MBS to a counterparty under a master repurchase agreement in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to repurchase the same security at a future date in an amount equal to the cash initially exchanged plus an agreed-upon amount of interest. MBS sold under agreements to repurchase remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheets because the Company maintains effective control over such securities throughout the duration of the arrangement. Throughout the contractual term of a repurchase agreement, the Company recognizes a  repurchase agreement  liability on its consolidated balance sheets to reflect the obligation to repay to the counterparty the proceeds received upon the initial transfer of the MBS. The difference between the proceeds received by the Company upon the initial transfer of the MBS and the contractually agreed-upon repurchase price is recognized as interest expense over the term of the repurchase arrangement on a level-yield basis. 
 Amounts borrowed pursuant to repurchase agreements are equal in value to a specified percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral. The Company retains beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral throughout the term of the repurchase agreement. The counterparty to the repurchase agreements may require that the Company pledge additional securities or cash as additional collateral to secure borrowings when the value of the collateral declines.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
 In September 2015, the Company s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Key Bridge Insurance, LLC ( Key Bridge ), was granted membership to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLBC ). The FHLBC, like each of the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (collectively, the  FHLB ), is a cooperative that provides its member financial institutions with a number of financial products and services, including short and long-term secured borrowings that are known as  advances.  FHLBC advances may be collateralized by a number of real estate related assets, including agency MBS. As a member of the FHLBC, Key Bridge is required to acquire membership stock as well as activity-based stock (the amount of which is based upon a percentage of the dollar amount of its outstanding advances) in the FHLBC. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Key Bridge held $2 and $15,740 of capital stock in the FHLBC, respectively, which is included in  other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Similar to a repurchase agreement borrowing, the Company pledged agency MBS as collateral to secure the advance to Key Bridge, the amount of which is equal to a specified percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral. The Company retained beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral throughout the term of the advance arrangement. The FHLBC held the right to require that the Company pledge additional collateral to secure borrowings when the value of the collateral declined.

    On January 12, 2016, the regulator of the FHLB system, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ), released a final rule that amends regulations governing FHLB membership, including an amendment which prevents captive insurance companies from being eligib  le for FHLB membership. Under the terms of the final rule, Key Bridge is required to terminate its membership and repay its existing advances within one year following the final rule s effective date of February 19, 2016. In addition, Key Bridge is prohibi  ted from obtaining new advances during the one year transition period.   During the first quarter of    2016  , the Company repaid all of its outstanding FHLBC advances, funded primarily through proceeds obtained from traditional repurchase agreement financing a  rrangements.   
 The following table provides information regarding the Company s outstanding FHLB advances as of the date indicated: 

(1)    
 
 Net amount represents the value of collateral in excess of corresponding FHLB advance. The amount of collateral at-risk is limited to the outstanding FHLB advance and not the entire collateral balance.    

 Long-Term Debt 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $73,601 and $73,433, respectively, of outstanding long-term debentures, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1,699 and $1,867, respectively. The Company s long-term debentures consisted of the following as of the dates indicated: 

On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a public offering of $35,300 of 6.75% Senior Notes due in 2025 and received net proceeds of $34,063 after payment of underwriting discounts, commissions, and expenses. 
 The Senior Notes due 2023 and the Senior Notes due 2025 are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols  AIW  and  AIC,  respectively. The Senior Notes due 2023 and Senior Notes due 2025 may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the Company s option on or after May 1, 2016 and March 15, 2018, respectively, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing these Senior Notes contains certain covenants, including limitations on the Company s ability to merge or consolidate with other entities or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company s assets. 

Note 6. Derivative Instruments 
   In the normal course of its operations, the Company is a party to financial instruments that are accounted for as derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either  derivative assets  or  derivative liabilities  in the consolidated

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  balance sheets, with all periodic changes in fair value reflected as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Cash receipts or payments related to derivative instruments are classified   a  s   investing   activities     within   the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
 Types and Uses of Derivative Instruments 
 Interest Rate Derivatives 
 Most of the Company s derivative instruments are interest rate derivatives that are intended to economically hedge changes, attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates, in certain MBS fair values and future interest cash flows on the Company s short-term financing arrangements. Interest rate derivatives include centrally cleared interest rate swaps as well as exchange-traded instruments, such as Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures, U.S. Treasury note futures, and options on futures. While the Company uses its interest rate derivatives to economically hedge a portion of its interest rate risk, it has not designated such contracts as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes. 
 The Company exchanges collateral with the counterparties to its interest rate derivative instruments at least on a daily basis based upon daily changes in fair value (also known as  variation margin ) as measured by the central clearinghouse through which those derivatives are cleared. In addition, the central clearinghouse requires market participants to deposit and maintain an  initial margin  amount which is determined by the clearinghouse and is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the clearinghouse from the maximum estimated single-day price movement in that market participant s contracts. Cash initial and variation margin posted by the Company in respect of interest rate derivatives is included in the line item  deposits  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 To-Be-Announced Agency MBS Transactions, Including  Dollar Rolls  
 In addition to interest rate derivatives that are used for interest rate risk management, the Company is a party to derivative instruments that economically serve as investments, such as forward contracts to purchase or sell fixed-rate  pass-through  agency MBS on a non-specified pool basis, which are known as to-be-announced ( TBA ) contracts. A TBA contract is a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a fixed-rate agency MBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon, and stated maturity on an agreed upon future date. The specific agency MBS that will be delivered to satisfy the TBA trade is not known at the inception of the trade. The Company accounts for TBA contracts as derivative instruments because the Company cannot assert that it is probable at inception and throughout the term of an individual TBA contract that its settlement will result in physical delivery of the underlying agency MBS, or the individual TBA contract will not settle in the shortest time period possible. 
 The Company s agency MBS investment portfolio includes net purchase (or  net long ) positions in TBA securities, which are primarily the result of executing sequential series of  dollar roll  transactions. The Company executes dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing non-specified fixed-rate agency MBS. Such transactions involve effectively delaying (or  rolling ) the settlement of a forward purchase of a TBA agency MBS by entering into an offsetting sale prior to the settlement date, net settling the  paired-off  positions in cash, and contemporaneously entering another forward purchase of a TBA agency MBS of the same characteristics for a later settlement date. TBA securities purchased or sold for a forward settlement month are generally priced at a discount relative to TBA securities purchased for settlement in the current month. This discount, often referred to as the dollar roll  price drop,  reflects compensation for the net interest income (interest income less financing costs) that is foregone as a result of relinquishing beneficial ownership of the MBS for the duration of the dollar roll (also known as  dollar roll income ). By executing a sequential series of dollar roll transactions, the Company is able to create the economic experience of investing in an agency MBS, financed with a repurchase agreement, over a period of time. Forward purchases and sales of TBA securities are accounted for as derivative instruments in the Company s financial statements. Accordingly, dollar roll income is recognized as a component of  investment gains (losses), net  along with all other periodic changes in the fair value of TBA commitments. 
 Cash collateral posted by the Company with respect to TBA transactions is included in the line item  deposits  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 In addition to TBA transactions, the Company may, from time to time, enter into commitments to purchase or sell specified agency MBS that do not qualify as regular-way security trades. Such commitments are also accounted for as derivative instruments.

Options on 10-year U.S. Treasury Note Futures 
 The Company has purchased and sold exchange-traded options on U.S. Treasury note futures contracts as of September 30, 2016 with the objective of hedging a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of the Company s agency MBS portfolio.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company holds put options which provide the Company with the right to sell 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures to a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $600 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 1.71%.  In addition, the Company has sold, or written, call options that provide a counterparty with the option to buy 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from the Company with an equivalent notional amount of $600 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 1.39%.  In order to limit its exposure on the sold call options from a significant decline in long-term interest rates, the Company also purchased contracts that provide the Company with the option to buy 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $300 million as of September 30, 2016 that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 1.07%.  The options may be exercised at any time prior to their expiry, which occurs in the fourth quarter of 2016, and, if exercised, will be net settled in cash.  Information about the Company s outstanding put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures contracts as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The accounting principles related to fair value measurements define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below: 

Level 1 Inputs -   
 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company at the measurement date;  

Level 2 Inputs -   
 
 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and  

Level 3 Inputs -   
 
 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including significant judgments made by the Company about the assumptions that a market participant would use.  

The Company measures the fair value of the following assets and liabilities: 
 Mortgage-backed securities 
   Agency MBS  - The Company s investments in agency MBS are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to fair value measurements of the Company s investments in agency MBS include price estimates obtained from third-party pricing services. The inputs used in the fair value measurements performed by the third-party pricing services are based upon readily   
 22 
 
 ARLINGTON ASSET INVESTMENT CORP. 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  observable transactions for securities with similar characteristics (such as issuer/guarantor, coupon rate, stated maturity, and   collateral   pool characteristics) occurring on the measuremen  t date. The Company makes inquiries of the third party pricing sources to understand the significant inputs and assumptions used to determine prices. The Company reviews the various third-party fair value estimates and performs procedures to validate their   reasonableness, including comparison to recent trading activity for similar securities and an overall review for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date.  
 Private-label MBS  - The Company s investments in private-label MBS are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as private-label MBS trade infrequently and, therefore, the measurement of their fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses an income approach as well as market approaches. The Company utilizes present value techniques based on the estimated future cash flows of the instrument taking into consideration various assumptions derived by management based on their observations of assumptions used by market participants. These assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as historical collateral performance data, evaluation of historical collateral performance data for other securities with comparable or similar risk characteristics, and observed completed or pending transactions in similar instruments, when available. The significant inputs to the Company s valuation process include collateral default, loss severity, prepayment, and discount rates (i.e., the rate of return demanded by market participants as of the measurement date). In general, significant increases (decreases) in default, loss severity, or discount rate assumptions, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. However, significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rate assumptions, in isolation, may result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement depending upon the instrument s specific characteristics and the overall payment structure of the issuing securitization vehicle. It is difficult to generalize the interrelationships between these significant inputs as the actual results could differ considerably on an individual security basis. Therefore, each significant input is closely analyzed to ascertain its reasonableness for the Company s purposes of fair value measurement.  
 Measuring fair value is inherently subjective given the volatile and sometimes illiquid markets for these private-label MBS and requires management to make a number of judgments about the assumptions that a market participant would use, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows as well as the rate of return required by market participants. The assumptions the Company applies are specific to each security. Although the Company relies on its internal calculations to estimate the fair value of these private-label MBS, the Company considers indications of value from actual sales of similar private-label MBS to assist in the valuation process and to calibrate the Company s models. 
 Derivative instruments 
 Exchange-traded derivative instruments  - Exchange-traded derivative instruments, which include Eurodollar futures, U.S. Treasury note futures, interest rate swap futures, and options on futures, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are measured using quoted prices for identical instruments in liquid markets.  
 Centrally cleared interest rate swaps  - Centrally cleared interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of centrally cleared interest rate swaps are measured using the daily valuations reported by the clearinghouse through which the instrument was cleared. In performing its end-of-day valuations, the clearinghouse constructs forward interest rate curves (for example, three-month LIBOR forward rates) from its specific observations of that day s trading activity. The clearinghouse uses the applicable forward interest rate curve to develop a market-based forecast of future remaining contractually required cash flows for each interest rate swap. Each market-based cash flow forecast is then discounted using the overnight index swap rate curve (sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) to determine a net present value amount which represents the instrument s fair value. The Company reviews the valuations reported by the clearinghouse on an ongoing basis and performs procedures using readily available market data to independently verify their reasonableness.  
 Forward-settling purchases and sales of TBA securities    Forward-settling purchases and sales of TBA securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of each forward-settling TBA contract is measured using broker or dealer quotations, which are based upon readily observable transaction prices occurring on the measurement date for forward-settling contracts to buy or sell TBA securities with the same guarantor, contractual maturity, and coupon rate for delivery on the same forward settlement date as the contract under measurement.

    Other  
 Long-term debt  - As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company s long-term debt was $73,601 and $73,433, respectively, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and consists of Senior Notes and trust preferred debt issued by the Company. The Company s estimate of the fair value of long-term debt is $68,029 and $59,130 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s Senior Notes, which are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Trust preferred debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is estimated based on the quoted prices of the Company s publicly traded Senior Notes.  
 FHLBC capital stock  - FHLBC capital stock is initially purchased at par and may only be transferred back to the FHLBC or to another FHLBC member, subject to approval by the FHLBC, also at par. Due to the restrictions placed on transferability, it is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLBC capital stock. The par value and carrying amount of the FHLBC capital stock included in the line item  other assets  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets is $2 and $15,740 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Investments in equity securities of non-public companies and investment funds  - As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had investments in equity securities and investment funds with a carrying amount of $2,004 and $1,558, respectively, which are included in the line item  other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  As of September 30, 2016, $619 of these investments represent securities for which the Company elected the  fair value option  at the time that the securities were initially recognized on the Company s consolidated balance sheets; the Company measures the fair value of these securities on a recurring basis, recognizing the periodic change in fair value in earnings.  The remaining $1,385 in investments in equity securities of non-public companies and investment funds as of September 30, 2016, and the entire population of such securities as of December 31, 2015, were measured at cost, net of impairments.  The Company s estimate of the fair value of investments in equity securities and investment funds is $5,916 and $5,989 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Investments in equity securities and investment funds are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Company s investments in equity securities and investment funds are not readily determinable. Accordingly, for its investments in equity securities, the Company estimates fair value by estimating the enterprise value of the investee and then waterfalls the enterprise value over the investee s securities in the order of their preference relative to one another. To estimate the enterprise value of the investee, the Company uses traditional valuation methodologies, including recent investments in, or tender offers for, the equity securities of the investee. For its investments in investment funds, the Company estimates fair value based upon the investee s net asset value per share.  
 Financial assets and liabilities for which carrying value approximates fair value  - Cash and cash equivalents, deposits, receivables, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, payables, and other assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at their cost, which, due to the short-term nature of these instruments and their limited inherent credit risk, approximates fair value.

    Share Repurchase Program  
   
 In October 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (the  Repurchase Program ). Repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions at management s discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of Class A common stock to be repurchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program is funded using the Company s cash on hand and cash generated from operations. The Repurchase Program has no expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of September 30, 2016, there remain available for repurchase 1,951,305 shares of Class A common stock under the Repurchase Program. 
   
 Shareholder Rights Agreement 
   
 The Board of Directors adopted and the Company s shareholders approved a shareholder rights agreement ( Rights Plan ). Under the terms of the Rights Plan, in general, if a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer for beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock upon a determination by our Board of Directors (an  Acquiring Person ), all of our other Class A and Class B common shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a discount to such securities  fair market value, thus causing substantial dilution to the Acquiring Person. 
   
 The Board of Directors adopted the Rights Plan in an effort to protect against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use its NOL carry-forwards, NCL carry-forwards, and built-in losses under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. The Company s ability to use its NOLs, NCLs and built-in losses would be limited if it experienced an  ownership change  under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an  ownership change  would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of the Company s common stock of more than 50% by one or more  5% shareholders  during a three-year period. The Rights Plan was adopted to dissuade any person or group from acquiring 4.9% or more of the Company s outstanding Class A common stock, each, an Acquiring Person, without the approval of the Board of Directors and triggering an  ownership change  as defined by Section 382. 
   
 The Rights Plan and any outstanding rights will expire at the earliest of (i) June 4, 2019, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the Rights Plan, (iii) the repeal of Section 382 and 383 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board of Directors determines that the Rights Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the applicable tax benefits, and (iv) the beginning of a taxable year to which the Board of Directors determines that no applicable tax benefits may be carried forward.

 Our Company 
   
 We are a principal investment firm that currently acquires and holds a levered portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ), consisting of agency MBS and private-label MBS. Agency MBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or government sponsored enterprise ( GSE ), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ). Private-label MBS, or non-agency MBS, include residential MBS that are not guaranteed by a GSE or the U.S. government. 
   
 We leverage prudently our investment portfolio so as to increase potential returns to our shareholders. We fund our investments primarily through short-term financing arrangements, principally through repurchase agreements.  We enter into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of our cost of borrowing and the value of our MBS portfolio. 
   
 We are a Virginia corporation and taxed as a C corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. We are an internally managed company and do not have an external investment advisor. 
 Factors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 Our business is materially affected by a variety of industry and economic factors, including: 

conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally;     

changes in interest rates and prepayment rates;     

condition in the residential real estate and mortgage markets;     

actions taken by the U.S. government, U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and foreign central banks;     

changes in laws and regulations and industry practices; and     

other market developments.     

 Current Market Conditions and Trends 
   
 In its September 21, 2016 statement announcing that it was maintaining a target federal funds rate range of 0.25% to 0.50%, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) acknowledged that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year.  However, while the FOMC commented that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened, it will wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation before making further changes to its targeted federal funds rate.  In its statement, the FOMC also commented that it expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  Based on federal fund futures prices, market participants currently believe that it is likely that the FOMC will raise its target federal funds rate 25 basis points by the end of this year. 
   
   Following the United Kingdom s referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (the  Brexit ), there was speculation that Brexit could adversely affect global economic and market conditions.  Global financial markets initially experienced severe volatility in response to the Brexit, creating selling pressure in riskier asset classes and increased demand for U.S. Treasuries driving the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate to a historic low during the first few weeks of July.  However, as  
 29 

concerns regarding Brexit began to subside and domestic economic and m  arket conditions appeared more favorable, investor demand for risk assets increased during the remaining part of the third quarter.  Prices on U.S. Treasury securities declined during the third quarter driving yields higher   with     t  he 10-year U.S. Treasury r  ate increas  ing   11 basis points to 1.60% as of September 30, 2016.   
   
 In a residential mortgage environment characterized by historically low interest rates, steady home price appreciation and increased lender origination capacity, mortgage refinancing volumes have remained high leading to elevated prepayments speeds in residential mortgage loans.  Near term market expectations are that prepayment speeds in residential MBS will remain elevated before returning to normalized levels with the continued concerns regarding prepayment levels leading to pay-up premiums for specified agency MBS remaining relatively unchanged during the third quarter.   The above factors contributed to residential MBS option-adjusted spreads narrowing during the third quarter. 
   
   On October 14, 2016, new rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission governing money market funds went into effect.  Under the new rules, prime institutional money market funds are now required to mark their daily net asset value and impose temporary redemption gates and fees during volatile periods.  In anticipation of the new rules going effective, many investors began moving toward money market funds that invest only in government securities and away from prime money market funds prior to the effective date of the new rules.  As a result of this diminished demand for prime money market funds during the third quarter, issuers of commercial paper and certificates of deposit that supply prime money market funds have experienced higher funding costs as yields moved higher and funding risk premium widened, while demand increased for high quality short-term assets such as repurchase agreement financing secured by agency MBS.  As a result, many funding benchmark rates, such as LIBOR, have risen significantly while financing rates on repurchase agreement financing secured by agency MBS became more competitive.  In general, this led to improved net funding costs of short-term repurchase agreement financing hedged with interest rate swaps as the three-month LIBOR received on interest rate swaps has increased more than the financing rates paid on repurchase agreement financing during the third quarter of 2016.  
   
 Housing prices continue to rise on stronger fundamentals and investor-fueled demand, as well as lack of adequate supply.  The S P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA index reported a 5.1% annual gain in July 2016 and is within 0.6% of its record high set in July 2006.  Market expectations are for housing prices to continue to gradually improve from their post-financial crisis lows. 
   
 Recent Government Activity 
   
 We expect debate and discussion on residential housing and mortgage reform to continue over the next few years; however, we cannot be certain if or when any existing housing finance reform bill will emerge from committee or be approved by Congress, and if so, what the effects may be. Historically, significant legislation has been difficult to pass in a presidential election year, and we cannot predict what effect the 2016 elections will have on the progress of housing finance reform legislation.  

Executive Summary 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s book value was $18.83 per share, an increase of 0.3% from $18.77 per share as of June 30, 2016. The Company s tangible book value, which is calculated as shareholders  equity less the Company s net deferred tax asset, was $14.63 per share as of September 30, 2016, an increase of 5.1% from $13.92 per share as of June 30, 2016. The increase in tangible book value per share during the quarter is attributable primarily to an increase in value of the Company s hedged agency MBS portfolio driven by a rise in interest rates and a narrowing of agency MBS investment spreads resulting in an outperformance of the Company s interest rate hedges relative to its agency MBS investment portfolio.   
 For the third quarter of 2016, the Company had net income of $0.81 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.56 per diluted share in the prior quarter. The Company had non-GAAP core operating income of $0.64 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.67 per diluted share in the prior quarter. For further information on the use of non-GAAP core operating income, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Non-GAAP Core Operating Income.  The decline in non-GAAP core operating income was driven largely by elevated prepayment speeds in the Company s agency MBS portfolio. 
 Since the Company s fixed-rate agency MBS have generally been purchased at a premium to par value, high prepayments can have a negative impact on the Company s asset yields and interest income, while slow prepayments can have a positive impact. The actual constant prepayment rate ( CPR ) for the Company s agency MBS increased to 12.64% for the third quarter of 2016 from 11.40% in the prior quarter, resulting in a decline in the average asset yield to 2.60% during the third quarter compared to 2.73% in the prior quarter.  
 30 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company s earnings benefited from an improvement in the spread between the three  -month LIBOR that the Company receives on its interest rate swap agreements and the funding rates that it pays on its repurchase agreement financing that are generally based on one-month LIBOR.  The average rate the Company receives on its interest rate sw  ap agreements increased more than the average financing rate the Company pays on its repurchase agreement financing during the third quarter.    
 The value of the Company s hedged agency MBS portfolio performed well during the third quarter benefiting from the rise in interest rates and narrowing of agency MBS investment spreads.  During the third quarter of 2016, the net value of the Company s hedged agency MBS portfolio increased by $0.76 per share, or 5.5% of the Company s prior quarter tangible book value per share.   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s agency investment portfolio totaled $4,839 million, comprised of $3,669 million of specified agency MBS and $1,170 million of net long  to-be-announced  ( TBA ) agency MBS.  During the third quarter, the Company increased its agency investment allocation to TBA agency MBS to take advantage of higher risk adjusted returns in the TBA dollar roll market as compared to owning specified agency MBS financed with repurchase agreement financing.  The Company generated TBA dollar roll income of $5.3 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $3.7 million in the prior quarter.  
 The Company continues to maintain a substantial hedge position with the intent to protect the Company s capital and earnings potential against increased interest rates over the long-term. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s interest rate hedge position consisted solely of interest rate swaps coupled with put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures.  During the third quarter, the Company modified the composition of its hedge position in options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures by effectively moving the option strike prices closer to the money with the goal of improving the responsiveness of the position to rising interest rates, while still maintaining flexibility in a declining rate environment and reducing the overall cost of the structure. 
 We believe our hedging strategy will continue to enable the Company to maintain an attractive return on its agency MBS portfolio in order to produce resilient and predictable non-GAAP core operating income that supports consistent dividends to our shareholders. In a falling interest rate and wider spread environment, this hedging strategy will likely result in a temporary decline in book value.  However, the Company would expect temporary declines in book value to be recovered over time either through higher future spread earnings if interest rates remain low and spreads wide, or through a reversal of temporary decline in book value if future interest rates rise and spreads narrow. During the third quarter, the Company experienced a recovery of book value as interest rates rose and spreads narrowed.  The consistent execution of our hedging strategy may also result in an increase in leverage during periods of temporary declines in book value or decreases in leverage during periods of temporary increases in book value.    
 The Company constantly monitors its allocation of its available capital between agency MBS and private-label MBS in an effort to maximize returns to its shareholders. The Company continued to opportunistically sell private-label MBS and reinvest the net proceeds into agency MBS in what it believes will deliver higher risk adjusted returns. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company sold private-label MBS for gross proceeds of $67.8 million and redeployed the available capital into agency MBS.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company s available capital was allocated approximately 96% to agency MBS and 4% to private-label MBS, compared to 86% to agency MBS and 14% to private-label MBS as of June 30, 2016. 

Portfolio Overview 
 The following table summarizes our MBS investment portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

31 

(1)    
 
 Net long agency TBA positions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of  derivative assets, at fair value  and  derivative liabilities, at fair value,  with a collective net asset carrying value of $6,266 and a net liability carrying value of $553 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    

 Our specified agency MBS consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

The actual CPR for the Company s agency MBS was 12.64% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s agency MBS was comprised of securities specifically selected for their relatively lower propensity for prepayment, which includes approximately 85% in specified pools of low balance loans while the remainder includes specified pools of loans originated in certain geographical areas, loans refinanced through the U.S. Government sponsored Home Affordable Refinance Program ( HARP ), loans with low FICO scores or with other characteristics selected for their relatively lower propensity for prepayment. 
   
 Our agency MBS investment portfolio also includes net long TBA positions, which are primarily the result of executing sequential series of  dollar roll  transactions that are settled on a net basis. In accordance with GAAP, we account for our net long TBA positions as derivative instruments.  Information about the Company s net long TBA positions as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(1)    
 
  Notional amount  represents the unpaid principal balance of the underlying agency MBS.    

(2)    
 
  Implied cost basis  represents the contractual forward price for the underlying agency MBS.    

(3)    
 
  Implied fair value  represents the current fair value of the underlying agency MBS.    

(4)    
 
  Net carrying amount  represents the difference between the implied cost basis and the current fair value of the underlying MBS. This amount is reflected on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as a component of  derivative assets, at fair value  and  derivative liabilities, at fair value.     

 Our private-label MBS, excluding our interest-only MBS, consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

As of September 30, 2016, the private-label MBS portfolio consists primarily of  re-REMIC  securities. The Company s investments in re-REMIC securities represent  mezzanine  interests in underlying, re-securitized senior class MBS issued by private-label Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit ( REMIC ) securitization trusts. The senior class REMIC securities that serve as  
 32 

collateral to the Company s investments in re-REMIC securities represent beneficial   interests in pools of prime or Alt-A residential mortgage loan collateral that hold the first right to cash flows and absorb credit losses only after their respective subordinate REMIC classes have been fully extinguished. The majority of the trusts that   issued the Company s investments in re-REMIC securities employ a  sequential  principal repayment structure, while a minority of the issuing trusts employ a  pro-rata  principal repayment structure. Accordingly, the majority of the Company s mezzanine clas  s re-REMIC securities are not entitled to receive principal repayments until the principal balance of the senior interest in the respective collateral group has been reduced to zero. Principal shortfalls are allocated on a  reverse sequential  basis. Accor  dingly, any principal shortfalls on the underlying senior class REMIC securities are first absorbed by the Company s mezzanine class re-REMIC securities, to the extent of their respective principal balance, prior to being allocated to the senior interest i  n the respective collateral pool. Periodic interest accrues on each re-REMIC security s outstanding principal balance at its contractual coupon rate.   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $6.0 million of outstanding repurchase agreement financing secured by $13.4 million of private-label MBS with a weighted-average cost of funding of 2.38%. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds of $67.8 million and $106.1 million, respectively, from the sales of our private-label MBS, realizing $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in net gains. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased private-label MBS for $5.4 million with a face amount of $5.2 million. 
 The Company attempts to hedge a portion of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with its agency MBS primarily through the use of interest rate derivatives. Specifically, these interest rate derivatives are intended to economically hedge changes, attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates, in agency MBS fair values and future interest cash flows on the Company s short-term financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate derivative instruments used by the Company were centrally cleared interest rate swap agreements and exchange-traded put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures. 
 The Company s interest rate swap agreements represent agreements to make semiannual interest payments based upon a fixed interest rate and receive quarterly variable interest payments based upon the prevailing three-month LIBOR on the date of reset. Information about the Company s outstanding centrally cleared interest rate swap agreements in effect as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

During the third quarter, the Company also entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements which have effective dates in late September 2017 and early October 2017 and mature two years from their respective effective dates. The effective dates of these forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were set to occur within reasonable proximity to the maturity dates of certain of the Company s existing interest rate swap agreements, economically extending the life of the maturing instruments. Information about the Company s forward-starting interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

In addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company had also purchased and sold exchange-traded options on U.S. Treasury note futures contracts as of September 30, 2016 with the objective of hedging a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of the Company s agency MBS portfolio.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company holds put options which provide the Company with the right to sell 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures to a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $600 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 1.71%.  In addition, the Company has sold, or written, call options that provide a counterparty with the option to buy 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from the Company with an equivalent notional amount of $600 million that were struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of approximately 1.39%.  In order to limit its exposure on the sold call options from a significant decline in long-term interest rates, the Company also purchased contracts that provide the Company with the option to buy 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures from a counterparty with an equivalent notional amount of $300 million as of September 30, 2016 that were  
 33 

struck at a weighted average strike price per contract that equates to a 10-year U.S. Tre  asury rate of approximately 1.07  %.  The options may be exercised at any time prior to their expiry, which occurs in the fourth quarter of 2016, and, if exercised, will be net settled in cash.      Information about the Company s outstanding put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note   futures contracts as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows   (dollars in thousands):

 The implied strike rate is estimated based upon the weighted average strike price per option contract and the price of an equivalent 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures contract.    

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP primarily represents the interest income recognized from our investments in specified agency MBS and private-label MBS (including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts), net of the interest expense incurred from repurchase agreement financing arrangements or other short- and long-term borrowing transactions. In the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a change in our accounting policy for recognizing interest income on our investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities by amortizing purchase premiums (or accreting purchase discounts) as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with the  interest method  permitted by GAAP. Prior to January 1, 2016, interest income from trading agency MBS was reported based upon each security s stated coupon rate. Refer to  Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies for recognizing interest income for our investments in MBS. 
 Net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP does not include TBA agency MBS dollar roll income, which represents the economic equivalent of net interest income generated from our investments in non-specified fixed-rate agency MBS, nor does it include the implied net interest income or expense of our interest rate swap agreements, which are not designated as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes. In our consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, TBA agency MBS dollar roll income and the implied net interest income or expense incurred from our interest rate swap agreements are reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of derivative instruments within the line item  gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net  of the  investment gain (loss), net  section. 
 Investment Gain (Loss), Net 
  Investment gain (loss), net  primarily consists of periodic changes in the fair value (whether realized or unrealized) of investments in MBS classified as trading securities, periodic changes in the fair value (whether realized or unrealized) of derivative instruments, gains (losses) realized upon the sale of investments in MBS classified as available-for-sale, and other-than-temporary impairment charges for investments in MBS classified as available-for-sale. 
 We evaluate available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is less than its amortized cost at the reporting date, the security is considered impaired. When evaluating whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than amortized cost, (2) the severity of the decline in fair value, (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (4) our intent to sell the security, and (5) whether it is more-likely-than-not we would be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our amortized cost basis. 
 34 

For private-label MBS, on a quarterly basis, we re-estimate the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected based upon current informati  on and events. For available-for-sale private-label MBS that are impaired, we compare the present value of our revised estimate of the amount and timing of expected cash flows, discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate used for interest   income recognition, to the security s amortized cost basis. Any shortfall between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the security s amortized cost basis is recognized as an   other-than-temporary impairment   charge in net income as   a component of  investment gain (loss), net.   
 General and Administrative Expenses 
  Compensation and benefits expense  includes base salaries, annual incentive cash compensation, and non-cash stock-based compensation. Annual cash incentive compensation is based on meeting estimated annual performance measures and discretionary components. Non-cash stock-based compensation includes expenses associated with all stock-based awards granted to employees, including the Company s performance share units to named executive officers. 
  Other general and administrative expenses  primarily consists of the following: 

professional services expenses, including accounting, legal, and consulting fees;     

insurance expenses, including liability and property insurance;     

occupancy and equipment expense, including rental costs for our facilities, and depreciation and amortization of equipment and software;     

fees and commissions related to transactions in interest rate derivative instruments;     

Board of Director fees; and     

other operating expenses, including information technology expenses, business development costs, public company reporting expenses, proxy solicitation expenses, business licenses and taxes, office supplies, and other miscellaneous office expenses.     

 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 
 The following table presents the net income (loss) reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Net Interest Income 
   Net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP ( GAAP net interest income ) decreased $7.8 million, or 29.9%, from $26.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $16.6 million, or 21.7%, from $76.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $60.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in each comparative period is primarily attributable to (i) a meaningful increase in the proportion of our agency MBS portfolio represented by net long positions in non-specified TBA securities (which are accounted for as derivative instruments) with a corresponding reduction in the proportion represented by specified agency MBS, (ii) lower asset yields on the Company s agency MBS driven by higher relative prepayments in the current year periods, and (iii) 27 basis point increases in the average interest costs of our short-term financing arrangements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016,  
 35 

relative to the comparative periods from the prior year   due primarily to an increase in prevailing benchmark   short-term   interest rates.   As previously no  ted, TBA dollar roll income is not included in net interest income dete  rmined in accordance with GAAP.  
 The components of GAAP net interest income from our MBS investments portfolio, excluding interest expense on unsecured long-term debt, are summarized in the following tables (dollars in thousands): 

The effects of changes in the composition of our investments on our GAAP net interest income from our MBS investment activities are summarized below (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   
 
 The change in interest income and interest expense due to both rate and volume has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.    

 36 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the percentage allocation of our total agency MBS portfolio to net long positions in non-specified TBA securities and specified agency MBS was   19  % and   81  %, respectively, as compared to   6  % and   94  %, respectively, for the   three months ended September 30, 20  15  .      D  uring the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the percentage allocation of our total agency MBS portfolio to net long positions in non-specified TBA securities and specified agency MBS was 16% and 84%, respectively, as compared to 5  % and   95  %, respe  ctively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as illustrated by the following table (dollars in thousands):  

(1)   
 
 Net long TBA position average balance (average cost basis) is based upon the contractual price of the initial TBA purchase trade of each individual series of dollar roll transactions.    

 As a result of the substantial increase in our TBA portfolio, TBA dollar roll income increased $3.4 million to $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million for the comparative period of 2015, and increased $8.4 million to $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.4 million for the comparative period of 2015. When adjusting our net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP to include TBA dollar roll income (which is net of implied financing costs), the total spread income earned from our aggregate MBS investment portfolio for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $4.4 million (or 15.0%) and $7.6 million (or 9.0%), respectively, relative to the comparative periods from the prior year.  The reduction in total spread income in the current year periods relative to the prior year periods is due primarily to (i) a reduction in asset revenues driven by relatively higher prepayments on our specified agency MBS resulting a lower weighted average yield on those assets as well as (ii) an increase in the costs of our short-term financing arrangements and the implied financing costs of our TBA dollar rolls driven primarily by an increase in prevailing short-term interest rates. The following tables provide a comparison of GAAP interest income, GAAP net interest income (excluding interest expense from long-term debt), and TBA dollar roll income for periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 

(1)    
 
 TBA dollar roll income is net of implied financing costs.    

 Interest expense related to long-term debt was $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Interest expense related to long-term debt was $3.6 million and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense on long-term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the comparative period from the prior year is primarily attributable to the issuance in March 2015 of $35.3 million of Senior Notes due 2025. 
 37 

Investment   Gain (  Loss  )  , Net  
   Total investment gain (loss), net  increased $80.5 million from a loss of $59.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a gain of $20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the third quarter of 2016, we recognized fair value gains on our agency MBS portfolio driven by a meaningful narrowing of agency MBS spreads while we also recognized fair value gains on our interest rate derivative instruments (intended to economically hedge our interest rate risk) driven by an increase in prevailing interest rates, resulting in the outperformance of interest rate derivative instruments relative to our agency MBS portfolio.  In the third quarter of 2015, a reduction in prevailing longer-term interest rates drove the recognition of fair value gains on our agency MBS portfolio and the recognition of fair value losses on our interest rate derivative instruments. The widening of agency MBS spreads during the third quarter of 2015 resulted in the underperformance of our agency MBS portfolio relative to our interest rate derivative instruments, resulting in a net investment loss on our hedged agency MBS portfolio.   Total investment loss, net  decreased $82.0 million from a loss of $120.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a loss of $38.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Within each of these comparative periods, declines in prevailing longer-term interest rates drove the recognition of fair value losses on our interest rate derivative instruments that were not fully offset by fair value gains recognized on our agency MBS investments. 
 Further detail about the gains and losses recognized due to the changes in the fair value of our agency MBS, TBA transactions, and interest rate derivative instruments for the periods indicated is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Available-for-sale investments substantially consist of our private-label MBS acquired prior to 2015. The realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments, net, recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were the result of $67.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively, of proceeds received from the sales of private-label MBS resulting in net realized gains of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments, net, recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were the result of $96.2 million and $124.6 million, respectively, of proceeds received from the sales of private-label MBS resulting in realized gains of $1.8 million and $17.4 million, respectively. 
 We recorded credit related other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 on available-for-sale, private-label MBS. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Credit related other-than-temporary impairment charges represent the excess of the amortized cost basis over the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security s existing effective interest rate used for interest income recognition. 
 Investments classified as trading securities primarily consist of agency MBS. The $2.5 million of net gains recognized for the third quarter of 2016 were primarily driven by meaningful agency MBS spread narrowing which more than offset the effect of the increase in longer-term interest rates that occurred during the period.  The $81.1 million of net gains recognized for the nine months ended 2016 were primarily driven by the decrease in prevailing longer-term interest rates during the period combined with agency MBS spread narrowing. The $36.9 million and $5.2 million of net gains on trading investments recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were primarily the result of a decrease in prevailing longer-term interest rates.  
 Commitments to purchase and sell MBS consist primarily of forward-settling purchases of TBA agency MBS that are generally settled on a net basis through the execution of dollar roll transactions and, to a lesser extent, certain commitments to purchase specified agency MBS that will be settled by the physical delivery of the securities. We recognized net gains of $6.8 million and $30.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and net gains of $6.4 million and $3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, from forward-settling commitments to purchase and sell agency MBS, which consists of both TBA dollar roll income as well as other fair value gains and losses stemming from these forward-settling commitments. 
 38 

Our interest rate derivative instruments   currently   consist   of centrally-cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded   put   and ca  ll   options on U.S. Treasury note futures, and have historically also included   U.S. Treasury note futures,   Eurodollar futures,   and   interest rate swap futures. While we use interest rate derivatives to economically hedge a portion of our interest rate risk,   we have not designated such contracts as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes. As a result, the implied economic financing costs of our interest rate derivatives are included in the change in fair value of the instruments recognized in  inv  estment   gain (  loss  )  , net  rather than in net interest income. During periods of falling interest rates, we will generally experience losses on our interest rate derivative instruments and during periods of rising interest rates, we will generally experienc  e gains on our interest rate derivative instruments.     The $  8.4   million     of net gains   recognized for   interest rate   derivative instruments for the   third quarter of 2016   wer  e primarily attributable to   the   increase   in   prevailing   longer-term interest rates that o  ccurred during the period  , partially offset by   the implied net economic financing costs of   our   interest rate   swap agreements  .   The $104.0 million of net losses recognized for interest rate derivative instruments during the third quarter of 2015 as well as t  he $150.5 million and $146.4 million of net losses recognized for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively,   were primarily driven by   a     de  crease in   prevailing   long  er  -term interest rates during   each respective   period,   coupled wi  th   the implied net economic financing costs of certain of the interest rate derivatives.  
 The fair value of our hedging instruments is expected to fluctuate inversely relative to the change in fair value of the agency MBS portfolio. However, the degree of correlation between the price movements of our hedging instruments and those of our agency MBS portfolio may vary. While our hedging instruments are designed to protect our agency MBS portfolio from interest rate risk, they are not generally designed to protect our net book value from spread risk, which is the risk of an increase of the market spread between the yield on our agency MBS and the benchmark yield on U.S. Treasury securities or interest rate swaps. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 31.4%, from $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased by $5.8 million, or 53.7%, from $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $16.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Compensation and benefits expensed increased by $1.3 million, or 61.9%, from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased by $1.6 million, or 22.2%, from $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in compensation and benefits expense is attributable primarily to an increase in long-term performance oriented stock-based compensation. Employee stock-based compensation increased by $1.2 million from $(0.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased by $1.9 million from $(0.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not achieve certain performance measures for certain of the Company s performance share units granted to executive officers, which resulted in the reversal of stock-based compensation expense that had been recognized in prior periods.   
  Other general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 14.3%, from $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Other general and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 113.5%, from $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to non-recurring proxy contest related expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $4.0 million in expenses stemming from the 2016 proxy contest that are in excess of the level of expenses normally incurred for an annual meeting of shareholders. In March 2016, Imation Corp., an IT data storage and data security company, acting in concert with the Clinton Group, Inc. (together,  Imation Group ) nominated a controlling slate of five candidates to stand for election to our eight-member board of directors at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. As of the record date for the 2016 meeting, the Imation Group owned collectively 11,000 shares of our Class A common stock, representing less than 0.05% of our outstanding common stock. At our annual shareholder meeting on June 9, 2016, our shareholders overwhelmingly voted to elect all of our eight director nominees. In connection with the proxy contest, we incurred non-recurring legal fees, financial advisory fees, proxy solicitor fees, mailing and printing costs of proxy solicitation materials, and other costs in excess of the level of expenses normally incurred for an annual meeting of shareholders. 
 Income Tax Provision 
   We recognized an income tax provision of $15.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and an income tax provision of $5.1 million and $33.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is net of an increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of $2.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively, and the income tax provision recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is net of increases in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of $3.6 million and $59.2 million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for three and nine months ended  
 39 

September 30, 2015 is due mostly to net capital losses generated during the periods p  rimarily as a result of realized and unrealized losses on certain of our economic interest rate hedging instruments.   The valuation allowance represents the portion of our net capital loss carryforward that is more-likely-than-not to expire unutilized.  
 Other Comprehensive Loss 
 Other comprehensive income (loss) represents periodic unrealized holding gains and losses related to our investments in MBS classified as available-for-sale. Accumulated unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale MBS are reclassified into net income as a component of  investment gain (loss), net  upon (i) sale and realization, or (ii) the occurrence of an other-than-temporary impairment. Other comprehensive loss was $2.5 million and $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, other comprehensive income included net unrealized holding losses of $0.4 million on the available-for-sale MBS portfolio, net of a tax benefit of $0.1 million, and $3.0 million of reversal of prior period net unrealized gains upon the sale of available-for-sale MBS, net of a tax benefit of $0.6 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, other comprehensive loss included net unrealized holding losses of $4.0 million on the available-for-sale MBS portfolio, net of a tax benefit of $1.6 million, and $1.4 million of reversal of prior period net unrealized gains upon the sale of available-for-sale MBS, net of a tax benefit of $0.3 million. 
 Other comprehensive loss was $7.7 million and $24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other comprehensive loss included net unrealized holding losses of $10.1 million on the available-for-sale MBS portfolio, net of a tax benefit of $3.9 million, $3.3 million of reversal of prior period net unrealized gains upon the sale of available-for-sale MBS, net of a tax benefit of $0.8 million, and $1.7 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale securities, net of a tax provision of $0.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, other comprehensive loss included net unrealized holding losses of $10.9 million on the available-for-sale MBS portfolio, net of a tax benefit of $4.1 million and $22.7 million of reversal of prior period net unrealized gains upon the sale of available-for-sale MBS, net of a tax benefit of $5.0 million. 

Non-GAAP Core Operating Income 
   
 In addition to the results of operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied in the United States ( GAAP ), we reported  non-GAAP core operating income .  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we define core operating income as  economic net interest income  less  core general and administrative expenses.  
   
 Economic Net Interest Income 
   
 Economic net interest income is comprised of the following: periodic (i) net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP, (ii) TBA agency MBS  dollar roll  income, and (iii) net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements. 

Net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP  .  Net interest income determined in accordance with GAAP primarily represents the interest income recognized from our investments in specified agency MBS and private-label MBS (including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts), net of the interest expense incurred from repurchase agreement financing arrangements or other short- and long-term borrowing transactions. In the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a change in our accounting policy for recognizing interest income on our investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities by amortizing purchase premiums (or accreting purchase discounts) as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with the  interest method  permitted by GAAP.     

TBA agency MBS dollar roll income  .  Dollar roll income represents the economic equivalent of net interest income (implied interest income net of financing costs) generated from our investments in non-specified fixed-rate agency MBS, executed through sequential series of forward-settling purchase and sale transactions that are settled on a net basis (known as  dollar roll  transactions). Dollar roll income is generated as a result of delaying, or  rolling,  the settlement of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS by entering into an offsetting  spot  sale prior to the settlement date, net settling the  paired-off  positions in cash, and contemporaneously entering another forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS of the same essential characteristics for a later settlement date at a price discount relative to the  spot  sale. The price discount of the forward-settling purchase relative to the contemporaneously executed  spot  sale represents the economic equivalent of net interest income that is earned ratably over the period beginning on the settlement date of the sale and ending on the settlement date of the forward-settling purchase. In our consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, TBA agency MBS dollar roll income is reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of      

 40 

TBA forward commitments within the li  ne item  gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net  of the  investment gain (loss), net  section.     

Net interest income earned or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements  . We utilize centrally-cleared interest rate swap agreements to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to variability in future interest cash flows, attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates, associated with future roll-overs of our short-term financing arrangements. Accordingly, the net interest income earned or expense incurred (commonly referred to as  net interest carry ) from our interest rate swap agreements in combination with interest expense recognized in accordance with GAAP represents our effective  economic interest expense.  In our consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, the net interest income earned or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements is reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of derivative instruments within the line item  gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net  of the  investment gain (loss), net  section.     

Core General and Administrative Expenses 
   
 Core general and administrative expenses are non-interest expenses reported within the line item  total other expenses  of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income less stock-based compensation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, core general and administrative expenses also exclude non-recurring expenses related to the 2016 proxy contest that are in excess of those normally incurred for an annual meeting of shareholders.  
   
 Non-GAAP Core Operating Income for 2016 
   
 The following table presents our computation of non-GAAP core operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP pre-tax net income to non-GAAP core operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (amounts in thousands): 

Non-GAAP core operating income is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company s long-term-focused, net interest spread-based investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist with the determination of the appropriate level of periodic dividends to stockholders. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company s long-term-focused, net interest spread-based investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity. 
 41 

Other than MBS interest income, TBA dollar roll income, and interest rate swap net interest income or expense, periodic fair value gains and losses recognized with respect to our investments in MBS and our economic hedging instruments, which are reported in line item  total investment gain (loss), net  of our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, are excluded from the computation of non-GAAP core operating income as such gains on losses are not reflective of the economic interest income earned or interest expense incurred from our interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities during the indicated reporting period.  Because our long-term-focused investment strategy for our agency MBS investment portfolio is to generate a net interest spread on the leveraged assets while prudently hedging periodic changes in the fair value of those assets attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates, we generally expect the fluctuations in the fair value of our agency MBS investments and our economic hedging instruments to largely offset one another over time. 
   
 A limitation of utilizing this non-GAAP financial measure is that the effect of accounting for  non-core  events or transactions in accordance with GAAP does, in fact, reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results. For example, the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements, such as U.S. Treasury note futures or options on U.S. Treasury note futures, do not affect the computation of non-GAAP core operating income. Therefore, we believe that non-GAAP core operating income should be considered as a supplement to, and in conjunction with, net income and comprehensive income determined in accordance with GAAP. 
   
 Non-GAAP Core Operating Income for Fiscal Year 2015 
   
 We retrospectively applied our revised definition of core operating income to the quarterly and annual periods of fiscal year 2015. We note, however, that the non-GAAP core operating income measures computed for prior year periods are not directly comparable to the results computed for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as we solely utilized hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements prior to November 2015. The economic costs or benefits of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements do not affect the computation of non-GAAP core operating income. 
   
 The results of the retrospective application of our revised definition of non-GAAP core operating income to fiscal year 2015 are presented in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP pre-tax net income to non-GAAP core operating income for fiscal year 2015 (amounts in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund investments, meet margin calls on our short-term borrowings and hedging instruments, and for other general business purposes. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of existing cash balances, short-term borrowings (for example, repurchase agreements), principal and interest payments from our investments in MBS, and proceeds from sales of MBS. Other sources of liquidity include proceeds from the offering of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or other securities registered pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
 Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. Perceived liquidity issues may affect our counterparties  willingness to engage in transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects us or third parties. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. If we cannot obtain funding from third parties or from our subsidiaries, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 As of September 30, 2016, our debt-to-equity leverage ratio was 7.9 to 1. As of September 30, 2016, our  at risk  leverage ratio was 10.2 to 1.  Our  at risk  leverage is measured as the ratio of the sum of our total debt (excluding any unamortized issuance costs) and net payable for unsettled securities compared to our tangible stockholders  equity. Tangible stockholders  equity is measured as our stockholders  equity less our net deferred tax asset. 
 Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.8 million, representing a net increase of $5.8 million from $37.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities of $64.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable primarily to net interest income less our general and administrative expenses. Cash provided by investing activities of $229.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily generated by sales of MBS and the receipt of principal payments from agency MBS, partially offset by purchases of new agency MBS and funding of settlements and deposits for margin calls on our interest rate derivative instruments. Cash used in financing activities of $288.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relates primarily to net repayments of FHLBC advances and dividend payments to common stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds obtained from repurchase agreements used to finance a portion of our MBS investment portfolio. 
 Sources of Funding 
 We believe that our existing cash balances, net investments in MBS, cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity, and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may, however, seek debt or equity financings, in public or private transactions, to provide capital for corporate purposes and/or strategic business opportunities, including possible acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays. Our policy is to evaluate strategic business opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures, as they arise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from future operations, or raise sufficient debt or equity on acceptable terms, to take advantage of investment opportunities that become available. Should our needs ever exceed these sources of liquidity, we believe that most of our investments could be sold, in most circumstances, to provide cash. However, we may be required to sell our assets in such instances at depressed prices. 
 As of September 30, 2016, liquid assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million and net investments in MBS of $316.4 million. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in debt obligations of the U.S. government. The Company s net investments in MBS is calculated as the sum of the Company s total MBS investments at fair value and receivable for sold MBS, less the sum of the repurchase agreements outstanding and payable for purchased MBS.  
 Long-Term Debt 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $73.6 million of total long-term unsecured debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.7 million. Our trust preferred debt obligations with an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2016 accrue and require the payment of interest quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 2.25% to 3.00% and mature between 2033 and 2035. Our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 with a principal amount of $25.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2016 accrue and require payment of interest quarterly at an annual rate of 6.625% and mature on May 1, 2023. Our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2025 with a principal amount of $35.3 million outstanding as of September 30, 2016 accrue and require payment of interest quarterly at an annual rate of 6.75% and mature on March 15, 2025. 
 43 

Repurchase Agreements  
 We have short-term financing facilities that are structured as repurchase agreements with various financial institutions to fund our investments in MBS. We have obtained, and believe we will be able to continue to obtain, short-term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives. Funding for MBS through repurchase agreements continues to be available to us at rates we consider to be attractive from multiple counterparties. 
 Our repurchase agreements include provisions contained in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and may be amended and supplemented in accordance with industry standards for repurchase facilities. Our repurchase agreements include financial covenants, with which the failure to comply would constitute an event of default under the applicable repurchase agreement. Similarly, each repurchase agreement includes events of insolvency and events of default on other indebtedness as similar financial covenants. As provided in the standard master repurchase agreement as typically amended, upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination, the applicable counterparty has the option to terminate all repurchase transactions under such counterparty s repurchase agreement and to demand immediate payment of any amount due from us to the counterparty. 
 Under our repurchase agreements, we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral (commonly referred to as a  margin call ), which may take the form of additional securities or cash. Margin calls on repurchase agreements collateralized by our MBS investments primarily result from events such as declines in the value of the underlying mortgage collateral caused by factors such as rising interest rates or prepayments. Our repurchase agreements generally provide that valuations for MBS securing our repurchase agreements are to be obtained from a generally recognized source agreed to by both parties.  However, in certain circumstances and under certain of our repurchase agreements, our lenders have the sole discretion to determine the value of the MBS securing our repurchase agreements. In such instances, our lenders are required to act in good faith in making determinations of value. Our repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call, we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that the margin call is made if the lender provides us notice prior to the margin notice deadline on such day. 
 To date, we have not had any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral. However, should we encounter increases in interest rates or prepayments, margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result in a material adverse change in our liquidity position. 
 Our repurchase agreements generally mature within 30 to 90 days, but may have maturities as short as one day and as long as one year. In the event that market conditions are such that we are unable to continue to obtain repurchase agreement financing for our investments in MBS in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives, we may liquidate such investments and may incur significant losses on any such sales of MBS. 
 In the event that market conditions are such that we are unable to obtain financing for our investments in MBS in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives, to the extent deemed appropriate, we may use cash to finance our investments or we may liquidate such investments. Accordingly, depending upon market conditions, we may incur significant losses on any such sales of MBS.

The following table provides information regarding our outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings as of dates and periods indicated (dollars in thousands):  

(1)    
 
 Net amount represents the value of collateral in excess of corresponding repurchase obligation. The amount of collateral at-risk is limited to the outstanding repurchase obligation and not the entire collateral balance.    

 To limit our exposure to counterparty risk, we diversify our repurchase agreement funding across multiple counterparties and by counterparty region. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding repurchase agreement balances with 16 counterparties. We currently have master repurchase agreements in place with a total of 18 counterparties located throughout North America, Europe and Asia. As of September 30, 2016, less than 5% of our stockholders  equity was at risk with any one counterparty, with the top five counterparties representing approximately 20% of our stockholders  equity. The table below includes a summary of our repurchase agreement funding by number of counterparties and counterparty region as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

Derivative Instruments  
 In the normal course of our operations, we are a party to financial instruments that are accounted for as derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures, U.S. Treasury note futures, put and call options, and certain forward-settling MBS purchase and sale commitments. 
 We exchange collateral with the counterparties to our interest rate derivative instruments at least on a daily basis based upon daily changes in fair value (also known as  variation margin ) as measured by the central clearinghouse through which those derivatives are cleared. In addition, the central clearinghouse requires market participants to deposit and maintain an  initial margin  amount which is determined by the clearinghouse and is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the clearinghouse from the maximum estimated single-day price movement in that market participant s contracts. The clearing exchanges have the sole discretion to determine the value of derivative instruments.  In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day. To date, we have not had any margin calls on our derivative agreements that we were not able to satisfy. However, if we encounter significant decreases in long-term interest rates, margin calls on our derivative agreements could result in a material adverse change in our liquidity position 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange traded options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures with the following aggregate notional amount, net fair value and corresponding margin held in collateral deposit with the custodian (in thousands): 

Share Repurchase Program 
 In October 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 2.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2016, 1.95 million shares of Class A common stock remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program.   
 Dividends 
 Pursuant to our variable dividend policy, our Board of Directors evaluates dividends on a quarterly basis and, in its sole discretion, approves the payment of dividends. Our dividend payments, if any, may vary significantly quarter to quarter. The Board of Directors has approved and the Company has declared and paid the following dividends to date in 2016: 

The Board of Directors approved and the Company declared and paid the following dividends for 2015: 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk (including prepayment risk and extension risk), credit risk, spread risk, liquidity risk, and regulatory risk. See  Item 1   Business  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of our risk management strategies. 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our financial position and performance far more than inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion pursuant to our variable dividend policy; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to fair value without considering inflation. 
 Credit Risk 
 Although we do not expect to encounter credit risk in our agency MBS portfolio assuming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain solvent, we are exposed to credit risk in our private-label MBS portfolio. With respect to our private-label MBS, credit support contained in these MBS deal structures provides a level of protection from losses, as do our discounted purchase prices in the event of the return of less than 100% of par. We evaluate the impact of credit risk on our investments through a comprehensive investment review and selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk. We review our private-label MBS based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments. Through modeling and scenario analysis, we seek to evaluate each investment s credit risk. Subsequent to the acquisition of a private-label MBS, we continue to monitor and evaluate its credit risk through ongoing asset surveillance and analysis. Despite the measures that we take to manage our exposure to credit risk, unanticipated credit losses could nonetheless occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Our private-label MBS are generally purchased at a discount to par value. Prior to acquisition and on an on-going basis subsequent to acquisition, we estimate the amount and timing of the cash flows expected to be collected from each private-label MBS. In preparing our future cash flow estimates, we develop a number of assumptions about the future performance of the pool of mortgage loans that serve as collateral for our investment, including assumptions about the timing and amount of prepayments and credit losses. In developing these estimates, we consider economic conditions and security-level characteristics including, but not limited to, the following: 

the cash flow structure of the issuing securitization vehicle;     

the current composition and credit characteristics of the security s pool of mortgage loan collateral;     

current levels of credit enhancements (including structural credit enhancements), including, for resecuritization certificates, the level and type of credit enhancements (for example, subordination) that exist in the underlying structured securitization vehicle;     

prevailing interest rates;     

realized home price appreciation;     

recent historical collateral performance, including voluntary prepayment, default, and loss severity rates;     

forecasts of economic factors, such as interest rates and future home price appreciation; and     

to the extent available, assumptions published by third parties about future voluntary prepayment, default, and loss severity rates for similar private-label MBS collateral pools.     

 Developing estimates of the amount and timing of the future cash flows from our investments in private-label MBS requires us to exercise significant subjective judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from our estimates, which could have a significant and potentially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 47 

The following table presents certain characteristics of our investments in private-label MBS as well as the residential mortgage loans that ultimately serve as their collateral as of and for the three mo  nths ended   September 30, 2016  :

 Calculated as the three-month default rate multiplied by the three-month loss severity rate.    

 The table that follows illustrates the estimated change in fair value of our current private-label MBS under several hypothetical credit loss scenarios. Our private-label MBS are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as private-label MBS trade infrequently and, therefore, the measurement of their fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. In determining fair value, we primarily use present value techniques based on the estimated cash flows of the instrument taking into consideration various assumptions that are based on our observations of assumptions used by market participants. The primary credit-related assumptions that are incorporated into the fair value measurement are the default rate, which represents the annual rate of expected defaulted loan liquidation events (such as foreclosure sales or short sales), and loss severity rates (or  loss-given-default ). The table below illustrates the effect that a 10% increase and decrease, respectively, in the default rate and loss severity rate assumptions from those used in our fair value measurements as of September 30, 2016 would have on total assets and stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016. Each 10% increase (decrease) in the default rate and loss severity rate assumptions was implemented in isolation (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk in our MBS portfolio. Our investments in MBS are financed with short-term borrowing facilities such as repurchase agreements, which are interest rate sensitive financial instruments. Our exposure to interest rate risk fluctuates based upon changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayments, and in the shape and slope of the yield curve, among other factors. Through the use of interest rate derivative instruments, we attempt to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to changes, attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates, in certain MBS fair values and future interest cash flows on our short-term financing arrangements. Our primary interest rate derivatives include centrally cleared interest rate swaps as well as exchange-traded instruments, such as U.S. Treasury note futures, and options on U.S. Treasury note futures. Historically, we have also utilized exchange-traded Eurodollar futures and interest rate swap futures. 
 Changes in both short- and long-term interest rates affect us in several ways, including our financial position. As interest rates increase, the fair value of fixed-rate agency MBS may be expected to decline, prepayment rates may be expected to decrease and duration may be expected to extend. However, an increase in interest rates results in an increase in the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments. Conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value of fixed-rate agency MBS is generally expected to increase while the fair value of our interest rate derivatives is expected to decline. 
   The tables that follow illustrate the expected change in fair value for our current investments in agency MBS and derivative instruments under several hypothetical scenarios of interest rate movements. For the purposes of this illustration, interest rates are defined by the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Changes in fair value are measured as percentage changes from their respective fair values  
 48 

presented in the column labeled  Value.  Our estimate of the change in the fair value of agency MBS is based upon the same assumptions we use to manage   the impact of interest rates on the portfolio.   The   interest rate sensitivity of our agency MBS and TBA commitments is derived from The Yield Book, a third-party model.     Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The effective durations   are based on observed fair value changes, as well as our own estimate of the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of the investments, including assumptions regarding prepayments based, in part, on age and interest rate of the mortgages underly  ing the MBS, prior exposure to refinancing opportunities, and an overall analysis of historical prepayment patterns under a variety of historical interest rate conditions  .  
 The interest rate sensitivity analyses illustrated by the tables that follow have certain limitations, most notably the following: 

The 50 and 100 basis point upward and downward shocks to interest rates that are applied in the analyses represent parallel shocks to the forward yield curve. The analyses do not consider the sensitivity of stockholders  equity to changes in the shape or slope of the forward yield curve.     

The analyses assume that spreads remain constant and, therefore, do not reflect an estimate of the impact that changes in spreads would have on the value of our MBS investments or our LIBOR-based derivative instruments, such as our interest rate swap agreements.     

The analyses assume a static portfolio and do not reflect activities and strategic actions that management may take in the future to manage interest rate risk in response to significant changes in interest rates or other market conditions.     

The yield curve that results from applying an instantaneous parallel 100 basis point decrease in interest rates reflects an interest rate of less than 0% in certain earlier portions of the curve. The results of the analysis included in the applicable table to follow reflect the effect of these negative interest rates.     

The analyses do not reflect any estimated changes in the fair value of our investments in private-label MBS.     

The analyses do not reflect any changes in the value of our net deferred tax asset, including any changes to the assumptions that would be incorporated into the determination of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.     

 These analyses are not intended to provide a precise forecast. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., and our Chief Financial Officer, Richard E. Konzmann, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PAR  T II  
 OTHER INFORMATION 
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are from time to time involved in civil lawsuits, legal proceedings and arbitration matters relating to our business that we consider to be in the ordinary course. There can be no assurance that these matters individually or in aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in a future period. We are also subject to the risk of litigation, including litigation that may be without merit. As we intend to actively defend such litigation, significant legal expenses could be incurred. An adverse resolution of any future litigation against us could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, we operate in highly-regulated markets that currently are under intense regulatory scrutiny, and we have received, and we expect in the future that we may receive, inquiries and requests for documents and information from various federal, state and foreign regulators. In addition, one or more of our subsidiaries have received requests to repurchase loans from various parties in connection with the former securitization business conducted by a subsidiary. We believe that the continued scrutiny of MBS, structured financed and derivative market participants increases the risk of additional inquiries and requests from regulatory or enforcement agencies and other parties. We cannot provide any assurance that these inquiries and requests will not result in further investigation of or the initiation of a proceeding against us or that, if any such investigation or proceeding were to arise, it would not materially adversely affect our Company.

 CERTIFICATION 
 I, J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., certify that: 

1.   
 
 I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of Arlington Asset Investment Corp.;    

2.   
 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;    

3.   
 
 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;    

4.   
 
 The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:    

(a)   
 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

(b)   
 
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

(c)   
 
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and    

(d)   
 
 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and    

5.

(a)   
 
  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
