ULTIMATE PRODUCTS CORPORATION  
  Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements  
   
 NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) as of September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's March 31, 2016 audited financial statements as reported in Form 10K.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended March 31, 2017. 
   
 NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources.  Management's plans to obtain such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses, and (2) as a last resort, seeking out and completing a merger with an existing operating company. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 NOTE 3   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
   
 The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing and determined there are no events to disclose.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plan of Operations . 
   
  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as  anticipate ,  believe ,  plan ,  expect ,  future ,  intend , and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing and actual results may differ materially from historical results or our predictions of future results. 
   
  General  
   
 Ultimate Products Corporation (hereinafter referred to as  UPC  or the  Company ) a Nevada corporation and developmental stage company, has the business objective of developing, producing and distributing, a magnesium oxide board called  Ultimate Building Board    for use in a number of applications 
   
 The Company was incorporated on February 15, 2008, in the state of Nevada. The Company has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, Ultimate Products has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations and the Company owns no subsidiaries. The fiscal year end is March 31. The Company has not had revenues from operations since its inception and/or any interim period in the current fiscal year. 
   
  Plan of Operation  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we have  $0 of  cash available and no current assets. We have $77,084 of current liabilities creating a working capital deficit of $77,084. From the date of inception (February 15, 2008) to September 30, 2016 the Company has recorded net losses of  $98,929  which were expenses relating to the initial development of the Company, filing its Registration Statement on Form S-1, and expenses relating to maintaining Reporting Company status with the SEC. In order to survive as a going concern, the Company will require additional capital investments or borrowed funds to meet cash flow projections and carry forward our business objectives. There can be no guarantee or assurance that we can raise adequate capital from outside sources to fund the proposed business. Failure to secure additional financing would result in business failure and a complete loss of any investment made into the Company. 
   
 The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on June 30, 2008, which was deemed effective on July 7, 2008. Since this time the Company has sold  158,000  shares of common stock to the public with total proceeds raised of  $15,800  These proceeds have been utilized by the Company to fund its initial development including administrative costs associated with maintaining its status as a Reporting Company as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. The Company plans to continue to focus efforts on to continue to fund its initial development and fund the expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company status. 
   
 The Company has filed a 15 (c) 211 with FINRA and management intends to focus efforts on obtaining a quotation for its common stock on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board ( OTCBB ). Management believes having its common stock quoted on the OTCBB will provide it increased opportunity to raise additional capital for its proposed business development. However, there can be no guarantee or assurance the Company will be successful in filing a Form 211 application and obtaining a quotation. To date there is no public market for the Company s common stock. There can be no guarantee or assurance that a public market will ever exist for the common stock. Failure to create a market for the Company s common stock would result in business failure and a complete loss of any investment made into the Company. 
   
  Product Research and Development  
   
 The Company does not anticipate any costs or expenses to be incurred for product research and development within the next twelve months. 
   
  Employees  
   
 There are no employees of the Company, excluding the current President and Director, Mr. Vogelei. The Company does not anticipate hiring any additional employees within the next twelve months. 

7 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation (the  Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures ( Disclosure Controls ) as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on this Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
   
   CEO and CFO Certifications   
   
 Appearing immediately following the Signatures section of this report there are Certifications of the CEO and the CFO. The Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications). This Item of this report, which you are currently reading is the information concerning the Evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
   
   Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
   
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
   
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

8 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
   
   Changes in Internal Controls   
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the periods ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
