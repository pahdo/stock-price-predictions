(1)         Basis of Presentation 

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include footnotes and certain financial information normally presented annually under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ); therefore, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated   financial statements and   the related   notes included in   the   Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for   the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of results that can be expected for the full year. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect   all adjustments,   including those   of a normal recurring nature, necessary   to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has evaluated all material events occurring subsequent to the date of the financial statements up to the filing of this Form 10-Q. 

(2)       Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (     FASB     ) issued new accounting guidance which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new accounting guidance establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration   to be   received in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance will be effective for the Company   as of January   1, 2018. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.   The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-17,   Consolidation (Topic 810), Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  . This ASU amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. This guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . This ASU removes the prohibition against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued   ASU   2016-15  , Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . This ASU amends   Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )   230 and is intended to provide guidance and clarification in regards to the classification of eight types of receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, including debt repayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investees and cash receipts from beneficial interest in securi  ti  zation transactions. The guidance   will be   effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its   consolidated   financial statements.  

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).   This ASU     requires companies to present, in the balance sheet, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with   the presentation of   debt discounts. In addition, the amortization of debt discount  s   is required to be presented as a component of interest expense.   The Company applied the guidance retrospectively; accordingly  , the Company reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of   $5.8   million from   Other Assets   to   Long-Term Debt  ,    less current maturities   in its December 31, 2015 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassified amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of   $0.3   million and   $0.8   million, respectively, from   Other income (expense), net   to   Interest Expense   in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic-842),   which amends the existing guidance in ASC 840   Leases  . This amendment requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases. Other significant provisions of the amendment include (i) defining the  lease term  to include the non-cancellable period together with periods for which there is a significant economic incentive for the lessee to extend or not terminate the lease; (ii) defining the initial lease liability to be recorded on the balance sheet to contemplate only those variable lease payments that depend on

UNAUDITED 

an index or that are in substance  fixed  and (iii) a dual approach for determining whether lease expense is recognized on a straight-line or accelerated basis, depending on whether the lessee is expected to consume more than an insignificant portion of the leased asset s economic benefits. This   will be effective for   the Company as of January 1, 2019   and will be applied using the   modified retrospective transition method for existing leases. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this ASU will have on its   consolidated   financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Subtopic 740-10).   This ASU requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and all deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. This ASU is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. The   Company had $  26.0   million of current deferred tax assets and   $24.9   millio  n of current deferred tax liabilities as of September 30  ,   2016, which will be presented as noncur  rent upon adoption of this ASU. 

(  3  )       Earnings P  er Share   (EPS) 

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income   for a given period   by the weighted-average number of common shares   outstanding during that period, to which dilutive securities are included in the calculation of diluted EPS, using the treasury stock method.   The calculations of the basic and diluted EPS   for the three and nine months ended September 30  , 2016 and 2015 are presented below: 

With regard to diluted EPS and the impact of the Convertible Notes (as discussed in Note 5) on the diluted EPS calculation, because the Company has the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash, per   ASC   260  ,     Earnings Per Share  ,   the settlement of the principal amount has no impact on diluted EPS. ASC 260 also requires any potential conversion premium associated with the Convertible Notes  conversion option to be considered in the calculatio  n of diluted EPS when the Company's average stock price for the periods presented is higher than the initial conversion price of   $30.25  . As this was not the case during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the conversion premium also has no impact on diluted EPS for those periods. 

(  4  )       Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of B  illings 

Reported c  osts and estimated earnings in excess of billings consist of the following: 

Claims and unapproved change orders are billable upon the agreement and resolution between the contractual parties. Increases in claims and unapproved change orders typically result from costs being incurred against existing or new positions   where   recovery   is concluded to be both probable and reliably estimable  ; decreases normally result from resolutions and subsequent billings. Other unbilled costs and profits are billable in accordance with the billing terms of each of the existing contractual arrangements and, as such, the timing of contract billing cycles can cause fluctuations in the balance of unbilled costs and profits. Ultimate resolution of other unbilled costs and profits typically involves the passage of time and, often, incremental progress toward contractual requirements or milestones.

2014 Credit Facility 

On June 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement     (  the  Original Facility,  with subsequent amendments discussed herein as amended,   the    2014   Credit Facility ) with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and a syndicate of other lenders. The   2014 Credit Facility   provides for a   $300   million revolving credit facility (the    2014   Revolver ), a   $250   million term loan (the  Term Loan ) and   a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit up to the aggregate amount of   $150   million, all maturing on May 1, 2018.   Borrowings under both the   2014 Revolver   and the Term Loan bear interest based either on Bank of America s prime lending rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), each plus an applicable margin.    

During the first half of 2016, the Company entered into   two   amendments to the Original Facility (the  Amendments ): Waiver and Amendment No. 1, entered into on February 26, 2016 ( Amendment No.1 ), and Consent and Amendment No. 2, entered into on June 8, 2016 ( Amendment No. 2 ). In Amendment No. 1, the lenders waived the Company s violation of its consolidated leverage ratio covenant and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. These violations were the result of the Company s financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which included the previously reported   $23.9   million non-cash, pre-tax charge related to an adverse ruling on the Brightwater litigation matter in the third quarter of 2015 as well as   $45.6   million of pre-tax charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 for various Five Star Electric projects. In Amendment No. 2, the lenders consented to the issuance of the Convertible Notes subject to certain conditions, including the prepayment of   $125   million on the Term Loan and the paydown of   $69   million on the   2014   Revolver, and consented to a potential sale transaction of one of the Company s business units in its Building segment. 

In addition to the Amendments  provisions discussed above, the Amendments also modified other provisions and added new provisions to the Original Facility, and Amendment No. 2 superseded and modified some of the provisions of Amendment No. 1. The following reflects the more significant changes to the Original Facility and the results of the Amendments that are now reflected in the   2014   Credit Facility. Unless otherwise noted, the changes below were primarily the result of Amendment No. 1: (1) The Company may utilize LIBOR-based borrowings. (Amendment No. 1 precluded the use of LIBOR-based borrowings until the Company filed its

compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2016; however, Amendment No. 2 negated this preclusion.) (2) The Company is subject to an increased rate on borrowings, with such rate being   100   basis points higher than the highest rate under the Original Facility if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than   3.50  :1.00 but not more than   4.00  :1.00, and an additional 100 basis points higher if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 4.00:1.00. (3) The Company will be subject to increased commitment fees if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00. (4) The impact of the Brightwater litigation matter is to be excluded from the calculation of the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenants. (5) Interest payments are due on a monthly basis; however, if the Company is in compliance with its consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenants provided in the Original Facility as of December 31, 2016, the timing of interest payments will revert to the terms of the Original Facility. (6) The accordion feature of the Original Facility, which would have allowed either an increase of   $300   million in the   2014   Revolver or the establishment of one or more new term loan commitments, is no longer available. (7) The Company s maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio was increased to   4.25  :1.00 for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 after which it returns to the Original Facility s range of   3.25  :1.00 to   3.00  :1.00. (Amendment No. 1 increased the Company s maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio covenant requirements to 4.25:1.00 for the first quarter of 2016 and 4.0:1.0 for the second and third quarters of 2016. Amendment No. 2 increased the maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio covenant requirements to 4.25:1.00 for the second and third quarters of 2016.) (8) The Company is subject to additional covenants regarding its liquidity, including a cap on the cash balance in the Company s bank account and a weekly minimum liquidity requirement (based on specified available cash balances and availability under the   2014   Revolver). (9) The Company is required to achieve certain quarterly cash collection milestones, which were eased somewhat in Amendment No. 2. (10) The Company is required to make additional quarterly principal payments, which will be applied to the Term Loan balloon payment, with some of the payments based on a percentage of certain forecasted cash collections for the prior quarter. This change will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. (11) The lenders  collateral package was increased by pledging to the lenders (i) the equity interests of each direct domestic subsidiary of the Company and (ii)   65%   of the stock of each material first-tier foreign restricted subsidiary of the Company. (12) The   2014   Credit Facility will now mature on May 1, 2018, as opposed to maturity date of the Original Facility of June 5, 2019. 

As of September 30, 2016  ,   there was $  139.3   milli  on available under the   2014   Revolver and the Company had utilized the   2014   Credit Facility for letters of credit in the amount of   $0.2 million  .    The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the   2014 Credit Facility   for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

2010 Senior Notes 

In October 2010, the Company issued $300 million of 7.625% Senior Notes due November 1, 2018 (the  2010 Notes ) in a private placement offering.  Interest on the 2010 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year.  The Company may redeem the 2010 Notes at par beginning on November 1, 2016.  At the date of any redemption, any accrued and unpaid interest is also due. 

Convertib  le Notes 

On   June 15, 2016  , the Company issued   $200   million of   2.875%   Convertible Senior Notes due   June 15, 2021     (the  Convertible Notes )   in a private placement offering. 

To account for the Convertible Notes, the Company applied the provisions of ASC 470-20,   Debt with Conversion and Other Options  . ASC 470-20 requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This is done by allocating the proceeds from issuance to the liability component based on the fair value of the debt instrument excluding the conversion feature, with the residual allocated to the equity component and classified in additional paid in capital. The $46.8 million difference between the principal amount of the Convertible Notes ($200.0 million) and the proceeds allocated to the liability component (  $153.2   million) is treated as a discount on the Convertible Notes. This difference is being amortized as non-cash interest expense using the interest method, as discussed below under   Interest Expense  . The equity component, however,   is not subject to amortization nor subsequent remeasurement.  

In addition, ASC 470-20 requires that the debt issuance costs associated with a convertible debt instrument be allocated between the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the debt proceeds between these two components. The debt issuance costs attributable to the liability component of the Convertible Notes ($  5.1   million) are also treated as a discount on the Convertible Notes and amortized as non-cash interest expense. The debt issuance costs attributable to the equity component ($1.5 million) were netted with the equity component and will not be amortized.

The following table presents information related to the liability and equity components of   the Convertible Notes: 

The Convertible Notes, governed by the terms of an indenture between the Company and   Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee,   are unsecured obligations and do not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.875% per year, payable in cash semiannually in June and December. 

Prior to January 15, 2021, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during the   five   business day period after any   ten   consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per   $1,000   principal amount of Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (2) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day  or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after January 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 

The Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of   33.0579   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $30.25  . The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment for some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, the Company is required to increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert   their   Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event including customary conversion rate adjustments in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change    described in the indenture  . Upon conversion, and at the Company s election, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of the following: 

(a) 

Non-cash interest expense produces effective interest rates that are higher than contractual rates; accordingly, the effective interest rates for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2010 Senior   Notes and the Convertible Notes     are   9.86%  ,    7.99%   and   9.39%  , respectively.     

(6)     Contingencies and Commitments 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in litigation and are contingently liable for commitments and performance guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company and certain of its customers have made claims arising from the performance under their contracts. The Company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future   claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, assets and liabilities may change in the future due to various factors. 

Several matters are in the litigation and dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of the more significant matters. 

Long Island Expressway/Cross Island Parkway Matter 

The Company reconstructed the Long Island Expressway/Cross Island Parkway Interchange project for the New York State Department of Transportation (the  NYSDOT ). The   $130   million project was substantially completed in January 2004 and was accepted by the NYSDOT as finally complete in February 2006. The Company incurred significant added costs in completing its work and suffered extended schedule costs due to numerous design errors, undisclosed utility conflicts, lack of coordination with local agencies and other interferences for which the Company believes the NYSDOT is responsible. 

In March 2011, the Company filed its claim and complaint with the New York State Court of Claims and served to the New York State Attorney General s Office, seeking damages in the amount of   $53.8   million. In May 2011, the NYSDOT filed a motion to dismiss the Company s claim on the grounds that the Company had not provided required documentation for project closeout and filing of a claim. In September 2011, the Company reached agreement on final payment with the Comptroller s Office on behalf of the NYSDOT which resulted in an amount of   $0.5   million payable to the Company and formally closed out the project allowing the Company to re-file its claim. The Company re-filed its claim in the amount of $53.8 million with the NYSDOT in February 2012 and with the Court of Claims in March 2012. In May 2012, the NYSDOT served its answer and counterclaims in the amount of   $151   million alleging fraud in the inducement and punitive damages related to disadvantaged business enterprise ( DBE ) requirements for the project.   The Court subsequently ruled that NYSDOT s counterclaims may only be asserted as a defense and offset to the Company s claims and not as affirmative claims. In November 2014, the Appellate Division First Department affirmed

the dismissal of the City s affirmative defenses and counterclaims based on DBE fraud. The Company does not expect the counterclaims to have any material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

Management has made an estimate of the total anticipated recovery on this project, and such estimate is included in revenue recorded to date. To the extent new facts become known or the final recovery included in the claim settlement varies from the estimate, the impact of the change will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements at that time. 

Fontainebleau Matter 

Desert Mechanical Inc. ( DMI ) and Fisk Electric Company ( Fisk ), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, were subcontractors on the Fontainebleau Project in Las Vegas ( Fontainebleau ), a hotel/casino complex with approximately   3,800   rooms. In June 2009, Fontainebleau filed for bankruptcy protection, under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in the Southern District of Florida. Fontainebleau is headquartered in Miami, Florida. 

DMI and Fisk filed liens in Nevada for approximately   $44   million, representing unreimbursed costs to date and lost profits, including anticipated profits. Other unaffiliated subcontractors have also filed liens. In June 2009, DMI filed suit against Turnberry West Construction, Inc., the general contractor, in the 8th Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada (the  District Court ), and in May 2010, the court entered an order in favor of DMI for approximately   $45   million.  

In January 2010, the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the property to Icahn Nevada Gaming Acquisition, LLC, and this transaction closed in February 2010. As a result of a July 2010 ruling relating to certain priming liens, there was approximately   $125   million set aside from this sale, which is available for distribution to satisfy the creditor claims based on seniority. At that time, the total estimated sustainable lien amount was approximately   $350   million. The project lender filed suit against the mechanic s lien claimants, including DMI and Fisk, alleging that certain mechanic s liens are invalid and that all mechanic s liens are subordinate to the lender s claims against the property. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in October 2012 in an advisory opinion at the request of the Bankruptcy Court that lien priorities would be determined in favor of the mechanic lien holders under Nevada law. 

In October 2013, a settlement was reached by and among the Statutory Lienholders and the other interested parties. The Bankruptcy Court appointed a mediator to facilitate the execution of that settlement agreement. Settlement discussions are ongoing. 

Management has made an estimate of the total anticipated recovery on this project, and such estimate is included in revenue recorded to date. To the extent new facts become known or the final recovery included in the claim settlement varies from the estimate, the impact of the change will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements at that time. 

Honeywell Street/Queens Boulevard Bridges Matter 

In 1999, the Company was awarded a contract for reconstruction of the Honeywell Street/Queens Boulevard Bridges project for the City of New York (the  City ). In June 2003, after substantial completion of the project, the Company initiated an action to recover   $8.8   million in claims against the City on behalf of itself and its subcontractors. In March 2010, the City filed counterclaims for   $74.6   million and other relief, alleging fraud in connection with the DBE requirements for the project. In May 2010, the Company served the City with its response to the City s counterclaims and affirmative defenses. In August 2013, the Court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the City s affirmative defenses and counterclaims relating to fraud. 

The Company does not expect ultimate resolution of this matter to have any material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

Westgate Planet Hollywood Matter 

Tutor-Saliba Corporation ( TSC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, contracted to construct a timeshare development project in Las Vegas which was substantially completed in December 2009. The Company s claims against the owner, Westgate Planet Hollywood Las Vegas, LLC ( WPH ), relate to unresolved owner change orders and other claims. The Company filed a lien on the project in the amount of   $23.2   million, and filed its complaint with the District Court, Clark County, Nevada. Several subcontractors have also recorded liens, some of which have been released by bonds and some of which have been released as a result of subsequent payment. WPH has posted a mechanic s lien release bond for   $22.3   million. 

WPH filed a cross-complaint alleging non-conforming and defective work for approximately   $51   million, primarily related to alleged defects, misallocated costs, and liquidated damages. WPH revised the amount of their counterclaims to approximately   $45   million.

Following multiple post-trial motions, final judgment was entered in this matter on March 20, 2014. TSC was awarded total judgment in the amount of   $19.7   million on its breach of contract claim, which includes an award of interest up through the date of judgment, plus attorney s fees and costs. WPH has paid   $0.6   million of that judgment. WPH was awarded total judgment in the amount of   $3.1   million on its construction defect claims, which includes interest up through the date of judgment. The awards are not offsetting. WPH and its Sureties have filed a notice of appeal. TSC has filed a notice of appeal on the defect award. In July 2014, the Court ordered WPH to post an additional supersedeas bond on appeal, in the amount of   $1.7   million, in addition to the lien release bond of   $22.3   million, which increases the security up to   $24.0   million. The Nevada Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this matter. 

The Company does not expect ultimate resolution of this matter to have any material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Management has made an estimate of the total anticipated recovery on this project and such estimate is included in revenue recorded to date. To the extent new facts become known or the final recovery included in the claim settlement varies from the estimate, the impact of the change will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements at that time. 

U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Matter 

Rudolph and Sletten, Inc. ( R S ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a contract with the United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) for the construction of a   287,000   square-foot facility for NOAA s Southwest Fisheries Science Center Replacement Headquarters and Laboratory in La Jolla, California. The contract work began on May 24, 2010, and was substantially completed in September 2012. R S incurred significant additional costs as a result of a design that contained errors and omissions, NOAA s unwillingness to correct design flaws in a timely fashion and a refusal to negotiate the time and pricing associated with change order work. 

R S has filed   three   certified claims against NOAA for contract adjustments related to the unresolved Owner change orders, delays, design deficiencies and other claims. The First Certified Claim was submitted on August 20, 2013, in the amount of   $26.8   million ("First Certified Claim") and the Second Certified Claim was submitted on October 30, 2013, in the amount of   $2.6   million ("Second Certified Claim") and the Third Certified Claim was submitted on October 1, 2014 in the amount of   $0.7   million ( Third Certified Claim ).  

NOAA requested an extension to issue a decision on the First Certified Claim and on the Third Certified Claim, but did not request an extension of time to review the Second Certified Claim. On January 6, 2014, R S filed suit in the United States Federal Court of Claims on the Second Certified Claim plus interest and attorney's fees and costs. This was followed by a submission of a lawsuit on the First Certified Claim on July 31, 2014. In February 2015, the Court denied NOAA s motion to dismiss the Second Certified Claim. In March 2015, the Contracting Officer issued decisions on all Claims accepting a total of approximately   $1.0   million of claims and denying approximately   $29.5   million of claims. On April 14, 2015, the Court consolidated the cases. Trial is scheduled to commence in December 2017. 

Management has made an estimate of the total anticipated recovery on this project, and such estimate is included in revenue recorded to date. To the extent new facts become known or the final recovery included in the claim settlement varies from the estimate, the impact of the change will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements at that time. 

Five Star Electric Matter 

In the third quarter of 2015, Five Star Electric Corp. ("Five Star"), a subsidiary of the Company that was acquired in 2011, entered into a tolling agreement related to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York ( USAO EDNY ). The tolling agreement extended the statute of limitations to avoid the expiration of any unexpired statute of limitations while the investigation is pending. Five Star has been cooperating with the USAO EDNY since late June 2014, when it was first made aware of the investigation, and has been providing information related to its use of certain minority-owned, women-owned, small and disadvantaged business enterprises and, in addition, most recently, information regarding certain of Five Star s employee compensation, benefit and tax practices. The investigation covers the period of 2005-2014. 

The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation and cannot accurately estimate any potential liability that Five Star or the Company may incur or the impact of the results of the investigation on Five Star or the Company.

Alaskan Way Viaduct Matter 

In January 2011, Seattle Tunnel Partners ( STP ), a joint venture between Dragados USA, Inc. and the Company, entered into a design-build contract with the Washington State Department of Transportation (     WSDOT     ) for the construction of a large diameter bored tunnel in downtown Seattle, King County, Washington to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, also known as State Route 99.  

The construction of the large diameter bored tunnel requires the use of a tunnel boring machine ( TBM ). In December 2013, the TBM struck a steel pipe, installed by WSDOT as a well casing for an exploratory well. The TBM was damaged and was required to be shut down for repair. STP has asserted that the steel pipe casing was a differing site condition that WSDOT failed to properly disclose. The Disputes Review Board mandated by the contract to hear disputes issued a decision finding the steel casing was a Type I differing site condition. WSDOT has not accepted that finding. 

The TBM is insured under a Builder s Risk Insurance Policy ( the Policy ) with Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC and a consortium of other insurers (the  Insurers ). STP submitted the claims to the insurer and requested interim payments under the Policy. The Insurers refused to pay and denied coverage. In June 2015, STP filed a lawsuit in the King County Superior Court, State of Washington ( Washington Superior Court ) seeking declaratory relief concerning contract interpretation as well as damages as a result of the Insurers  breach of its obligations under the terms of the Policy. WSDOT is deemed a plaintiff since WSDOT is an insured under the Policy and had filed its own claim for damages. Trial is scheduled for June 2017. The Insurers filed proceedings challenging the venue for the litigation, contending   that   the case should be heard in New York. Those proceedings are not yet concluded but interim rulings upheld STP s jurisdictional position. 

In March 2016, WSDOT refiled the action against STP in Thurston County Superior Court. STP filed its answer to WSDOT s complaint and filed a counterclaim against WSDOT and against the manufacturer of the TBM. Trial is set for June 2018. 

As of September 2016, the Company has concluded that the potential for a material adverse financial impact due to the Insurer s and WSDOT s respective lega  l actions are neither probable nor remote.   With respect to STP s counterclaim, m  anagement has included an estimate of the total anticipated recovery concluded to be both probable and reliably estimable in revenue recorded to date.   To the extent new facts become known or the final recovery included in the claim settlement varies from the estimate, the impact of the change will be reflected in the financial statements at that time. 

(  7  )         Share-Based Compensation 

The Company s share-based compensation plan is described, and informational disclosures are provided, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company issued the following share-based instruments: (1) restricted stock units of     483,387   and   321,500   at weighted-average per share prices of   $19.14   and   $23.  07  , respectively  ; (2)   274,000   and   259,000   stock options at weighted-average   per share   exercise prices of   $16.20   and   $16.  07  , respectively  ; and (3)     64,603   and   68,160   unrestricted stock units at weighted-average per share prices of $  21.67   and $  21.93  , respectively.   Both the restricted stock units and options granted in 2016 and 2015 vest upon the achievement of defined performance targets.

(a) 

Defined benefit pension plan adjustments were reclassified primarily to cost of operations and general and administrative expenses.     

(  9  )       Income Taxes 

The Company s   effective income tax rate   for   the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     was     39.9%   and   40.6%  , respectively, compared to     42.0  %   and   41.1%   for the   same period  s     in 2015.   The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by various return  -  to  -  provision adjustments. 

(  10  )       Fair Value Measurements 

The fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements  , prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 

Level 1     quoted prices in active markets for identical assets   or liabilities 

Level 2   inputs are other than   Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly 

Level 3     unobserv  able inputs 

The following is a summary of financial statement items carried at estimated fair values measured on a recurring basis as of the dates presented: 

(a) 

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist primarily of money market funds with original maturity dates of three months   or less, for which fair value is determined through quoted market prices.

(b) 

Investments in lieu of retainage are classified as account  s    r  eceivable   and are comprised primarily of mo  ney market funds,   U.S. Treasury Notes and other municipal bonds  , the majority of which are rated Aa3 or better. The fair values of the U.S. Treasury Notes and municipal bonds are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments and, as such, the Company has classified these assets as Level 2  .     

(c) 

The Company values the interest rate swap liability utilizing a discounted cash flow model that takes into consideration forward interest rates observable in the market and the counterparty s risk. The Company's only interes  t rate swap contract expired in June 2016.      

The Company did not have transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for either financial assets or liabilities, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The carrying value of receivables, payables and other amounts arising out of normal contract activities, including retainage, which may be settled beyond one year, is estimated to approximate fair value. Of the Company s long-term debt, the fair value of the   2010   Notes was     $302.3   million     and   $305.6   million as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the fair value of the Convertible Notes     was $  207.8   million   as of September 30, 2016; the fair values were determined using Level 1 inputs, specifically current observable market prices. The reported value of the Company s remaining long-term debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates fair value.  

The fair value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes as of the issuance date of June 15, 2016 was $153.2 million, which was determined using a   b  inomial   l  attice approach based on Level 2 inputs, specifically quoted prices in active markets for similar debt instruments that do not have a conversion feature. See Note 5 for additional information related to the Company s Convertible Notes. 

(11)       Business Segments 

The Company offers general contracting, pre-construction planning and comprehensive project management services, including planning and scheduling of manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract. The Company also offers self-performed construction services: site work, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). As described below, our business is conducted through   three   segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors. These segments are determined based on how the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (chief operating decision maker) aggregates business units when evaluating performance and allocating resources. 

The Civil segment specializes in public works construction and the replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure. The civil contracting services include construction and rehabilitation of highways, bridges, tunnels, mass-transit systems, and water management and wastewater treatment facilities. 

The Building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets for private and public works customers, including the high-rise residential, hospitality and gaming, transportation, health care, commercial and government offices, sports and entertainment, education, correctional facilities, biotech, pharmaceutical, industrial and high-tech markets.  

The Specialty Contractors segment specializes in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection systems and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil and building construction projects in the industrial, commercial, hospitality and gaming, and mass-transit end markets. This segment provides the Company with unique strengths and capabilities that allow the Company to position itself as a full-service contractor with greater control over scheduled work, project delivery and risk management.

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discusses   our   financial position   at   September 30  , 2016   and the results of   our   operations for   the three and nine months ended September 30  , 2016   and should be read in conjunction with   the unaudited     C  ondensed   Consolidated     F  inancial   S  tatements and   notes contained herein, and   the audited   consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to   our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provision for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Words such as  achieve  ,     anticipate  ,     assumes  ,     believes  ,     continue  ,     could  ,     estimate  ,     expects,   forecast,   hope  ,     intend  ,     may  ,     plan  ,     potential  ,     predict  ,     should  ,     will  ,     would  ,    variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Although such statements   are based on currently available financial and economic data as well as management s   estimates and expe  ctations  ,     forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from what may be inferred from the forward-looking statements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.     Factors potentially contributing to such differences include, among others: 

A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions;     

Increased competition and failure to secure new contracts;     

Decreases in the level of government spending for infrastructure and other public projects;     

Client cancellations of, or reductions in scope under, contracts reported in our backlog;     

Inaccurate estimates of co  ntract risks, revenue or costs, which may result in lower than anticipated profits, or losses;     

Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings and failure to promptly recover significant working capital invested in projects subject to unresolved legal claims;      

Failure to meet our obligations under our debt agreements;     

The requirement to perform extra, or change order, work, resulting in disputes or claims or adversely affecting our working capital, profits and cash flows;      

Failure to meet contractual schedule requirements, which could result in higher cost  s   and reduced profits or, in some cases, exposure to financial liability for liquidated damages and/or damages to customers;      

Inability to retain key m  embers of our management, to hire and retain personnel required to complete projects or implement succession plans for key officers;      

Possible systems and information technology interruptions;     

Failure of our joint venture partners to perform their venture obligations, which could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us, resulting in reduced profits or losses;     

Failure to comply with laws and regulations related to government contracts;     

Impairments of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets; and     

Civil unrest, security issues, labor conditions and other unforeseeable events in the countries in which we do business, resulting in unanticipated losses.     

Executive Overview 

Consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30  , 2016 wa  s    $1.3   billion and $  3.7   billion, respectively, consistent with revenue for the same periods in 2015. 

Income from construction   operations for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016 w  as   $60.9   mill  ion and   $149.9   million, respectively, an increase of   $21.9   million, or   56%  , and   $59.9   million, or   67%  ,    compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase for   both periods   was principally due to   prior year unfavorable adjustments in the Civil and Building segments, as well as   improved operating performance in the   Civil and   Building segments and lower   corporate   general and administrative expenses.   Improved operating performance in the Specialty Contractors segment also contributed to the increase for the third quarter of 2016.   The prior year third quarter results were impacted by   an   unfavorable adjustment of $2  3  .9 million pertain  ing   to an adverse legal decision related to a long-standing Civil segment litigation matter  .     The prior year nine month period results were impacted by this same adjustment, as well as   unfavorable adjustments in the Building segment   totaling $21.4 million   associated with the estimated cost to complete an office building project in New York.

The effectiv  e tax rate for the three and nine months ende  d September 30, 2016 was   39.9%   and   40.6%  , respectively, compared to 42.0% and 41.1% for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. See     Corporate, Tax and Other Matters   below for a detailed discussion of the changes in the effective tax rate. 

Earnings per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $0.57   and $  1.32  ,    respectively, compared to $0.40 and $0.74 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for both periods ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the same factors mentioned above  , which resulted in   increased income from construction operations.  

Consolidated new awards for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $  0.8   billion and   $3.0   billion, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $3.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Civil and Building segments were the major contributors to the new award activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Consolidated backlog as of September 30, 2016 was   $6.7   billion  , compared to   $7.5 billion as of September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to revenue burn that outpaced new awards over the period   for the Building and Specialty Contractors segments  . As of September 30, 2016, the mix of backlog by segment was approximately   42%  ,    33%   and   25%   for the Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors segments, respectively. 

The following table presents the Company s backlog by business segment, reflecting   changes from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016: 

(a) 

New   awards   consist of the original contract price of projects added to   our   backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts.     

The outlook remains favorable for growth over the next several years. In addition to our large volume of backlog, we expect significant new award activity based on long-term capital spending plans by various state, local and federal customers, favorable budget trends and   popular, often   bipartisan  ,   support   from public and elected officials   for infrastructure investments. In addition, the $305     billion Fixing America s Surface Transportation   Act    (  the    FAST Act   )  , enacted in   December   2015, is expected to provide state and local agencies with federal funding for numerous highway, bridge and mass-transit projects through 2020. Furthermore, several very large, long-duration civil infrastructure programs with which we are already involved are progressing, such as California s High-Speed Rail system and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority s East Side Access project. Planning and early projects are also underway related to Amtrak s Northeast Corridor Improvements, including the Gateway Program, which will eventually bring a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River to connect service between New Jersey and New York s Penn Station. Finally, sustained low interest rates are expected to continue driving spending by private and public customers on building and infrastructure projects.

Results of Segment Operations 

We provide professional services to private and public customers in the fields of construction and construction management, including specialty construction services involving electrical; mechanical; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); plumbing and pneumatically placed concrete primarily in the United States and its territories and in certain other international locations. We have three principal business segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors. More information on these business segments is set forth in  Item 1. Business  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December     31, 2015.

Civil Segment 

Revenue and income from construction operations for the Civil segment are summarized as follows:  

Revenue for the three and   nine months ended September   30, 2016 decreased   15%   and   13%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015  . The decrease fo  r both periods was primarily driven by reduced activity   on   a runway reconstruction project in New York  ,   completed in 2015,   and a   platform project at Hudson Yards in New York  ,     which   is nearing completion.   The decrease was partially offset   by increased activity on a large tunnel project in the state of Washington and a large mass-transit project in California. 

Income from construction operations increased   16%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and increased   7%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Favorable performance on the large mass-transit and tunnel projects noted above   helped to   mitigate   the impact of lower revenue in both periods  . In addition, the Civil segment s prior year third quarter results were impacted by an adverse legal decision pertaining to a long-standing litigation matter for which the Company assumed liability as part of an acquisition in 2011 ($23.9 million), which was partially offset by favorable adjustments on the   above mentioned   runway reconstruction project related to the estimated cost to complete and the achievement of certain performance-based milestones ($13.7 million)  . 

Operating margin was   11.0%   and   10.2%   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 8.0% and 8.3% for the same periods in 2015. The margin increase for both periods was due principally to the factors mentioned above  , which   drove the   decreased revenue and   increased income from construction operations. 

New awards in the Civil segment totaled $  284   million and $  1.3   billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   compared to $222 million and $697 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. New awards in the third quarter included a $107 million highway project in Virginia and a $54 million bridge project in Wisconsin. 

Backlog for the Civil segment was $  2.8   billion as of September 30, 2016,   consistent with the level as of September 30, 2015. The segment continues to experience strong demand reflected in a large pipeline of prospective projects and supported by favorable budget trends, customers  long-term spending plans and the FAST Act. In addition, there is popular, often bipartisan, support from public and elected officials for infrastructure investments. In particular, there are a number of large prospective civil projects that have been bid or will be bidding later in 2016, with subsequent awards anticipated in late 2016 or early 2017. We believe the Civil segment is well positioned to capture its share of these prospective projects, but faces continued strong competition. 

Building Segment 

Revenue and income from construction operations for the Building segment are as follows: 

Revenue for the three and   nine   mon  ths ended September   30, 2016 increased   14%   and   16%  , respectively, compared to the same periods   in 2015. The growth for both periods was primarily driven by increased activity on certain commercial office, hospitality and gaming,   health care,   and retail building projects in California  ,    partially offset by   the impact of a hospitality and gaming project   in Mississippi   completed in 2015. 

Income from construction operations increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   compared to the same periods in 2015. The improvement in both periods was primarily due to unfavorable adjustment  s of $3.8 million and   $  21.4   million   for   the   three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively,   related to changes in the estimates to complete an office building project in New York  , as well as the increased activity discussed above  . 

Operating margin was   2.5%     for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1.4  %    and (0.6)% for the three and nine   months ende  d September   30, 2015. The margin increase   for both periods was primarily due to the reasons discussed above regarding changes in revenue and income from construction operations. 

New awards in the Building segment totaled $  270   million and $  982   million for the t  hree and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   $672 million   and $1  .8 billion for the three and nine months ended September   30  , 20  15. New awards in the third quarter  

31   

Table of Contents  

of 2016 included a $120 million hospitality project in California.     The decrease in new awards for the Building segment was due to the timing of certain large awards received in 2015 and new awards expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2017. 

Backlog for the Building segm  ent was $  2.2   billion as of September 30, 2016  , compared to $2.7 billion as of September 30, 2015. We continue to experience strong demand in the Building segment, as evidenced by a large pipeline of prospective projects. Overall, we expect that demand for building projects will remain strong as a result of customer spending supported by sustained low interest rates; however, reduced demand for luxury condominiums in Florida and New York and commercial office space in New York could affect the segment s prospective projects and the timing of new awards within these end markets. The Building segment is well positioned to capture its share of prospective projects based on its strong customer relationships and a reputation built over many years for excellence in delivering high-quality projects on time and within budget. 

Specialty Contractors Segment 

Revenue and income from construction operations for the Specialty Contractors segment are: 

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased   slightly   compared to the third quarter of 2015, and revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased modestly compared to the same period in 2015. 

Income from construction operations   in  creased   136%     for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the third quarter of   2015. The strong increase was due to improved performance on electrical projects in New York, partially offset by reduced   activity   on certain mechanical projects in California. The   results of the   Specialty Contractors segment     for the third quarter of 2015 were impacted by unfavorable adjustments totaling $13.9 million related to a number of electrical projects in New York, none of which were individually material.   Income from construction operations decreased   11%   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to the same period   in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to nominal   project charges   recorded     in the first six months of 2016   for certain   electrical and mechanical   projects   in New York  . 

Operating margin was   3.3%   and   2.8%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1.4% and 3.1% for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2  015.   The margin changes for each period were primarily due to the reasons discussed above that affected   revenue and   income from construction operations. 

New awards in the Specialty Contractors segment totaled $  206   million and $  660   million for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016  , compared to $236 million and $912     million for the three and nine months ended September   30  , 2015. 

Backlog for the Specialty Contractors segment was $  1.7   billion as of September   30, 2016  , compared to $2.0 billion as of September   30, 2  015. The Specialty Contractors segment has a significant pipeline of prospective projects, with demand for its services supported by strong continued spending on civil and building projects. The segment is well positioned to capture its share of prospective projects based on the size and scale of our business units that primarily operate in New York, Texas, California and Florida and   our   strong reputation for high-quality   specialty contracting   work on large, complex projects. 

Corporate, Tax and Other Matters 

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses 

Corporate general and administrative expenses wer  e $  13.8    m  illion and $  44.0     million during the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016  , compared to   $1  5.7   million and $  51.1     million during the three and nine months ended Septembe  r 30, 201  5. The lower corporate general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were due predominantly to reduced legal expenses. The lower corporate general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2016 were due principally to reduced share-based compensation and legal expenses. 

Other Income (Expense), Interest Expense and Provision for Income Taxes      

32   

Table of Contents  

Othe  r income net decreased   by $  4.2   million and $  0.9   million for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 201  5, primarily due to favorable accrual reductions made in 2015 for contingent consideration related to past business acquisitions.    

Interest expense increased   $3.8   million and $  10.8   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to   cash and non-cash   interest expense on the Convertible Notes issued in June 2016, as well as an increase in non-cash interest expense associated with   fees related to   two amendments to the Company s   2014 Credit Facility  . The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to   the same factors that impacted the third quarter of 2016 and to   higher   net   borrowing rates, which were 99 basis points higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by a $  36.0   million reduction in the Company s average   year-over-year   borrowings.    

The effective income tax rate was   39.9%   and   40.6%   for the   three and   nine months ended September   30, 2016  , compared to   42  .  0% and 41  .  1  % for the comparable periods in   2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by various return  -  to  -  provision adjustments  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liqui  dity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, credit facilities and access to capital markets.   We have a $300 million revolving credit facility, which may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and/or general purposes. We believe that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, together with our unused credit capacity of   $139.3   million as of September 30, 2016 and our cash position, is sufficient to support our operating requirements  .    Additionally, over the long-term we may, from time to time, use excess cash to repurchase our debt. 

Cash and Working Capital 

Cash and cash equiva  lents   were   $170.7   million as   of   September   30, 2016  , compared to   $75.5 million as of December     3  1, 2015. These were comprised of   cash held by us and available for general corporate   purposes of $  84.2   million   and $18.  5   million, respectively, and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures, available only for joint venture-related uses including distributions to joint venture partners,   of   $86.5   million   and $57.  0   million, respectively. In   addition, our restricted cash, held primarily to secure insurance-related contingent obligations,   was $  48.7   million as   of   September   30, 2016  , compared to   $45.9 million as of December     31, 2015. 

During the first nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was   $94.2   million   ($89.6 million of which was generated in the third quarter)  , due   primarily to favorable operating results offset by changes in net investment in working capital. The change in working capital primarily reflects increases in accounts receivable   (both trade accounts receivable and retention)   related to billing activity, partly offset by a reduction of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which management   is continuing   to resolve and collect.   During the third quarter of 2016, trade accounts receivable declined by $49.8 million from the balance at June 30, 2016.   During the first nine months ended September 30, 2015,   $20.7   million in cash was provided from operating activities, primarily   due   to   cash generated   from   earnings sources being mostly   offset by increased net investment in working capital. 

The   $73.5   million   improvement in cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is reflective of improved year-over-year profitability and lower net investment in working capital resulting from improved collections. The improvement in cash generation for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 is even more pronounced when considering there were significant collections by the Company in the first quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of a dispute at CityCenter in Las Vegas and a hospital in Santa Monica. 

During the first nine months of 2016, we used   $12.0   million of cash from investing activities,   due primarily to the acquisition of property and equipment and a $2.9 million increase in restricted cash balances relating to the Company s insurance programs  , compared to   the use of cash of   $25.3   million for   investing activities for the same period of 2015, which were primarily related to the acquisition of property and equipment and a $5.8 million reduction in restricted cash balances. 

For the first nine months of 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was   $13.1   million,   which was   due   primarily to increased net borrowings of $28.4 million, partially offset by $14.9 million in debt issuance costs associated with amendments to   the 2014   Credit Facility and the issuance of $200.0 million Convertible Notes. The net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were used to prepay $125.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan, pay down $69.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our   2014 Revolver   and pay $6.0 million of fees related to the offering.  Net cash used in financing activities for the comparable period of 2015 was   $34.0   million, which was primarily   due   to the pay down of debt under   the 2014 Credit Facility  . 

At September 30, 2016, we had working capital of   $1.2   billion, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of   1.78   and a ratio of debt to equity of   0.52  , compared to working capital of $1.2 billion, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.79 and a ratio of debt to equity of 0.58 at December 31, 2015.

Long-Term Debt 

2014 Credit Facility 

Under our 2014 Revolver  , we had   outstanding borrowings of   $160.5   million as of September 30, 2016 and $158.0 million as of December 31, 2015.   The   2014   Revolver balances reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include unamortized debt issuance cost of $  5.2   million and   $2.2   million, respectively.   We utilized the   2014 Revolver   for letters of credit in the amount of   $0.2   million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

On June 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, (the  Original Facility  ,    with subsequent amendments discussed herein, the    2014   Credit Facility ) with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and a syndicate of other lenders. The   2014 Credit Facility   provides for a $300 million revolving credit facility (the    2014   Revolver ), a $250 million term loan (the  Term Loan ) and a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit up to the aggregate amount of $150 million, all maturing on May 1, 2018. Borrowings under both the   2014   Revolver and the Term Loan bear interest based either on Bank of America s prime lending rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), each plus an applicable margin.  

During the first half of 2016, the Company entered into two amendments to the Original Facility (the  Amendments ): Waiver and Amendment No. 1, entered into on February 26, 2016 ( Amendment No.1 ), and Consent and Amendment No. 2, entered into on June 8, 2016 ( Amendment No. 2 ). In Amendment No. 1, the lenders waived the Company s violation of its consolidated leverage ratio covenant and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. These violations were the result of the Company s financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which included the previously reported $23.9 million non-cash, pre-tax charge related to an adverse ruling on the Brightwater litigation matter in the third quarter of 2015 as well as $45.6 million of pre-tax charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 for various Five Star Electric projects. In Amendment No. 2, the lenders consented to the issuance of the Convertible Notes subject to certain conditions, including the prepayment of $125 million on the Term Loan and the paydown of $69 million on the   2014   Revolver, and consented to a potential sale transaction of one of the Company s business units in its Building segment. 

In addition to the Amendments  provisions discussed above, the Amendments also modified other provisions and added new provisions to the Original Facility, and Amendment No. 2 superseded and modified some of the provisions of Amendment No. 1. The following reflects the more significant changes to the Original Facility and the results of the Amendments that are now reflected in the   2014   Credit Facility. Unless otherwise noted, the changes below were primarily the result of Amendment No. 1: (1) The Company may utilize LIBOR-based borrowings. (Amendment No. 1 precluded the use of LIBOR-based borrowings until the Company filed its compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2016; however, Amendment No. 2 negated this preclusion.) (2) The Company is subject to an increased rate on borrowings, with such rate being 100 basis points higher than the highest rate under the Original Facility if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00 but not more than 4.00:1.00, and an additional 100 basis points higher if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 4.00:1.00. (3) The Company will be subject to increased commitment fees if the Company s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00. (4) The impact of the Brightwater litigation matter is to be excluded from the calculation of the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenants. (5) Interest payments are due on a monthly basis; however, if the Company is in compliance with its consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenants provided in the Original Facility as of December 31, 2016, the timing of interest payments will revert to the terms of the Original Facility. (6) The accordion feature of the Original Facility, which would have allowed either an increase of $300 million in the   2014   Revolver or the establishment of one or more new term loan commitments, is no longer available. (7) The Company s maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio was increased to 4.25:1.00 for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 after which it returns to the Original Facility s range of 3.25:1.00 to 3.00:1.00. (Amendment No. 1 increased the Company s maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio covenant requirements to 4.25:1.00 for the first quarter of 2016 and 4.0:1.0 for the second and third quarters of 2016. Amendment No. 2 increased the maximum allowable consolidated leverage ratio covenant requirements to 4.25:1.00 for the second and third quarters of 2016.) (8) The Company is subject to additional covenants regarding its liquidity, including a cap on the cash balance in the Company s bank account and a weekly minimum liquidity requirement (based on specified available cash balances and availability under the   2014   Revolver). (9) The Company is required to achieve certain quarterly cash collection milestones, which were eased somewhat in Amendment No. 2. (10) The Company is required to make additional quarterly principal payments, which will be applied to the Term Loan balloon payment, with some of the payments based on a percentage of certain forecasted cash collections for the prior quarter. This change will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. (11) The lenders  collateral package was increased by pledging to the lenders (i) the equity interests of each direct domestic subsidiary of the Company and (ii) 65% of the stock of each material first-tier foreign restricted subsidiary of the Company. (12) The   2014   Credit Facility will now mature on May 1, 2018, as opposed to maturity date of the Original Facility of June 5, 2019.

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to claims, asserted or unasserted, or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations.

We do not act as the owner of any mines but we may act as a mining operator as defined under the Mine Act where we may be an independent contractor performing services or construction of such mine. 

Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95.

Executive shall be reimbursed his reasonable fees and costs, including attorneys' fees, in connection with the review, negotiation and execution of this Agreement. 

Section 8.           Confidentiality, Non-Disclosure and Non-Competition Agreement.   The Employer and Executive acknowledge and agree that during Executive's employment with the Employer, Executive will have access to and may assist in developing Confidential Information and will occupy a position of trust and confidence with respect to the Employer's affairs and business and the affairs and business of its Affiliates. Executive agrees that the following obligations are necessary to preserve the confidential and proprietary nature of Confidential Information and to protect the Employer and its Affiliates against harmful solicitation of employees and customers, harmful competition and other actions by Executive that would result in serious adverse consequences for the Employer and any of its Affiliates: 

(a)           Non-Disclosure.   During and after Executive s employment with the Employer, Executive will not knowingly use, disclose or transfer any Confidential Information other than as authorized in writing by the Employer or within the scope of Executive's duties with the Employer. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this   Section 8(a)   shall not apply (i) when disclosure is required by law or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) with actual or apparent jurisdiction to order Executive to disclose or make accessible any information; (ii) to the extent necessary in connection with any other litigation, arbitration or mediation involving this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the enforcement of this Agreement; (iii) as to information that becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Executive's violation of this   Section 8(a);   or (iv) as to information that is or becomes available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a source that is entitled to disclose it to Executive. 

(b)           Materials.   Executive will not remove any Confidential Information or any other property of the Employer or any of its Affiliates from the Employer's premises or make copies of such materials except for normal and customary use in the Employer's business. Executive will return to the Employer all Confidential Information and copies thereof and all other property of the Employer or any of its Affiliates at any time upon the request of the Employer and in any event promptly after termination of Executive's employment. Executive agrees to identify and return to the Employer any copies of any Confidential Information within Executive's control after Executive ceases to be employed by the Employer. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this   Section 8   shall prevent Executive from retaining a home computer, papers and other materials of a personal nature, including diaries, calendars and information relating to his compensation or relating to reimbursement of expenses, information that he reasonably believes may be needed for tax purposes, and copies of plans, programs and agreements relating to his employment. 

4   

(c)           Developments.   Executive shall, promptly upon reasonable request, disclose to the Employer all inventions (whether patentable or not), trade secrets, trademark concepts, and advertising and marketing concepts (collectively, hereinafter referred to as "  Developments  "), that he makes, alone or with others, during his employment with Employer or any of its Affiliates relating to any of their businesses. Employer will exclusively own all Developments. Executive hereby assigns to the Employer all rights that he has or acquires in any Developments, and he will execute any documents and take any actions as reasonably requested by the Employer necessary to effect that assignment. Executive need not incur any cost related to that assignment or the creation of any related intellectual property rights. The parties agree that Developments are Confidential Information. Both during the Employment Period and thereafter, Executive shall fully cooperate with the Employer's reasonable requests in the protection and enforcement of any intellectual property rights that relate to services performed by Executive for the Employer or any of its Affiliates, whether under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. This shall include, upon reasonable request by the Employer, executing, acknowledging, and delivering to Employer all documents or papers that may be necessary to enable Employer to publish or protect such intellectual property rights.     The Employer shall bear all costs in connection with Executive s compliance with the terms of this provision. 

(d)           Cooperation.   During the Employment Period and thereafter Executive will, upon reasonable request and subject to such reasonable condition as Executive may reasonably establish: (a) cooperate with the Employer in connection with any matter that arose during Executive's employment and that relates to the business or operations of the Employer or any of its Affiliates, or of which Executive may have any knowledge or involvement; and (b) consult with and provide information to the Employer and its representatives concerning such matters. Such cooperation shall be rendered at reasonable times and places and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with any other employment in which Executive may then be engaged. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony or affidavit that is not truthful. 

(e)           No Solicitation or Hiring of Employees.   During the Non-Compete Period, Executive shall not solicit, entice, persuade or induce any individual who is employed by the Employer or any of its Affiliates (or who was so employed within 500 days prior to Executive's or Employer's action to terminate) to refrain from continuing such employment or becoming re-employed by Employer, or to become employed by or enter into contractual relations with any other individual, agency or entity other than the Employer or any of its Affiliates, and Executive shall not hire, directly or indirectly, as an employee, consultant or otherwise, any such person. 

(f)              Non-Competition. 

(i)           During the Non-Compete Period, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit or encourage any client or customer of the Employer or any of its Affiliates, or any person or entity who was such a client or customer within 500 days prior to Employer's or Executive's action to terminate, reduce or alter in a manner adverse to the Employer or any of its Affiliates, any existing business arrangements with the Employer or any of its Affiliates or to transfer existing business from the Employer or any of its Affiliates to any other person or entity, (B) provide services in any capacity to any entity if (i) the entity competes with the Employer or  

5   

any of its Affiliates by engaging in any business engaged in by the Employer or any of its Affiliates in any country in which the Employer or its Affiliates engages in such business, or (ii) the services to be provided by Executive are competitive with the Employer and substantially similar to those previously provided by Executive to the Employer or any of its Affiliates; or (C) own an interest in any entity described in subsection (B)(i) immediately above; provided, however, that Executive may own, as a passive investor, securities of any such entity that has outstanding publicly traded securities so long as his direct holdings in any such entity shall not in the aggregate constitute more than 5% of the voting power of such entity. Executive agrees that, before providing services, whether as an employee or consultant, to any entity during the Non-Compete Period, he will provide a copy of this Agreement to such entity, and such entity shall acknowledge to the Employer in writing that it has read this Agreement. Executive acknowledges that this covenant has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Employer, that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood for Executive while such covenant remains in force and that, as a result of the foregoing, in the event that Executive breaches such covenant, monetary damages would be an insufficient remedy for the Employer and equitable enforcement of the covenant would be proper. 

(ii)           If the restrictions contained in   Section 8(f)(i)   shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of their extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of their being too extensive in any other respect,   Section 8(f)(i)   shall be modified to be effective for the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable. 

(g)           Publicity.   During the Employment Period, Executive hereby grants to the Employer the right to use, in a reasonable and appropriate manner, Executive's name and likeness, without additional consideration, on, in and in connection with technical, marketing or disclosure materials, or any combination thereof, published by or for the Employer or any of its Affiliates. Employer shall obtain Executive's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or denied, in connection with the use of Executive's name and likeness. 

(h)           Conflicting Obligations and Rights.   Executive agrees to inform the Employer of any apparent conflicts between Executive's work for the Employer and any obligations Executive may have to preserve the confidentiality of another's proprietary information or related materials before using the same on the Employer's behalf.

(i)           Enforcement.   Executive acknowledges that in the event of any breach of     this   Section     8,   the business interests of the Employer and its Affiliates will be irreparably injured, the full extent of the damages to the Employer and its Affiliates will be impossible to ascertain, monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy for the Employer and its Affiliates, and the Employer will be entitled to enforce this Agreement by a temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of posting bond or security, which Executive expressly waives. Executive understands that the Employer may waive some of the requirements expressed in this Agreement, but that such a waiver to be effective must be made in  

6   

writing and should not in any way be deemed a waiver of the Employer's right to enforce any other requirements or provisions of this Agreement. Executive agrees that each of Executives obligations specified in this Agreement is a separate and independent covenant and that the unenforceability of any of them shall not preclude the enforcement of any other covenants in this Agreement. Executive further agrees that any breach of this Agreement by the Employer prior to the Date of Termination shall not release Executive from compliance with his obligations under this   Section 8,   so along as the Employer fully complies with   Section 10   and   Section 12.

The parties acknowledge and agree that damages which will result to Executive for termination by the Employer of Executive's employment without Cause or by Executive for Good Cause shall be extremely difficult or impossible to establish or prove, and agree that the amounts payable to Executive under   Section 10   shall constitute liquidated damages for any such termination. Executive agrees that, except for such other payments and benefits to which Executive may be entitled as expressly provided by the terms of this Agreement or any other applicable benefit plan, such liquidated damages shall be in lieu of all other claims that Executive may make by reason of any such termination of his employment and that, as a condition to receiving the Severance Payments, Executive will execute a release of claims substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. Within five business days of the Date of Termination, the Employer shall deliver to Executive the appropriate form of release of claims for Executive to execute. The Severance Payments shall be made within three business days of the expiration of the revocation period without the release being revoked and otherwise as they become due.

(h)           Section 409A.   

(i)           Notwithstanding the timing of the payments pursuant to   Section 10   of this Agreement, to the extent Executive would otherwise be entitled to a payment during the six  

9   

months beginning on the Date of Termination that would be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), (i) the payment will not be made to Executive and instead will be made to an account established to fund such payments (provided that such funds shall be at all times subject to the creditors of the Employer) and (ii) the payment, together with interest thereon at the rate of  prime  plus 1%, will be paid to Executive on the six-month anniversary of Date of Termination. Similarly, to the extent Executive would otherwise be entitled to any benefit (other than a cash payment) during the six months beginning on the Date of Termination that would be subject to the additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the benefit will be delayed and will begin being provided (together, if applicable, with an adjustment to compensate Executive for the delay, with such adjustment to be determined in the Employer s reasonable good faith discretion) on the six-month anniversary of the Date of Termination.  The Employer will establish the account, as applicable, no later than ten days after Executive s Date of Termination.   

(ii)           It is the intention of the parties that the payments and benefits to which Executive could become entitled in connection with termination of employment under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code.  In the event that the parties determine that any such benefit or right does not so comply, they will negotiate reasonably and in good faith to amend the terms of this Agreement such that it complies (in a manner that attempts to minimize the economic impact of such amendment on Executive and the Employer and its affiliates). 

(iii)           A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.  

(iv)           For purposes of compliance with Code Section 409A, (i) all expenses or other reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by the Executive, (ii) any right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year. 

(v)           For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. 

(vi)           Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (  e.g.  ,  payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Employer.

During the Employment Period and thereafter, the Employer also shall provide Executive with coverage under its current directors' and officers' liability policy to the same extent that it provides such coverage to its other executive officers. If Executive has any knowledge of any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, as to which Executive may request indemnity under this provision, Executive will give the Employer prompt written notice thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect Executive's right to indemnification. The Employer shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such proceeding and Executive will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such defense. To the extent that Executive in good faith determines that there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Employer and Executive in connection with the defense of a proceeding, Executive shall so notify the Employer and shall be entitled to separate representation at the Employer's expense by counsel selected by Executive (provided that the Employer may reasonably object to the selection of counsel within ten (10) business days after notification thereof) which counsel shall cooperate, and coordinate the defense, with the Employer's counsel and minimize the expense of such separate representation to the extent consistent with Executive's separate defense.

This Release is effective without regard to the legal nature of the claims raised and without regard to whether any such claims are based upon tort, equity, implied or express contract or discrimination of any sort. Except as specifically provided herein, it is expressly understood and agreed that this Release shall operate as a clear and unequivocal waiver by Executive of any claim for accrued or unpaid wages, benefits or any other type of payment. 

19   

2. Executive expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Executive understands the significance of his release of unknown claims and his waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims. 

3. Executive agrees that he will not be entitled to or accept any benefit from any claim or proceeding within the scope of this Release that is filed or instigated by him or on his behalf with any agency, court or other government entity. 

4. The parties agree and acknowledge that the Agreement, and the settlement and termination of any asserted or unasserted claims against the Company and the Company Parties pursuant to this Release, are not and shall not be construed to be an admission of any violation of any federal, state or local statute or regulation, or of any duty owed by the Company or any of the Company Parties to Executive.

(a) That he has read the terms of this Release, and that he understands its terms and effects, including the fact that he has agreed to RELEASE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE the Company and all Company Parties from any legal action or other liability of any type related in any way to the matters released pursuant to this Release other than as provided in the Agreement and in this Release. 

(b) That he understands the significance of his release of unknown claims and his waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims. Accordingly, Executive expressly waives any and all rights and benefits under Section     1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

(c) That he is waiving all rights to sue or obtain equitable, remedial or punitive relief from any or all Company Parties of any kind whatsoever, including, without limitation, reinstatement, back pay, front pay, attorneys  fees and any form of injunctive relief.

(i)           any right that cannot be waived under law, including the right to file an administrative charge or to participate in an administrative investigation or proceeding; provided, however, that he disclaims and waives any right to share or participate in any monetary award resulting from the prosecution of such charge or investigation or proceeding, 

(ii)           any claim for indemnity pursuant to the Company s by-laws, articles of incorporation or Section     11 of the Agreement or  

20   

(iii)           any claim for Accrued Benefits (as defined in the Agreement, [or  

(iv)           claim for benefits pursuant to Sections 10(c) or 10(d)].  

(d) That he has signed this Release voluntarily and knowingly in exchange for the consideration described herein, which he acknowledges is adequate and satisfactory to him and which he acknowledges is in addition to any other benefits to which he is otherwise entitled. 

(e) That he has been and is hereby advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Release. 

(f) That he does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date this Release is executed or those claims arising under the Agreement with respect to payments and other rights due Executive on the date of, or during the period following, the termination of his Employment. 

(g)     That the Company has provided him with adequate opportunity, including a period of twenty-one (21)     days from the initial receipt of this Release and all other time periods required by applicable law, within which to consider this Release (it being understood by Executive that Executive may execute this Release less than 21 days from its receipt from the Company, but agrees that such execution will represent his knowing waiver of such 21-day consideration period), and he has been advised by the Company to consult with counsel in respect thereof. 

(h) That he has seven (7)     calendar days after signing this Release within which to rescind, in a writing delivered to the Company, the portion of this Release related to claims arising under ADEA or any other claim arising under any other federal, state or local law that requires extension of this revocation right as a condition to the valid release and waiver of such claim. 

(i) That at no time prior to or contemporaneous with his execution of this Release has he filed or caused or knowingly permitted the filing or maintenance, in any state, federal or foreign court, or before any local, state, federal or foreign administrative agency or other tribunal, any charge, claim or action of any kind, nature and character whatsoever (   Claim   ), known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which he may now have or has ever had against the Company Parties which is based in whole or in part on any matter referred to in Section 1 above; and, subject to the Company s performance under this Release, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Executive is prohibited from filing or maintaining, or causing or knowingly permitting the filing or maintaining, of any such Claim in any such forum. Executive hereby grants the Company his perpetual and irrevocable power of attorney with full right, power and authority to take all actions necessary to dismiss or discharge any such Claim. Executive further covenants and agrees that he will not encourage any person or entity, including but not limited to any current or former employee, officer, director or stockholder of the Company, to institute any Claim against the Company Parties or any of them, and that except as expressly permitted by law or administrative policy or as required by legally enforceable order he will not aid or assist any such person or entity in prosecuting such Claim.
