1.        ORGANIZATION
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Location Wearable Technology marketplace. GTX owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Global Trek Xploration

across multi mobile device operating systems and continues to launch consumer and enterprise apps.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of GTX have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for interim financial information and applicable regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement
of financial position and results of operations have been included. Our operating results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of GTX Corp and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Going
Concern    

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company has
incurred net losses of $813,771 and $889,948 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has incurred
losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $19,332,834 as of September 30, 2016, and has negative working
capital of $1,061,331 as of September 30, 2016. The Company anticipates further losses in the development of its business.  

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of debt or equity is unknown. The obtainment
of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, or its attainment
of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.  

2.        SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and contingencies. These estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates
related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, tangible and intangible long-term asset
valuation, warranty and other obligations and commitments. Estimates are updated on an ongoing basis and are evaluated based on
historical experience and current circumstances. Changes in facts and circumstances in the future may give rise to changes in
these estimates which may cause actual results to differ from current estimates.  

Fair
Value Estimates    

Pursuant
to the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 820,   Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ,
the Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC No. 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value,
clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the reporting date. ASC No. 820 establishes a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  

Level
1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  

Level
2 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability
through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the asset/liability s anticipated life.  

Level
3 Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs
to the model.  

The
carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.  

Equity
      Securities    

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016,
we received restricted equity securities, which we have classified as  available for sale  securities. Our
equity securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis, with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings
and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income. 

The
inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.  

Following
are the disclosures related to our financial assets pursuant to ASC No. 820:  

The
fair value of our available for sale securities is determined based on quoted market prices for identical securities on a quarterly
basis.  

Derivative
Instruments    

Our
debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as conversion options, which in certain circumstances
may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability.  

Our
derivative instrument liabilities are re-valued at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative
liability recorded as charges or credits to income, in the period in which the changes occur. For bifurcated conversion options
that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, we determine the fair value of these instruments using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the remaining term of the instrument and risk-free rates of return,
our current Common Stock price and expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility of our Common Stock price over the life
of the option.  

Reclassifications    

For
comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified, where appropriate, to conform to the financial statement presentation
used in 2016. These reclassifications have no impact on net loss.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently issued accounting pronouncements, most of which represent technical corrections
to the accounting literature or application to specific industries, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not believe that the adoption of any recently issued accounting
standards will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.  

3.        JOINT
VENTURE AND   INVESTMENT IN EQUITY SECURITIES     

On
June 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC ( Inventergy ), a
subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). The Company partnered with Inventergy to monetize three (3) GTX Patents.
Upon signing the Agreement, the Patents were assigned to an Inventergy subsidiary, and Inventergy assigned a 45% interest in the
entity to GTX. Inventergy is also obligated to make a sequence of quarterly payments to GTX in 2017, which payments represent
non-refundable advances against future royalty and other payments. Pursuant to a non-exclusive license back to GTX, GTX will still
retain all use rights of the 3 patents.  

In addition to the Definitive Agreement, the
Company entered into a Consulting Agreement with Inventergy for a period of eighteen months. The Company was issued 42,500 shares
of restricted common stock of INVT, of which 1/6 th  of the stock vests at the close of each calendar quarter and Inventergy
agreed to make five monthly payments to GTX totaling $250,000 through December 2016 as compensation. As of September 30, 2016,
$125,000 of the cash compensation had been recognized. As of September 30, 2016, we owned 42,500 shares of restricted common
stock of INVT valued $63,325. 

The Company uses the equity method to account
for its investment in the Inventergy subsidiary. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its share of the earnings and
losses of the subsidiary as they accrue instead of when they are realized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investment
in the subsidiary was $0. 

4.        RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

In
order to preserve cash for other working capital needs, various officers and members of management have agreed to accrue, and
defer payment of, portions of their salaries since fiscal 2011.  

On
September 30, 2016 management has elected to transfer accrued salaries into long-term convertible promissory notes, due on December
31, 2018, the total amount of salaries converted was $318,671. The notes will bear a 10% annual interest rate. Management shall
have the right, but not the obligation to convert up to 50% of the amount advanced and accrued interest into shares, warrants
or options of common or preferred stock of the Company at $0.01 per share.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company owed
$295,131 and $291,451, respectively for such accrued wages. 

5.        DEBT    

The
following table summarizes the components of our short-term borrowings:  

On
January 15, 2016, we received an additional installment of $15,000 from an accredited investor relating to the 7.5% Convertible
Debenture entered into on October 9, 2015. On April 15, 2016, this note was sold to a private investor pursuant to the Exchange
Agreement as described below.  

On
January 27, 2016, pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement with an unaffiliated third party (the  Investor ) relating
to the sale of an unsecured convertible promissory note and warrant. The third party purchased an additional unit for $25,000
and a principal balance of $30,000. The convertible promissory note is divided into units ( Units ), each in the principal
amount of $30,000, with equal installments of $1,000 due sequentially every week until $30,000 has been repaid and warrants to
purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.015 per share. The convertible promissory notes are due on
November 25, 2016, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the notes. The convertible promissory note has
a relative fair value of $23,899 and the warrants has a relative fair value of $6,101 at the date of issuance determined using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair market value are as follows: (i) risk-free
interest rate of 0.88% (ii) estimated volatility of 171% (iii) dividend yield of 0.00% and (iv) expected life of the warrants
of 25 months. The convertible note is convertible into shares of common stock based on the volume weighted average of the closing
price per share for the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the conversion date if there is any outstanding principal balance
due after the expiration due date. As of September 30, 2016, $5,000 cash installment payments have been made toward lowering the
outstanding principal balance. On September 14, 2016, we consolidated all of these Investor s notes into a single note valued
at $120,000. The note is due December 16, 2016 and carries an OID of 20%.  

On
February 5, 2016, an accredited investor with a convertible note of $30,000, converted their outstanding principal balance into
2,250,000 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.015.  

On
February 8, 2016, we entered into a Note and Share Purchase Agreement with an unaffiliated third party (the  Investor )
relating to the sale of an unsecured convertible promissory note. The convertible promissory note is divided into units ( Units ),
each in the principal amount of $30,000. The notes are due on December 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and restrictions
set forth in the notes. The convertible notes are convertible into shares of common stock at $0.01 per share. On February 8, 2016
the Investor purchased two $25,000 units (for a total of $50,000).  

During
the period ended September 30, 2016, we made a cash payment of $23,000 to an accredited investor to reduce the outstanding balance
on his loans.  

On
March 16, 2016, we entered into a Loan Agreement with an independent accredited investor relating to the sale of a convertible
promissory note and warrant. As a result, we issued convertible notes with a total principal balance of $55,000 and warrants to
purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0125 per share. The convertible promissory note has a relative
fair value of $33,379 and the warrants has a relative fair value of $21,621 at the date of issuance determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair market value are as follows: (i) risk-free interest rate of 1.05%
(ii) estimated volatility of 221% (iii) dividend yield of 0.00% and (iv) expected life of the warrants of 3 years. The Convertible
Note carries an original issue discount of 10%, mature on March 16, 2017 with a 12% interest rate and are convertible into common
stock of the Company at 60% of the lowest closing price over a five day period immediately prior to but not including the Conversion
Date. However, the conversion price shall not be lower than $0.005 per share.

On

2016 and October 15, 2016, respectively. Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, the Investor has agreed not to sell any shares
acquired from conversion of the Note until May 10, 2016. The convertible notes are convertible into shares of common stock at

relating to the sale of an unsecured convertible promissory note. The third party purchased an additional unit for $25,000 and
a principal balance of $30,000. The convertible promissory note is divided into units ( Units ), each in the principal
amount of $25,000, with equal installments of $1,000 due sequentially every week until $30,000 has been repaid. The convertible
promissory notes are due on December 2, 2016, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the notes. The convertible
note is convertible into shares of common stock based on the volume weighted average of the closing price per share for the 20
consecutive trading days prior to the conversion date if there is any outstanding principal balance due after the expiration due
date. On June 14, 2016, we consolidated all of these Investor s notes into a single note valued at $120,000. The note is
due December 16, 2016 and carries an OID of 20%.  

On May 10, 2016, we issued a total of 8,201,811
shares of common stock to two investors upon the conversion of $50,000 in debt from Convertible Notes that were issued
in the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. 

On
June 7, 2016, we issued a total of 6,500,000 shares of common stock to an investor upon the conversion of $23,888 in debt from
a Convertible Note that was issued in the second quarter of 2016.  

On
June 14, 2016, we received $45,000 from a noteholder who consolidated the remaining balance of $55,000 in notes into a $100,000
convertible note with an OID of 20%. The convertible note matures on December 16, 2016, without interest, and is convertible into
common stock of the Company at the lowest traded price in the 5 days prior to the conversion. The noteholder will received 2,000,000
shares of common stock for the origination of this loan. These shares were issued on August 5, 2016.  

On
June 28, 2016, a noteholder assigned his remaining balance of $60,000 to another investor who consolidated it with that investor s
$40,000 convertible note. The new convertible note matures on December 31, 2016, without interest, and is convertible into common
stock of the Company at the lower of 49% of the lowest traded price in the prior 30 days or $0.005 per share. On July 25, 2016,
the noteholder converted their outstanding principal balance into 16,773,833 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.003577
per share.  

On
July 8, 2016, we raised $150,000 related to a Warrant and Note Purchase Agreement with unaffiliated third parties (the  Investors )
relating to the sale of unsecured convertible promissory notes. The promissory notes are divided into
units ( Units ), each in the principal amount of $31,500. The Convertible Note carries an original issue discount
of 26%, mature on December 31, 2017 and are convertible into common stock of the Company at $0.015 per share, subject to adjustment
and mandatory conversion. On July 8, 2016, the Investors had purchased the minimum raise required of six $25,000 Units (for a
total of $150,000). The Agreement comes with two 3-year warrants, one to purchase 1,050,000 shares of common stock at $0.015 per
share and the other to purchase 525,000 shares of common stock at $0.03 per share. The convertible promissory notes have a relative
fair value of $134,019 and the warrants have a relative fair value of $54,981 at the date of issuance determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair market value are as follows: (i) risk-free interest rate of 0.71%
(ii) estimated volatility of 200% (iii) dividend yield of 0.00% and (iv) expected life of the warrants of 3 years.  

On July 10, 2016, we issued a total of 5,000,000

a Convertible Note that closed in the first quarter of 2016.  

Derivative
liabilities    

The conversion features embedded in the convertible
notes were evaluated to determine if such conversion feature should be bifurcated from its host instrument and accounted for as
a freestanding derivative. In the convertible notes with variable conversion terms, the conversion feature was accounted
for as a derivative liability. The derivatives associated with the term convertible notes were recognized as a discount to the
debt instrument and the discount is amortized over the expected life of the notes with any excess of the derivative value over
the note payable value recognized as additional interest expense at the issuance date. Amortization of the debt discount totaled
$623,675 and $0 during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The
derivative liability was calculated using the Black Scholes method over the expected terms of the convertible debentures, with
a risk free rate of 2% and volatility of 107% as of September 30, 2016. Included in Derivative Income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations is income arising from the change in fair value of the derivatives of $537,738 and $13,490 during the
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Introduction

Unless
otherwise noted, the terms  GTX Corp , the  Company ,  we ,  us , and  our 
refer to the ongoing business operations of GTX Corp and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Global Trek Xploration, and LOCiMOBILE,
Inc. During part of the first quarter of 2015, we owned Code Amber News Service, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that was discontinued
in February 2015. Accordingly, unless otherwise specified, references to the  Company ,  we ,  us ,
and  our  for periods before February 2015 also refer to, and include Code Amber News Service, Inc.  

Operations   

GTX
Corp and its subsidiaries (Global Trek Xploration, Inc. and LOCiMOBILE, Inc.) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing,
distribution and sales of five (5) related products and services in the GPS and BLE wearable technology personal location and
wandering assistive technology business. Through a proprietary enterprise (IoT) monitoring platform and licensing subscription
business model, the Company offers a complete end to end solution of hardware, middleware, apps, connectivity, licensing and professional
services, letting you know where or how someone or something is at the touch of a button, delivering safety, security and peace
of mind in real-time.  

Overview   

Since
the start of 2015 the Company has focused on building channels of distribution for its product lines of embedded devices, Stand-Alone
devices and Digital Apps which all funnel into the GTX Corp IoT monitoring platform. Each product line is sold both direct to
consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) through a global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, nonprofit organizations,
government agencies, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels
and, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 35 countries, had 8
regional sales reps in the US, 6 retired and active professional athlete brand ambassadors, over 300 online affiliates, 15 international
and domestic distributors, and a joint venture distribution agreement in Ireland. Also we were issued a vendor numbers and/or
orders for reimbursement in 6 U.S. states, and have applied for other State and Federal reimbursement codes, grants and private
insurance reimbursement, which if granted is expected to increase the potential market for users of our SmartSole product line.
All product lines are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription or licensing service plans ranging from $5 to $49
per month with close to 2,500 worldwide subscribers as of September 30, 2016.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, GTX Corp applied for and was assigned a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number from the
National Plan Provider Enumeration System. The NPI is a unique identification number for covered health care providers. The Centers
for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) to assign these
unique identifiers and as outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), covered providers
must also share their NPI with other providers, health plans, clearinghouses, and any entity that may need it for billing purposes.
Having an NPI number should further facilitate our ability to sell our SmartSoles for elderly and other persons who need this
product for medical purposes, and to comply with the billing requirements of government agencies and insurance providers.  

We
have been modifying and upgrading our modules of our SmartSoles GPS tracking product to, among other things, make it available
for use in various localities without customization. We refer to the modified/upgraded versions as versions 1.25, 1.5, etc. 450
of our last 500 units of our version 1.25 GPS modules devices that were assembled for use in SmartSoles the second fiscal quarter
of 2016 were deployed into the marketplace in this third quarter of 2016. During this current quarter, we went into our third
and fourth production runs of version 1.25 of our SmartSole modules, and are expecting delivery of 250 units in November and 500
units in December. We also placed an order for 300 units of version 1.5 with an expected delivery in January 2017. The production
and roll-out of version 1.5 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a significant advancement for us on many levels. First
we no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors with their Sim cards, so our manufacturing cost
and time lines are reduced and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers  requirements. Second we are now able
to bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to both produce a product
that is able to be delivered to foregign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will
enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber) which is continuing to trend up from last year.  

During
Q1, after having been granted our third patent in our  286  family of patents, we began actively exploring a monetization
campaign. During Q2 2016 the Company signed an agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC ( Inventergy ), a subsidiary
of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). Under the agreement, Inventergy will spearhead a monetization campaign for the three
 286  GTX patents. Part of Inventergy s strategy will be to require potential infringers of these patents to
either license the use of the patents or sell to the patents to third parties that operate in related industries. Upon the signing
of the Inventergy agreement, the three patents were assigned to an Inventergy subsidiary. In exchange for this assignment, GTX
received a 45% interest in the Inventergy subsidiary. The Inventergy subsidiary granted GTX a non-exclusive license to
use the three  286  patents. Accordingly, GTX will still retain all use rights of the 3 patents in GTX s products.  

All
three of the GTX Corp patents are not limited to any particular form factor and are applicable to any generic tracking device,
which, in its simplest form includes a communication device (i.e. cell phone modem, blue tooth or Wi-Fi communicator), a location
detector (i.e. GPS or Wi-Fi Module) and data memory. This technology is now commonly embedded in millions of devices and deployed
across numerous industries.  

The
potential value of these 3 patents is that they extend far beyond our core footwear patents and into areas such as GPS watches,
fitness wearables that track location, hand-held GPS devices, tracking apps on Smartphones, standalone GPS tracking devices and
location based platforms in general, which represents a very sizable addressable market.  

Upon signing the agreement with Inventergy
Innovations, LLC, its parent company, Inventergy Global, Inc., issued to GTX 42,500 restricted shares of Inventergy Global,
Inc. common stock, having an initial value of $62,479, and a series of monthly cash payments totaling $250,000 through December
2016 as payment for consulting services. The restricted shares of common stock vests at a rate of 1/6 th  at the close
of each calendar quarter. Inventergy has also paid us $50,000 this quarter in cash and $75,000 in October 2016 as part
of an overall payment schedule of fees due to GTX throughout the remainder of 2016. Starting in 2017, we expect a quarterly draw
from the joint subsidiary against any future licensing revenues or possible sale of the patents that Inventergy is working to
monetize. 

In Q3, we delivered a prototype of our new
proprietary tracking device for military use, on a non-cellular, encrypted GPS technology platform.  These new devices are
being developed for large scale installations and bases that need to monitor the location and movement of every asset (both human
and non-human on that base, but due to the remote location of these bases and lack of conventional cellular coverage the
devices utilize RF technology and are in a hardened military grade encasement.  In preparation for developing an ongoing
relationship with the military, we have applied for and received a System for Award Mangement (SAM) number and a General Services
Administration (GSA) number and approval for SENSENET. We have shipped a small order of this prototype product to the military.
Based on the feedback we have received from our customer, subject to budget approval, we may receive additional orders, possibly
as early as in the fiscal quarter ended March 2017. 

In
our ongoing strategy to expand our SmartSole target market beyond senior citizens and towards young adults with autism and with
the recent study that claims 1/3 of autistic youngsters wander, last quarter we brought on a new advisor - Lynette Louise an Internationally
renowned Brain Expert with two board certifications in neurotherapy and author of several books. We are currently working with
Lynette to begin offering workshops and consultations for families caring for a child on the far extreme of the ASD spectrum.
This new initiative is intended to strengthen our role and presence in the autistic community and to expand our product offerings
in our online store. This initiative is expected to launch in the 4 th  quarter of 2016.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes that
appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 ( Q2 2016 ) Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 ( Q2 2015 )    

Revenues   

Revenues
during Q3 2016 increased by 99% or $119,930 in comparison to Q3 2015 primarily due to $100,000 of consulting fees we received
from Inventergy related to our proposed monetization of three patents in our IP portfolio, and to the increase in subscribers
and higher revenues per subscriber (RPS). SmartSoles revenues increased due to our ability to have an embedded SIM card in our
devices. Revenues from the sale of GPS SmartSoles in Q3 2015 accounted for approximately 62% of total revenues, in comparison
to Q3 2016 SmartSole sales accounted for approximately 35% of total revenues. The increase in revenues (excluding the Inventergy
payments) stems from a diverse product line and increase in recurring licensing and subscription service fees. We also had an
increase in direct to consumer sales at a higher margin, increasing overall profits and increase in revenues per subscriber (RPS)
as our consumer subscribers pay the higher retail price ranging from $25 to $49 per month and our B2B customers pay the wholesale
price of $5 to $18 per month. The balance of the revenue for the second quarter of 2016 represented sales of stand-alone units,
monthly service plans, licensing fees and App downloads.  

Cost
of goods sold   

Cost
of goods sold decreased 9% or $8,496 during Q3 2016 in comparison to Q3 2015 primarily due to increase in buying and manufacturing
efficiencies. Total gross margin increased from 24% in Q3 2015 to 65% in Q3 2016, which reflects more revenue being derived from
higher margin products and services and the consulting fees from Inventergy (there were no costs associated with that payment).
As we increase our subscription base of monthly recurring fees, total overall gross margins are expected to increase accordingly.  

Wages
and professional fees   

Wages
and professional fees during Q3 2016 decreased 24% or $84,397 in comparison to Q3 2015 primarily due a reduction
in stock based compensation to consultants and advisors.  

General
and administrative   

General
and administrative expenses during Q3 2016 increased 42% or $15,876 in comparison to Q3 2015 primarily due to an increase in business,
customers and subscribers.  

Other
income (expense), net   

Other
income, net decreased by 111% or $105,723 from Q3 2015 to Q3 2016 primarily as a result of costs associated in 2015
with debt financings, and the loss on the retirement of debt and the gain from the extinguishment of debt of $137,250. No such
costs were realized in the same quarter in 2016. Other expense includes interest expenses related to notes, derivative income/loss,
amortization of debt discount, and exchange gains or losses. The accounting treatment for the bifurcation of the derivative liabilities
embedded in our short-term convertible notes results in a net derivative, non-cash income of $215,502. The net derivative expense
represents the change in fair value of the derivative liability during the period as well as the amortization of the related debt
discount.  

Net
loss   

Net
loss decreased by 34% or $91,224 from Q3 2015 to Q3 2016 primarily as a result of increased sales of SmartSoles,
recurring monthly subscriptions and the revenue from the consulting income with Inventergy, and a decrease in total operating
expenses.  

Nine
months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

Revenues
during the first nine months of 2016 increased by 27% or $107,874 in comparison to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the
consulting fees and revenues related to the recognition of the value of the common stock received from Inventergy,
the increase in subscribers and higher revenues per subscriber (RPS), and our first military shipment. Revenues from the sale
of GPS SmartSoles in Q3 2015 accounted for approximately 72% of total revenues, in comparison to Q3 2016 SmartSole sales
accounted for approximately 38% of total revenues, reflecting an increase in revenue streams from a diverse product line and recurring
licensing and subscription service fees. We also had an increase in direct to consumer sales at a higher margin, increasing overall
profits and increase in revenues per subscriber (RPS) as our consumer subscribers pay the higher retail price ranging from $25
to $49 per month and our B2B customers pay the wholesale price of $5 to $18 per month. The balance of the revenue for the second
quarter of 2016 represented sales of stand-alone units, monthly service plans, consulting fees and App downloads.  

Cost
of goods sold   

Cost
of goods sold decreased 24% or $67,732 during the first nine months of 2016 in comparison to the same nine month period in 2015
primarily due increased in operational efficiencies. Total gross margin increased from 27% in the 2015 period to 56% in 2016,
which reflects higher margins realized from the sale of the GPS SmartSole and consulting fees from Inventergy (there were
no costs associated with that payment). We expect that overall gross margins will continue to increase slightly as the higher
margin service subscription revenues increase.  

Wages
and professional fees   

Wages and professional fees during the first nine months of 2016 decreased by 12%
or $106,933 in comparison to the 2015 period despite increased staff, primarily due to increased operational efficiencies.
 Professional fees are expected to increase as we grow our business and expand our products into the wearable technology
marketplace both in the U.S. and internationally. 

General
and administrative   

General
and administrative expenses during the first nine months of 2016 decreased 0.1% or $95 in comparison to the 2015 period despite
the increase in sales and other activities. However, such expenses may increase in the future if our operations increase in accordance
with our business plan.  

Other
income/(expense), net   

Other income, net decreased by 525%
or $206,457, from the first nine months of 2015 to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in costs associated with debt
financings, and the loss on the retirement of debt and the gain from the extinguishment of debt of $137,250 realized in the same
quarter in 2015, but not in 2016. Other income/expense includes interest expenses related to notes, derivative income/loss,
amortization of debt discount, and exchange gains or losses. The accounting treatment for the bifurcation of the derivative liabilities
embedded in our short-term convertible notes results in a net derivative, non-cash income of $537,738. The net derivative expense
represents the change in fair value of the derivative liability during the period as well as the amortization of the related debt
discount. 

Net
loss   

Net loss for the respective nine
month period decreased from 2015 to 2016 by $76,177, or 9%, primarily as a result of increased sales of
SmartSoles, recurring monthly subscriptions and the revenue from the consulting agreement with Inventergy, as a direct result of the higher margin revenues and better operational
efficiencies. The loss from operations decreased by a larger amount, or 30%, but the inclusion of losses related to
derivative expenses, and increased interest expense reduced the net result. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $29,945 of cash and cash equivalents, and a working capital deficit of $1,061,331, compared
to $7,868 of cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $1,127,492 as of December 31, 2015.  A large part
of our negative working capital position at September 30, 2016 consisted of $295,131 of amounts due to officers and management
of the Company for accrued wages, and $626,303 related to the principal balance of unsecured convertible promissory notes,
net of discount.  As further described below, since September 30, 2016, we have received a total of $444,500 from the sale
of unsecured convertible promissory notes.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $813,771, compared to a net loss of $889,948 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  Net cash used in operating activities for Q3 2016 and Q2 2015 was $392,617 and $506,701, respectively.
 Net cash used in operations was lower in Q3 2016 as compared to Q3 2015 because of non-cash expenses relating to stock issued
for services.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities during Q3 2016 was $421,500 and consisted primarily of proceeds totaling $444,500 received
from advances under various convertible note payable agreements as well as payments on Convertible Notes. Net cash provided by
financing activities during Q3 2015 was $509,500 and consists of proceeds totaling $512,500 received from advances under a convertible
note payable agreement.  

Because revenues from our operations have,
to date, been insufficient to fund our working capital needs, we currently rely on the cash we receive from both our financing
activities and the Inventergy payments to fund our capital expenditures and to support our working capital requirements The sale
of the SmartSole product, and the recurring revenues that we will receive from users, is expected to enhance our liquidity during
the balance of 2016 and 2017, although the amount of revenues we receive in these periods cannot be estimated. We also expect
to receive periodic cash payments under our patent monetization agreement with Inventergy. These payments, if they continue, will
supplement or liquidity needs, but will not be sufficient to fund our expected cash needs in 2016 unless SmartSole revenues increase
substantially. Inventergy has the right to terminate our agreement at any time. We also are entitled to receive 45% of third party
payments that Inventergy receives from third parties upon the sale or licensing of our patent rights. Because it is uncertain
if, or when, we will ever receive any payments from third parties related to the license or purchase of our patent rights, we
have not included any such payments in our financial budgets. 

Until
such time as the SmartSoles revenues can support our working capital requirement, we expect to continue to generate ancillary
revenues from our other licenses, Track My Work Force subscriptions, international distributors, hardware sales, professional
services and new customers in the pipeline. However, the amount of such revenues is unknown and is not expected to be sufficient
to fund our working capital needs. For our internal budgeting purposes, we have assumed that such revenues will not be sufficient
to fund all of our planned operating and other expenditures in 2016 and early 2017. In addition, our actual cash expenditures
may exceed our planned expenditures, particularly if we invest in the development of improved versions of our existing products
and technologies, and if we increase our marketing expenses. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will have to continue to raise
additional capital in order to fund our operations in 2016. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the additional
funding we need to continue our operations.  

In
order to continue funding our working capital needs and our product development costs, during the third quarter of 2016 we entered
into 3 separate note and share purchase agreements with 3 independent accredited investors. As a result, we issued convertible
notes with a total principal balance of $189,000 for cash proceeds of $150,000.  

The
licensing agreements, distribution agreements and product sales initiatives we have in place have, to date, have not generated
enough revenues to cover all of our operational expenses. No assurance can be given that our current contractual arrangements
and the revenues from our GPS SmartSoles, device sales, subscriptions, software licensing, or our smart phone or tablet Apps will
generate significant revenues during the balance of 2016.  

In
addition to continuing to incur normal operating expenses, we intend to continue our research and development efforts for our
technologies and products, including hardware, software, interface customization, and website development. We expect to further
develop our sales, marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization, licensing and sales of our GPS
devices and technology. We currently do not have sufficient capital on hand to fully fund our inventory requirements, marketing,
advertising and future product development, which lack of and inconsistencies in the timing and amount of fundings may negatively
affect our future revenues.  

As
noted above, based on budgeted revenues and expenditures, unless revenues increase significantly, we believe that our existing
and projected sources of liquidity (including the minimum periodic payments we will receive from Inventergy while our agreement
is in effect) may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months. Accordingly, we will need to
raise additional funds in 2016 and 2017. The sale of additional equity securities will result in additional dilution to our existing
stockholders. Sale of debt securities could involve substantial operational and financial covenants that might inhibit our ability
to follow our business plan. Any additional funding that we obtain in a financing is likely to reduce the percentage ownership
of the Company held by our existing security-holders. The amount of this dilution may be substantial based on our current stock
price, and could increase if the trading price of our common stock declines at the time of any financing from its current levels.
We may also attempt to raise funds through corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional
funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we may be required to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to
us. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable
to obtain the needed additional funding, we may have to further reduce our current level of operations, or may even have to totally
discontinue our operations.  

Since
inception in 2002, we have generated significant losses. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $19,332,834,
and we currently expect to incur continued losses until our revenue initiatives collectively generate substantial revenues.

DEFINITIVE
AGREEMENT    

Effective
as of June 16, 2016 ( Effective Date ), this definitive agreement ( Agreement ) is entered into by and between
Inventergy Innovations, LLC, Inc., a California Limited Liability Corporation with a place of business at 900 E. Hamilton Avenue,
Suite 180, Campbell, CA 95008 ( Inventergy ), and Global Trek Xploration, a California Corporation with a place of business
at 117 W. 9TH Street, Suite 1214, Los Angeles, California 90015 ( GTX ); each of these entities is to be considered
a  Party  to this Agreement.  

1.
 RECITALS    

WHEREAS:  

GTX
    owns a number of patents and patent applications;   

Inventergy
    has expertise in intellectual property monetization; and   

The
    Parties wish to establish a relationship where GTX s Patents (defined below) will be assigned to an Entity (also defined
    below) for purposes of monetization, with terms specified below governing issues relating to the establishment and management
    of this Entity, and associated revenue share;   

NOW,
THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows.  

2.
 SUMMARY    

This
summary is provided as an aid to understanding the Agreement; in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the terms set
forth below, the terms which follow this summary are to predominate.  

GTX
is engaging Inventergy to monetize GTX s Patents. Upon signing this Agreement, the Patents identified in Exhibit A will be assigned
to an Inventergy subsidiary (i.e., the Entity), with Inventergy assigning a 45% interest in the Entity to GTX and also making
a sequence of payments to GTX (identified in Section 4.4 below). Monetization will be controlled by Inventergy as the managing
party, with Inventergy either consulting with GTX or required to obtain approval of GTX for specified actions.  

Once
this Agreement is signed, GTX will not be able to terminate this Agreement unless (a) the patent monetization efforts should fail
to meet specified License Goals (defined below), or (b) Inventergy should materially breach its obligations to GTX. The payments
specified above and in Section 4.4 below represent a walk-away obligation of Inventergy limit of liability, subject to payment
of any GTX s share of any actually-collected royalties for monetization efforts substantially launched or completed prior to termination.
Should this Agreement be terminated, Inventergy shall cause the Entity to transfer the patents listed in Exhibit A back to GTX
or GTX s designee.

 PATENT TRANSFER; ENTITY OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT    

4.1  
        Patent
    Transfer.   GTX hereby assigns all right, title and interest in and to the Patents, on a worldwide basis, to the Entity.
    GTX further agrees to confirm such assignment using a form substantially similar to that appearing in Exhibit B, which it
    will execute concurrently with entry into this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, the Parties stipulate that such assignment
    conveys to the Entity all right, title and interest in and to the Patents, including the exclusive right to sue and the exclusive
    right to grant licenses under the Patents, and right to recover future and past damages for infringement, and that GTX retains
    no right to grant licenses to or to sue for infringement of the Patents, whether for past damages or otherwise. In connection
    with such Assignment, and in future support of monetization efforts by the Entity, GTX agrees to execute such additional documentation
    and to take other acts as reasonably deemed necessary by Inventergy and/or the Entity in order to assign the Patents in the
    Entity and to record the Entity s interest in the Patents, and to otherwise cooperate as necessary in the prosecution, maintenance
    and assertion of the Patents by the Entity. Further, the obligation of GTX to assign Patents on an ongoing basis is expressly
    agreed to be a continuing obligation for GTX inventions that result from collaboration with Inventergy (or the Entity). Such
    inventions are to be assigned to the Entity under the terms of this Agreement. In addition, any Inventergy inventions as a
    result of collaboration with GTX as well as any patents or patent applications derived from the specifications of the initial
    transferred intellectual property listed in Exhibit A will also be assigned to the Entity under the terms of this Agreement.

4.2  
        Entity
    Ownership.   Inventergy hereby transfers to GTX a forty-five percent (45%) ownership interest in the Entity to GTX as
    of the Effective Date. Inventergy shall retain a fifty-five (55%) ownership interest in the Entity following the Effective
    Date.    

4.3  
        Entity
    Management.   The Entity shall act as a holding company for the Patents and shall be managed by Inventergy as follows.

4.3.1  
      Inventergy
    shall have exclusive responsibility for direction of, and sole control over, the Entity s actions related to (a) prosecution
    of the Patents, in all jurisdictions (including without limitation, country selection, claims selection and preparation and
    filing of continuation/divisional filings), (b) selection of counsel to represent the Entity, (c) maintenance of the Patents,
    (d) licensing of the Patents (other than for exclusive licenses, see below), and related negotiation and terms, (e) assertion
    of any of the Patents, including decisions on parties to approach and any litigation and/or settlement relating to the Patents,
    and (f) any other litigation or action involving any of the Patents, including without limitation the conduct and/or settlement
    or resolution of any inter-partes reexamination, declaratory judgment action or other proceeding relating to the validity
    and/or infringement of a Patent; GTX s approval will not be required for any of these things. However, notwithstanding the
    foregoing, Inventergy will use reasonable efforts to confer with GTX prior to consummation of licenses by the Entity, and
    prior to institution by the Entity of any litigation for infringement of the Patents. Inventergy shall be responsible for
    fronting all expenses relating to (a)-(f) above. Inventergy may also engage one or more personnel of GTX to act as a consultant
    in support of patent prosecution or monetization efforts, as further described below in Section 6.1; generally speaking, such
    services shall be provided upon request of Inventergy, for example, to answer questions of outside counsel relating to patent
    prosecution which cannot be answered by Inventergy, assist with patent monetization strategy and otherwise to assist monetization
    efforts by providing, for example, market information and analysis and/or information regarding purportedly infringing products.

4.3.2  
      Notwithstanding
    the previous section, approval of both Parties is required (a) for any sale or transfer of any of the Patents by the Entity,
    and/or (b) the granting of an exclusive license under any of the Patents by the Entity, and/or (c) any settlement which concedes
    invalidity of a Patent. Should the Parties be unable to agree on such approval, either Party shall be entitled to initiate
    a Dispute Resolution Process as provided below.   

4.4  
        Payment
    By Inventergy.   In consideration for the assignment of the Patents as provided above, Inventergy shall pay GTX as follows:   

GTX
shall be responsible for any taxes relating to the foregoing. Inventergy may request electronic transfer instructions so as to
effectuate  paperless  payment of the above amounts.

4.5  
        Nature
    Of Inventergy s Payment.   For avoidance of doubt, the Parties stipulate to the following:    

(a)
      
      The
    amounts represented in Section 4.4 shall be due and payable irrespective of whether any royalties are collected for licensing
    or assertion of any of the Patents; and   

(b)  
      The
    pertinent amounts stated in Section 4.4 up through the point of providing any Notice of Termination represent a walk away
    position (i.e., limit of liability) for Inventergy, subject to any Royalty Share owed to GTX for royalties actually collected
    which are attributable to any Substantially Completed Monetization Effort before Termination, and subject to the other provisions
    of the termination section, below.   

Example
    - Inventergy elects to terminate on July 5, 2016 and provides Notice of Termination on this date; in this event, Inventergy
    would be obligated to pay GTX $25,000 as provided above, and to cause the Entity to transfer the Patents back to GTX, but
    would not owe the other payments referenced above because it terminated on a date before such payments were due; if a licensing
    deal was signed prior to Termination, the Parties would continue to divide any Net Revenue whenever received for such Substantially
    Completed Monetization Effort according to the Parties  respective Revenue Shares.   

5.
 TERMINATION, MINIMUM QUARTERLY PAYMENTS, COMPUTATION OF REVENUE SHARES, AND LICENSE GOALS    

(a)
      
        By
    Inventergy:   Inventergy can terminate this Agreement upon fifteen (15) days  Notice at any time, with or without cause,
    but no earlier than 90 days after the Effective Date (if without cause).   

(b)
      
        By
    GTX:   GTX can terminate this Agreement only for cause, upon fifteen (15) days  Notice, (i) for failure to achieve License
    Goals (as provided below), or (ii) upon material breach by Inventergy, provided that GTX provides Inventergy with Notice of
    such breach and affords Inventergy fifteen (15) days  opportunity to cure prior to issuing Notice of Termination. In the event
    that GTX provides Notice of Termination, Inventergy shall be entitled during such fifteen (15) day Notice period to initiate
    the Dispute Resolution Process (see below) and any such Termination shall be stayed pending completion of the Dispute Resolution
    Process. This Agreement shall not be terminated unless such Process results in a finding that Termination is indeed justified
    according to the terms provided above.   

(c)
      
        Effect
    of Termination:   Subject to assignment to the Entity of the Patents as provided above, in the event of Termination,
    (i) Inventergy shall pay to GTX the amounts as specified in Section 4.4 above, to the extent such amounts have not already
    been paid, as owed up through the date that the Notice of Termination is provided; (ii) Inventergy shall pay to GTX its share
    of Net Revenue actually collected by the Entity (see the Net Revenue provisions, below), and (iii) Inventergy shall promptly
    cause the Entity to transfer and assign back to GTX or its designee all right, title and interest in each of the Patents,
    consistent with what was specified above in Section 4.1, including all (sole) responsibility for future prosecution and maintenance
    of the Patents following Termination, but not including right to receive royalties/damages for any Substantially Completed
    Monetization Effort. Following Termination, should additional royalties or other income be received by either Inventergy or
    GTX which is attributable to any Substantially Completed Monetization Effort, such additional amounts shall be treated as
    Patent Revenue (see below) by the Party receiving such Patent Revenue, with the receiving Party performing reimbursement as
    indicated below and paying out to the other Party its respective Revenue Share (although being offset against any previous
    advance paid according to the terms of Section 5.2 below); in other words, Termination shall not deprive a Party of a continuing
    right to its Revenue Share for transactions for Substantially Completed Monetization Efforts at the time of Termination, to
    the extent that associated Patent Revenues are received following Termination.

5.2  
        GTX
    Revenue Share Advance.   Inventergy agrees that, until it provides Notice of Termination, GTX will receive a cumulative
    Revenue Share amounting to not less than ***US per calendar year quarter, beginning January 1, 2017, with amounts being payable
    in the middle of the quarter (i.e., on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, respectively). To the extent that collected
    Patent Revenue does result in GTX receiving such a running Revenue Share, at a minimum, Inventergy shall provide an advance
    to GTX to make up the difference which will later be offset against Revenue Share which is paid to GTX. It is agreed that
    such advances are subject to a ***US cap. If GTX has already received Revenue Share which exceeds its cumulative guarantee,
    it shall not be due an advance. Once any combination of minimum advance or Revenue Share of ***US in the aggregate has been
    paid to GTX, there will be no obligation for further advances to be paid. Finally, in the event that either Party provides
    Notice of Termination, no additional quarterly advances will be due.   

Example
    1: The Entity receives ***US of Net Revenue in Q4CY2016, but receives no further Net Revenue until after CY2017. In such a
    case, GTX would be paid ***US as its Revenue Share on February 15, 2017, and would receive a ***US payment on May 15, 2017
    (representing the difference of 2 quarters* ***US, minus Revenue Share paid to date to GTX).   

Example
    2: Assume relative to Example 1 that the Entity further receives ***US additional Net Revenue on December 20, 2017 and receives
    no further Net Revenue during CY2018-2025; Inventergy would pay ***US to GTX on August 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017, and
    then on February 15, 2018, would pay ***US to GTX (GTX would have already received ***US in advances not yet offset against
    its Revenue Share, and so this would be deducted from its share of the ***US revenue). GTX in this example would not receive
    any more quarterly advances until January 15, 2022, when it would receive ***US as its last quarterly advance (i.e., at this
    point, it would have received cumulative ***US Revenue Share but would have an aggregate Revenue Share guarantee that becomes
    ***US on January 15, 2022). Because it would have effectively received ***US of Revenue Share at that point, no further quarterly
    advances would thereafter be payable.

Example
                                         3 - Entity receives an aggregate of ***US Patent Revenue during Q2 of CY2017, and there
                                         are outstanding, accrued reimbursement claims of ***US (including ***US fronted by Inventergy
                                         and ***US fronted by GTX), a minimum quarterly payment of ***US which was already paid
                                         to GTX during Q1CY2017 and another minimum quarterly payment which would ostensibly be
                                         due in Q2CY2017; in such a case, of the ***US Patent Revenue received by the Entity:    

a)
***would be reimbursed to Inventergy  

  b)
***would be reimbursed to GTX  

leaving
***US Net Revenue of which ***US would be due to GTX, but reduced by the ***prepayment to ***. If no further Patent Revenue was
received during the following four quarters, the minimum quarterly payments due to GTX over these next quarters would be ***US   ,
   ***US, ***US and ***US respectively.  

5.3  
        Calculation
    Of Revenue Shares.      

(a)
      
        Patent
    Revenue:   Revenue from licenses under the Patents, sales of one or more of the Patents, and/or other assertion of the
    Patents (including litigation), hereinafter  Patent Revenue,  received during the prior calendar year quarter will
    be handled as follows.   

(1)
      
      Patent
    Revenue shall first be applied to reimburse a Party that has paid for patent prosecution or monetization costs ( Costs ),
    including without limitation patent prosecution costs (e.g., filing fees, maintenance fees, outside counsel fees, etc.), fees
    for third party services (including GTX s Consulting Services, but only to extent that any fees or costs beyond the stock
    grant are paid), expert fees, outside counsel fees, etc.), and operating expenses of the Entity (e.g., marketing, payroll,
    taxes, etc.), substantially as follows   

Monies
    received during the previous calendar quarter will be accrued and used to reimburse Inventergy for Costs to the extent fronted
    pursuant to Section 4.3.1, above,   

Remaining
    monies will then be used to reimburse the Entity for Costs to the extent that such have been paid directly by the Entity,
    and   

Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, Cost reimbursement under this Section 5.3.(a)(2) as provided above shall be capped at fifty percent (50%) of
    Patent Revenue received for the previous calendar quarter, but any Costs above this amount are to be carried over and accrued
    from quarter-to-quarter; and   

(2)  
      Following
    allocation of Patent Revenue to reimbursement of Costs, remaining  Net Revenue  will then be paid out following
    close of the pertinent calendar quarter (e.g., on May 15 for Q1, August 15 for Q2, November 15 for Q3 and February 15 for
    Q4) to the Parties according to respective Revenue Share, deducting from GTX s share any previously paid quarterly advances
    to the extent not already offset against GTX s Revenue Share.

(3)
      
      The
    Revenue Share portion due to GTX will be distributed as follows:   

Within
2 weeks after Inventergy receives the Patent Revenue, Inventergy will provide GTX a notice of the receipt of funds and a statement
of Inventergy Costs.  

During
the following two weeks GTX will provide Inventergy the GTX Costs and GTX and Inventergy intend to come to an agreement on the
allocated Costs and resultant final allocation of funds   which will be transferred within 5 business days of agreement.  

If the parties cannot agree by the end of this two week period, then undisputed portions will be transferred within 5 business
day from that point.  

The disputed portion will be determined using the Dispute Resolution Process  

(b)
      
        Mixed
    Revenue:   Should income be received which is both attributable to (1) a license under the Patents, a sale of one or
    more of the Patents, or other monetization one or more of the Patents, and (2) a sale, license or other monetization of other
    intellectual property not contributed by GTX to the Entity pursuant to Section 4.1 above, then Parties will meet and agree
    to allocate a portion of such  Mixed Revenue  which is attributable to the Patents. If the Parties cannot agree
    upon allocation within thirty (30) days or the next calendar quarter end (whichever is longer), then either Party may initiate
    the Dispute Resolution Process (as provided below) in order to obtain an allocation of such Mixed Revenue to the Patents.   

c)  
       Finance:
     The Entity shall produce 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter an itemized report of the revenue received, the
    monetization expense allocations and the funds distributed. GTX may request with a 10 day notice an audit of the records for
    these reports, but no more often than twice a calendar year.. All expenses for the audit shall be covered by GTX unless there
    is a discrepancy of 5% or more at which point such audit expenses shall be added to the total of the remedies and shall be
    paid by Inventergy.    

5.4  
        License
    Goals.   The Parties anticipate that the Entity will generate Patent Revenues such that GTX is paid a cumulative Revenue
    Share (including minimum quarterly payments) of (1) ***US by [***], and (2) ***US by [***].

 CONSULTING SERVICES    

6.1  
      Concurrent
    with entry into this Agreement, GTX will execute the Consulting Agreement Attached hereto as Exhibit C to provide consulting
    services. GTX will, as specified in the Consulting Agreement, keep detailed written records of hours worked to the nearest
    quarter of an hour and should submit these to Inventergy in writing, with the expectation that GTX will provide twenty man-hours
    per month, on average, for eighteen months. The Parties acknowledge that this hours total represents an average, and there
    may be some months when significant more work is expected from GTX (e.g., 50 man hours) and other months where it is less.
    Should GTX s work exceed 25 man-hours in any given calendar month, GTX should alert Inventergy in writing as soon as possible.

6.2  
      Inventergy
    agrees to compensate GTX for the consulting services set forth above by transferring to GTX 42,500 shares of restricted common
    stock in Inventergy Global, Inc., with 1/6 th  of this stock vesting at the close of each calendar quarter (e.g.,
    October 1, January 1, etc.). GTX will be responsible for all taxes relative to this vesting and/or stock, and acknowledges
    that such stock or other rights or warrants may constitute restricted stock and may be subject to a holding period and/or
    withholding as provided by applicable law. This transfer will be the only compensation for the services to be provided under
    the Consulting Agreement, and GTX is to be solely responsible for all wage and hour issues associated with work performed
    by its personnel. As between Inventergy and GTX, all references to compensation in the Consulting Agreement shall be deemed
    to refer to such stock.   

6.3  
      In
    the event of Termination of the Consulting Agreement for material breach or otherwise according to its terms, GTX shall keep
    any previously vested stock in Inventergy Global, Inc.; if such Termination is effectuated by Inventergy without cause, vesting
    shall be accelerated for the remaining (unvested) portion of the 42,500 shares.   

6.4  
      At
    4-month intervals, the Parties will review the number of man-hours provided by GTX for consulting services, and shall discuss
    a revision to the compensation provided by Section 6.2 if the average man-hours per month provided by GTX since the start
    of providing consulting services exceeds 25.   

7.
 LICENSES    

7.1  
        Non-Exclusive
    License To GTX.   Subject to assignment of the Patents to the Entity as provided above, Inventergy shall cause the Entity
    to execute a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to make, use and sell products back to GTX, in the substantial form
    of Exhibit D.

    (30) days of the disclosure, or (3) of a nature where a reasonable person would have, under the circumstances, viewed the
    information in question as confidential or proprietary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will be considered  Confidential
    Information  to the extent such information (a) is already in the public domain, or becomes part of the public domain,
    through no fault of a Receiving Party or its personnel, (b) is rightfully received from a third party without any obligation
    of confidentiality or secrecy, or (c) is independently produced or developed by personnel of the Receiving Party having no

8.2  
        Obligations.
      A Receiving Party agrees that it will use reasonable measures to safeguard received Confidential Information against
    unauthorized disclosure or use, in no event less than those measures it uses for its own information of a like nature. Further,
    each Receiving Party agrees that it will not share Confidential Information with anyone other than its own employees, consultants
    and agents having a need to know such information consistent with the purposes of this Agreement, and who are obligated to
    protect Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure, to the full extent contemplated by this Agreement.
    A Receiving Party s obligations will endure for a period of three (3) years following Termination. A Receiving Party s breach
    of the aforementioned obligations will be excused to the limited extent that such was compelled by court or governmental order,
    provided that the Receiving Party informs the Disclosing Party of such order and affords the Disclosing Party (or entity)
    a reasonable opportunity to intervene, and provided that the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to obtain a protective
    order or other confidential treatment for the compelled information in absence of the Disclosing Party.   

8.3  
        Return
    of Information.   Immediately upon a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, and/or at Termination of this Agreement,
    the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and all copies
    or extracts thereof.

        Indemnification.
      GTX agrees that it will defend, indemnify and hold each of the Entity and Inventergy harmless against (a) any assertion
    that one or more of the Patents has an unlisted inventor, or that any royalty or other share of Patent Revenue is otherwise
    due or owed to any third party, or (b) any assertion that GTX does not have the power to transfer the Patents to the Entity.

11.1  
        Dispute
    Resolution Process.     In the event of a dispute hereunder, each Party agrees to use the following  Dispute
    Resolution Process.  The Dispute Resolution Process comprises a process where each Party will initially appoint a representative
    who will attempt to resolve the dispute; generally speaking, such representative are not necessarily limited to employees
    of the respective Parties, and it is generally anticipated that each Party may elect to appoint subject matter experts (e.g.,
    patent licensing experts) in order to resolve disputes between them.

June 16, 2016 ( Consultant ) and  Inventergy Innovations, LLC  ( Company ) agree as follows:  

1.  Services;
Payment; No Violation of Rights or Obligations . Consultant agrees to undertake and complete the Services (as defined in  Exhibit
A ) in accordance with and according to the schedule specified in  Appendix 1 . As the only consideration due Consultant
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, Company will pay Consultant in accordance with  Appendix 1 . Unless otherwise
specifically agreed upon by Company in writing (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement), all activity relating
to Services will be performed by and only by Consultant.   Consultant agrees that it will not (and will not permit others
to) violate any agreement with or rights of any third party or, except as expressly authorized by Company in writing hereafter,
use or disclose at any time Consultant s own or any third party s confidential information or intellectual property
in connection with the Services or otherwise for or on behalf of Company.  

2.  Ownership;
Rights; Proprietary Information; Publicity .  

a. Company
shall own all right, title and interest (including patent rights, copyrights, trade secret rights, mask work rights, trademark
rights,  sui generis    database rights and all other intellectual and industrial property rights of any sort throughout
the world) relating to any and all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, mask works, designations, designs,
know-how, ideas and information made or conceived or reduced to practice, in whole or in part, by or for or on behalf of Consultant
during the term of this Agreement that relate to the subject matter of, or arise out of, or in connection with, the Services 
 or any Proprietary Information (as defined below) (collectively,  Inventions ) and Consultant will promptly disclose
and provide all Inventions to Company. Consultant hereby makes all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership;
provided that no assignment is made that extends beyond what would be allowed under California Labor Code Section 2870 (attached
as  Exhibit B ) if Consultant was an employee of Company. Consultant shall further assist Company, at Company s expense,
to further evidence, record and perfect such assignments, and to perfect, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend any rights assigned.
Consultant hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Company as its agents and attorneys-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to
act for and on Consultant s behalf to execute and file any document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further

b. Consultant
agrees that all Inventions and all other business, technical and financial information that Consultant develops, or learns, or
obtains during the period over which Consultant is to be providing the Services that relate to Company or the business or demonstrably
anticipated business of Company or in connection with the Services or that are received by or for Company in confidence, constitute
 Proprietary Information  of Company. For avoidance of doubt, Proprietary Information includes without limitation
all information relating the identity of and information relating to Company s vendors, customers and employees, all non-public
information relating to Company, or to Company s products and technology, and all non-public information relating to any work
product prepared by Consultant under this Agreement. Consultant will on a perpetual basis hold in confidence and not disclose
Proprietary Information or use for Consultant s benefit or for the benefit of any third party. Consultant s obligation of non-use
and non-disclosure, however, will not extend to information that Consultant can prove (by competent documentary evidence) has
become publicly available without restriction through no fault of Consultant. In the event of any breach or threatened breach
of the protection obligations stated herein, irreparable harm shall be presumed and Company shall be entitled to seek an injunction
and/or seek specific performance without waiving any other remedies available at law or equity. Upon termination and as otherwise
requested by Company, Consultant will promptly return to Company all items and copies containing or embodying Proprietary Information,
except that Consultant may keep its personal copies of its compensation records and this Agreement. Consultant also recognizes
and agrees that Consultant has no expectation of privacy or other right with respect to telecommunications sent using Company s
infrastructure, or to the networking or information processing systems of Company, and that such are to be used exclusively for
Company business; this includes, without limitation, stored computer files, email messages and voice messages, created, sent or
stored on Company systems. Consultant s activity, and any files or messages, on or using any of those systems may be monitored
at any time without notice and/or may be suspended or deactivated at any time, without notice. Company hereby provides notice,
however, that the provisions set forth in this section do not abrogate the immunity set forth in Section 1833 of title 18, United
States Code, relating to disclosure of a trade secret to an attorney or court in connection with specified actions.  

c. Consultant
agrees that notwithstanding any rights of publicity, privacy or otherwise (whether or not statutory) anywhere in the world and
without any further compensation, Company may and is hereby authorized to use Consultant s name in connection with promotion
of its business, products and services and to allow others to do so. To the extent any of the foregoing is ineffective under applicable
law, Consultant hereby provides any and all ratifications and consents necessary to accomplish the purposes of the foregoing to
the extent possible. Consultant will confirm any such ratifications and consents from time to time as requested by Company. If
any other person provides any Services or provides services similar to any of those referred to above in this paragraph in connection
with the Services, Consultant will obtain the foregoing ratifications, consents and authorizations from such person for Company s
exclusive benefit.  

d. If
any part of the Services or Inventions or information provided hereunder is based on, incorporates, or is an improvement or derivative
of, or cannot be reasonably and fully made, used, reproduced, distributed and otherwise exploited without using or violating technology
or intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to Consultant (or any person involved in the Services)   and not assigned
hereunder, Consultant hereby grants Company and its successors a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable right and license to exploit and exercise all such technology and intellectual property rights in support of Company s
exercise or exploitation of the Services, Inventions, other work or information performed or provided hereunder, or any assigned
rights (including any modifications, improvements and derivatives of any of them).  

f. For
avoidance of doubt, Consultant may as a general perform services for other persons, provided that such services do not (i) represent
a conflict of interest or divided loyalty for Consultant s obligations under this agreement, (ii) detract from Consultant s obligation
to provide services under this Agreement, (iii) use or disclose any of Company s Proprietary Information, directly or otherwise,
or otherwise breach any provision of this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise violate the intellectual property or other rights of Company.

3.  Warranties

and workmanlike manner and that none of such Services nor any part of this Agreement is or will be inconsistent with any obligation
Consultant may have to others; (ii) all work under this Agreement shall be Consultant s original work and none of the Services

4.  Termination .
If either party breaches a material provision of this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon 10 days 
notice, unless the breach is cured within the notice period. Company also may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without
cause, upon 30 days  notice, but, if (and only if) such termination is without cause, Company shall upon such termination
pay Consultant all unpaid, undisputed   amounts due for the Services completed prior to notice of such termination. Sections
2 (including without limitation the obligation to preserve Company s Proprietary Information against non-use and disclosure) through
8 of this Agreement and any remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration.  

5.  Relationship
of the Parties; Independent Contractor; No Employee Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision hereof, Consultant is an independent
contractor (not an employee or other agent) solely responsible for the manner and hours in which the Services are performed, is
solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings and other statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations of any sort (including,
but not limited to, those relating to workers  compensation, disability insurance, Social Security, unemployment compensation
coverage, the Fair Labor Standards Act, income taxes, etc.), and is not entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans,
fringe benefit programs, group insurance arrangements or similar programs. Consultant agrees to indemnify Company from any and
all claims, damages, liability, settlement, attorneys  fees and expenses, as incurred, on account of the foregoing or any
breach of this Agreement or any other action or inaction by or for or on behalf of Consultant. If Consultant is a corporation,
it will ensure that its employees and agents are bound in writing to Consultant s obligations under this Agreement.  

6.  Assignment .
This Agreement and the services contemplated hereunder are personal to Consultant and Consultant shall not have the right or ability
to assign, transfer, or subcontract any obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of Company. Any attempt to
do so shall be void. Company may freely assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this agreement in whole or part.  

7.  Notice .
All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when personally delivered, or three days after
being sent by prepaid certified or registered U.S. mail to the address of the party to be noticed as set forth herein or to such
other address as such party last provided to the other by written notice.

8.  Miscellaneous .
Any breach of Section 2 or 3 will cause irreparable harm to Company for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore,
Company will be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies. The failure of either party
to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes
or modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. In the event that
any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated
to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws
provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled
to recover costs and attorneys  fees. Headings herein are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way affect interpretation
of the Agreement. This Agreement integrates and supersedes any prior and/or contemporaneous agreements and/or discussions between
the parties. This Agreement incorporates the provisions of Appendix 1, but in the event of conflict between Appendix 1 and the
terms already set forth in this Agreement, the terms already set forth in this Agreement shall prevail.  

9.  Arbitration .
Any controversy or claim (except those regarding Inventions, Proprietary Information or intellectual property) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof, provided however, that each party will have a right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
in a court of law. The prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the nonprevailing party all costs, damages and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred by the prevailing party in connection with that action or proceeding, whether
or not the controversy is reduced to judgment or award. The prevailing party will be that party who may be fairly said by the
arbitrator(s) to have prevailed on the major disputed issues. Consultant hereby consents to the arbitration in the State of California
in the county of Santa Clara.

   LICENSE
AGREEMENT   

This license agreement ( License Agreement ) is entered into effective July 1, 2016 ( Effective Date ) by
and between Inventergy LBS, LLC with a place of business at 900 E. Hamilton Avenue, Suite 180, Campbell, CA 95008 ( Entity ),
and Global Trek Xploration, a California Corporation with a place of business at 117 W. 9TH Street, Suite 1214, Los Angeles, California
90015 ( GTX ); each of these entities is to be considered a  Party  to this License Agreement.  

WHEREAS,
GTX has transferred certain patents and patent applications ( Patents ) to the Entity, and wherein Entity, in partial
consideration for such transference has agreed to provide a non-exclusive, limited license under the Patents back to GTX, NOW,
THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows.  

For
good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Entity hereby grants to GTX a personal, nonexclusive,
nontransferable, irrevocable, worldwide license under the Patents to make, use, have made for resale by GTX, to sell, offer for
sale, import and otherwise dispose of  Licensed Products.  As used herein,  Licensed Products  means products
that are any of (1) internally used by GTX, (2) sold under GTX s name which, absent a license, would infringe one or more of the
Patents, or (3) those made by GTX (OEM products of GTX where all aspects of manufacture and design are controlled by GTX) (includes
manufacture on behalf of GTX) but shipped under a third party label. No other, further or different license is hereby granted
or implied, and GTX shall have no right to grant sublicenses to the Patents to any entity, nor to exclude others from practice
of any invention claimed by any of the Patents. Entity and GTX intend for this license to be limited to the Patents transferred
by GTX to Entity, and GTX expressly acknowledges that it is not being granted and has not bargained for any rights, implied or
otherwise, to any other patents or intellectual property, including without limitation, any patents or other intellectual property
owned or controlled by Inventergy, now or in the future, under any legal or equitable theory, including patent exhaustion. For
clarity, GTX s sale of Licensed Products shall not convey to GTX s customers any right or license (express or implied or under
other legal doctrine, such as patent exhaustion) under any claim of any Patent where such claim is not directly infringed by the
Licensed Product as sold or transferred by GTX.  

In
the event GTX acquires 100% of another business entity, a third party line of business or substantially all of the assets of a
third party line of business, that is, in each case, related to the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, importation and/or
disposition of products that are substantially similar to and/or related to the Licensed Products, and which would also infringe
one or more of the Patents absent a license, (collectively,  Acquired Products ), such Acquired Products shall be considered

    directly or indirectly, immediately following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, greater than at least percent
    50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation

In
the event GTX divests a line of business or substantially all of the assets of a GTX line of business to a third party, GTX shall
have the option to a) have such divested line of business cease to enjoy the benefits of this License Agreement on the effective
date of such a divestment, and, therefore, any activity of the divested line of business occurring on or after the effective date
of such a divestment will not be licensed nor entitled to any of the benefits of this License Agreement; or b) assign the license
subject to all of the terms of this License Agreement with the divested line of business to such third party, and therefore not
retain any license as to GTX s own line of business or products, HOWEVER, with respect to any such assignment, the total aggregate
sales revenue of the divested line of business after the divestiture will only be licensed up to an amount equal to 120% of GTX s
sales of Licensed Products in the divested line of business in the last preceding full year in which Licensed Products in the
divested line of business were sold. Should the divested line of business wish to make, use or sell additional volumes of Licensed
Product, such shall be licensable from the Entity subject to execution of a license agreement with the Entity which provides for
royalty or other license fees and obligations for volume in excess of the 120% metric, with terms similar to those generally agreed
to by other licensees of the Patents.  

GTX
understands and acknowledges that the covenants and licenses granted in this License Agreement are intended to cover only products
of GTX and are not intended to and do not cover manufacturing activities that GTX may undertake on behalf of third parties. Accordingly,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this License Agreement and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
no licenses are granted or otherwise provided GTX to manufacture or have manufactured products as a foundry or contract manufacturer
for a third party or to distribute such products to such third party or to customers of such third party.  

GTX
will not take steps or actions to challenge or impair the validity or enforceability or rights associated with any of the Patents.  

The
Entity makes no representations regarding ability to practice any invention or technology under the Patents. Without limiting
the foregoing, Entity disclaims any representation or warranty that any technology may be made, used or sold under the Patents
either in a manner that is safe, or in a manner that is free from claims of third parties. Any actions or omissions of GTX, whether
or not associated with the Patents, are to be at GTX s sole risk and exposure.
