    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)  

1.          Nature
of Business and Basis of Presentation  

Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc.
and subsidiaries ( we,  the  Company  or  ARCA ) are in the business of providing turnkey appliance
recycling and replacement services for electric utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs. We also sell new major
household appliances through a chain of Company-owned stores under the name ApplianceSmart   . In addition, we have
a 50% interest in a joint venture operating under the name ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC ( AAP ). 

The accompanying balance sheet as of
January 2, 2016, which has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) in the United States of America for interim financial information and Article 8 of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, normal and
recurring adjustments and accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation for the periods indicated have been included.
Operating results for the three month and nine month periods ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, are
presented using 13-week and 39-week periods, respectively. The results of operations for any interim period are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the year. 

In preparation of the Company s financial
statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
related revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision,
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended January 2,
2016, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 4, 2016. 

Principles of consolidation :  
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

ApplianceSmart, Inc., a Minnesota corporation,
is a wholly owned subsidiary that was formed through a corporate reorganization in July 2011 to hold our business of selling
new major household appliances through a chain of Company-owned retail stores. ARCA Canada Inc., a Canadian corporation, is a wholly
owned subsidiary that was formed in September 2006 to provide turnkey recycling services for electric utility energy efficiency
programs. ARCA Recycling, Inc., a California corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in November 1991
to provide turnkey recycling services for electric utility energy efficiency programs. The operating results of our wholly owned
subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. 

AAP is a joint venture that was formed in
October 2009 between ARCA and 4301 Operations, LLC ( 4301 ) to employ advanced technology to refine traditional
appliance recycling techniques to achieve optimal revenue-generating and environmental benefits. ARCA and 4301 have a 50% interest
in AAP. The financial position and results of operations of AAP are consolidated in our financial statements based on our
conclusion that AAP is a variable interest entity due to our contribution in excess of 50% of the total equity, subordinated debt
and other forms of financial support. We have a controlling financial interest in AAP  and  have provided substantial financial
support to fund the operations of AAP since its inception. 

2.          Inventories  

The Company's inventories primarily consist
of appliances, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a specific identification basis, or market. Process metals include
ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metals, and are valued at the lower of average purchased cost or market based on the specific scrap
commodity. 

We provide estimated provisions for the obsolescence
of our appliance inventories, including adjustments to market, based on various factors, including the age of such inventory and
our management s assessment of the need for such provisions. We look at historical inventory aging and margin analysis in
determining our provision estimate. A revised cost basis is used once a provision for obsolescence is recorded. 

3.          Earnings
per Share  

Basic income per common share is computed based
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per common share is computed based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the
potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive shares of Common Stock include unexercised stock options and
warrants. Basic per share amounts are computed, generally, by dividing net income attributable to controlling interest by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance
of all potential Common Stock instruments unless their effect is anti-dilutive, thereby reducing the loss or increasing the income
per common share. In calculating diluted weighted average shares and per share amounts, we included stock options and warrants
with exercise prices below average market prices, for the respective reporting periods in which they were dilutive, using the treasury
stock method. We calculated the number of additional shares by assuming the outstanding stock options were exercised and that the
proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire Common Stock at the average market price during the quarter. For the three months
and nine months ended October 1, 2016, we excluded options and warrants to purchase 641 and 743 shares of common stock from the
diluted weighted average share outstanding calculation as the effect of these options and warrants were anti-dilutive. For the
three months and nine months ended October 3, 2015, we excluded options and warrants to purchase 789 and 750 shares of common stock
from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation as the effect of these options and warrants were anti-dilutive. 

4.          Share-Based
Compensation  

We recognized share-based compensation expense
 of $123 and $217 for the three months ended October 1, 2016, and October 3, 2015, respectively and $264 and $265
for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively. 

Based on the value of options outstanding as
of October 1, 2016, estimated future share-based compensation expense (benefit) is as follows: 

The estimate above does not include any expense
for additional options that may be granted and vest during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. 

5.          Product
Warranty  

We provide a warranty for the replacement or
repair of certain defective units, which varies based on the product sold.  Our standard warranty policy requires us to repair
or replace certain defective units at no cost to our customers. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranty and
record an accrual in the amount of such costs at the time we recognize product revenue. Factors that affect our warranty
accrual for covered units include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on these units,
and the cost of such claims. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty accrual and adjust the amounts
as necessary. 

Changes in our warranty accrual are as follows: 

6.          Variable
Interest Entity  

The financial position and results of operations
of AAP are consolidated in our financial statements based on our conclusion that AAP is a variable interest entity due to our
contribution in excess of 50% of the total equity, subordinated debt and other forms of financial support. We have a controlling
financial interest in AAP and  have provided substantial financial support to fund the operations of AAP since its inception.
The financial position and results of operations for AAP are reported in our recycling segment. 

The following table summarizes the assets and
liabilities of AAP as of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016: 

(b)    Other liabilities represent loans and advances between ARCA and AAP that are eliminated
in consolidation. 

In April 2016, an officer of the Company loaned
$75 to AAP through the issuance of an 8% promissory note. In August 2016, the note was repaid with the collection of carbon offset
program revenues. 

The following table summarizes the operating
results of AAP for the three months and nine months ended July 2, 2016, and October 3, 2015: 

7.          Other
Assets  

Other assets as of October 1, 2016, and
January 2, 2016, consist of the following: 

For the three months ended October 1, 2016,
and October 3, 2015, we recorded amortization expense of $0 and $20, respectively, related to our recycling contract. For
the nine months ended October 1, 2016, and October 3, 2015, we recorded amortization expense of $20 and $60, respectively,
related to our recycling contract.  

8.          Accrued
Expenses  

Accrued expenses as of October 1, 2016,
and January 2, 2016, consist of the following: 

9.          Line
of Credit  

We have a Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security
Agreement, as amended, ( Revolving Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC ) that
provides us with a $15,000 revolving line of credit. See Note 10 for further discussion regarding the Term Loan entered into
with PNC. The Revolving Credit Agreement had a stated maturity date of January 24, 2016, and was renewed on January 22, 2016.
Our financial covenants were reset in connection with this renewal. 

The renewed Revolving Credit Agreement
has a stated maturity of January 31, 2017 and is recorded as a current liability.. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a lockbox
agreement, a subjective acceleration clause and is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. PNC
is also secured by an inventory repurchase agreement with Whirlpool Corporation for Whirlpool purchases only in which we issued
a $750 letter of credit in favor of Whirlpool Corporation. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires, starting with the fiscal quarter
ending April 2, 2016, that we meet a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and continuing at
the end of each quarter thereafter, that we meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0. The Revolving Credit Agreement
limits investments we can purchase, the amount of other debt and leases we can incur, the amount of loans we can issue to our
affiliates and the amount we can spend on fixed assets, along with prohibiting the payment of dividends. In the January 22, 2016
renewal, the affiliate loan balance is capped at $1,000 on December 31, 2015, and thereafter. As of October 1, 2016, we were in
compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant; however, PNC notified us that we exceeded the affiliate loan limitations,
and we have disputed such notice. As of January 2, 2016, we were not in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving
Credit Agreement which were subsequently waived with the January 22, 2016 renewal. 

The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Agreement,
in our renewal agreement on January 22, 2016, is PNC Base Rate plus 1.75% to 3.25%, or 1-, 2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR Rate plus 2.75%
to 4.25%, with the rate being dependent on our level of fixed charge coverage. The PNC Base Rate shall mean, for any day, a fluctuating
per annum rate of interest equal to the highest of (i) the interest rate per annum announced from time to time by PNC as its
prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Open Rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points (1%).
As of October 1, 2016, the outstanding line of credit balance was $9,809 with a weighted average interest rate of 8.75%, which
was the PNC Base Rate plus a default premium. As of January 2, 2016, the outstanding line of credit balance was $12,668 with
a weighted average interest rate of 7.25%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default premium. 

The amount of revolving borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement is based on a formula using accounts receivable and inventories. We may not have access to the
full $15,000 revolving line of credit due to the formula using accounts receivable and inventories, the amount of the letter of
credit issued in favor of Whirlpool Corporation and the amount of outstanding loans between PNC and our AAP joint venture.
As of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, our available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement was
$3,097 and $1,382, respectively. 

10.          Borrowings  

Long-term debt, capital lease and other financing
obligations as of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, consist of the following: 

On January 24, 2011, we entered into a
$2,550 Term Loan ( Term Loan ) with PNC Bank to refinance the mortgage on our California facility. The Term Loan
is payable as follows, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination of the Revolving Credit
Agreement: 119 consecutive monthly principal payments of $21 plus interest commencing on February 1, 2011, and continuing
on the first day of each month thereafter followed by a 120th payment of all unpaid principal, interest and fees on February 1,
2021. If the Revolving Credit Agreement is not renewed, a balloon payment of $1,020 in principal plus interest and additional fees
will be due on January 31, 2017. The Term Loan is collateralized with our California facility located in Compton, California. The
Term Loan interest rate is PNC Base Rate plus 2.25% to 3.75%, or 1-, 2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR Rate plus 3.25% to 4.75%, with the
rate being dependent on our level of fixed charge coverage. 

The interest rate will be fixed for the first
half of 2016 at PNC Base Rate plus 3.75%, or 1-,2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR Rate plus 4.75%. As of October 1, 2016, the weighted average
interest rate was 9.25%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default rate premium. As of January 2, 2016, the weighted average
interest rate was 7.75%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default rate premium. As of October 1, 2016, the balance due on the
Term Loan is classified as current as the maturity of our credit facility is January 31, 2017. 

On March 10, 2011, AAP entered into
three separate commercial term loans ( Term Loans ) with Susquehanna Bank, pursuant to the guidelines of the U.S.
Small Business Administration 7(a) Loan Program.  The total amount of the Term Loans is $4,750, split into three separate
loans for $2,100; $1,400; and $1,250. The Term Loans mature on March 10, 2021 and bear an interest rate of Prime plus 2.75%. As
of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, the interest rate was 6.00%. Borrowings under the Term Loans are secured by
substantially all of the assets of AAP along with liens on the business assets and certain personal assets of the owners of 4301
Operations, LLC. We are a guarantor of the Term Loans along with 4301 Operations, LLC and its owners. In connection with these
Term Loans, Susquehanna Bank also has a security interest in the assets of the Company. 

In March of 2015, an entity controlled by one
of the noncontrolling interest holders of AAP loaned AAP $325 through the issuance of promissory notes. The notes bear interest
at an annual rate of 8%. In May of 2015, one of the March 2015 notes totaling $125 was repaid in full by AAP. In February 2016,
an entity controlled by one of the noncontrolling interest holders of AAP loaned AAP $100 through the issuance of an 8% promissory
note. In August 2016, the remaining notes totaling $300 were repaid with the collection of carbon offset program revenues. 

For the three months ended October 1,
2016, and October 3, 2015, we recorded non-cash interest expense of $50 and $27, respectively, related to debt issuance costs.
For the nine months ended October 1, 2016, and October 3, 2015, we recorded non-cash interest expense of $142 and $81, respectively,
related to debt issuance costs. 

Capital leases and other financing obligations :  
We acquire certain equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. The cost of the equipment was $2,607 and
$2,667 as of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, respectively. Accumulated amortization as of October 1,
2016, and January 2, 2016, was approximately $1,748 and $1,635, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense
is included in cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

11.          Commitments
and Contingencies  

Contracts :   We have entered
into material contracts with three appliance manufacturers. Under the agreements there are no minimum purchase commitments; however,
we have agreed to indemnify the manufacturers for certain claims, allegations or losses with respect to appliances we sell. 

Litigation :    
On March 6, 2015, a complaint was filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California by Jason
Feola, individually and as a representative of a putative class consisting of purchasers of the Company s common stock
between March 15, 2012 and February 11, 2015, against Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and certain current and
former officers of the Company. Mr. Feola, pursuant to terms of his retainer agreement with The Rosen Law Firm,
certified that he purchased 240 shares of the Company s common stock for approximately $1 in total consideration. On
May 7, 2015, the Company and the individual defendants were served the complaint. In July 2015, the Company and the
individual defendants received an amended complaint. The complaint alleges that misstatements and omissions occurred in press
releases and filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that these misstatements or omissions
constitute violations of Section 20 (a) and Section 10(b) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In October 2015, the court held a hearing on the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint. On November 24, 2015, the
United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an order granting the motion to dismiss the
amended complaint. The Court s order provided that the dismissal was without prejudice and that the plaintiffs may file
an amended complaint within 21 days of the issuance of the order. On December 15, 2015, the Company and the individual
defendants were served with a second amended complaint. In May 2016, the court held a hearing on the Company's motion to
dismiss the second amended complaint. On October 21, 2016 the court entered a final judgment to dismiss the class action
complaint with prejudice and the plaintiff has 30 days to appeal the dismissal. 

On November 6, 2015, a complaint was filed
in the Minnesota District Court for Hennepin County, Minnesota, by David Gray and Michael Boller, purporting to bring suit derivatively
and on behalf of the Company against twelve current and former officers and directors of the Company. The complaint alleges that
the defendants breached their fiduciary duties based on substantially similar allegations to those asserted in Mr. Feola's putative
securities class action complaint, and that the defendants have been unjustly enriched as a result thereof. The complaint seeks
damages, disgorgement, an award of attorneys  fees and other expenses, and an order compelling changes to the Company s
corporate governance and internal procedures. This matter has been stayed by the court, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,
until the United States District Court for the Central District of California determines the legal sufficiency of Mr. Feola's
complaint or other specified developments occur in that case. 

In February 2012, various individuals
commenced a class action lawsuit against Whirlpool Corporation ( Whirlpool ) and various distributors of Whirlpool
products, including Sears, The Home Depot, Lowe s and us, alleging certain appliances Whirlpool sold through its distribution
chain, which includes us, were improperly designated with the ENERGY STAR    qualification rating established by
the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. The claims against us include breach of warranty claims,
as well as various state consumer protection claims. The class action settlement was preliminarily approved in June 2016 and members
have until March 2017 to opt out of the class or object to the settlement. Whirlpool has offered to fully indemnify and defend
its distributors in this lawsuit. We are monitoring Whirlpool s defense of the claims and believe the possibility of a material
loss is remote. 

AMTIM Capital, Inc. ( AMTIM ) acts as our representative
to market our recycling services in Canada under an arrangement that pays AMTIM for revenues generated by recycling services in
Canada as set forth in the agreements between the parties.  A dispute has arisen between AMTIM and us with respect to the
calculation of amounts due to AMTIM pursuant to the agreement. In a lawsuit filed in the province of Ontario, AMTIM claims
a discrepancy in the calculation of fees due to AMTIM by us of approximately $2,000. Although the outcome of this claim is
uncertain, we believe that no further amounts are due under the terms of the agreement and will continue to defend our position
relative to this lawsuit. 

We are party from time to time to ordinary
course disputes that we do not believe to be material or have merit. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these
ordinary course disputes. 

Sales and Use Taxes:   We operate
in twenty-three states in the U.S. and in various provinces in Canada. From time to time, we are subject to sales and use tax audits
that could result in additional taxes, penalties and interest owed to various taxing authorities. 

The California Board
of Equalization ( BOE ) is conducting a sales and use tax examination covering the California operations of Appliance
Recycling Centers of America, Inc. (the  Company ) for 2011, 2012 and 2013. The Company believed it was exempt from
collecting sales taxes under service agreements with utility customers that included appliance replacement programs. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the Company received communication from the BOE indicating they are not in agreement with the Company s
interpretation of the law. As a result, the Company applied for and, as of February 9, 2015, received approval to participate in
the California Board of Equalization s Managed Audit Program. The period covered under this program includes 2011, 2012,
2013 and extends through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. At this time, our best estimate of the amount that will
be assessed by the BOE covering all periods under audit is approximately $4.2 million in sales tax and interest related to the
appliance replacement programs that we administered on behalf of our customers on which we did not assess, collect or remit sales
tax. The Company has been working with outside consultants to arrive at our assessment estimate and will continue to engage the
services of these sales tax experts throughout the Managed Audit Program process. The sales tax amounts that we will likely be
assessed relate to transactions in the period under examination by the BOE. Such assessment, however, will be subject to protest
and appeal, and would not need to be funded until the matter has been fully resolved. Resolution could take up to two years. 

12.          Income
Taxes  

For the three months ended October 1, 2016
and October 3, 2015, we did not record a provision for income taxes and recorded a benefit of income taxes of $308, respectively.
For the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $438 and recorded a
benefit of income taxes of $894, respectively. 

Our overall effective tax rate, based on
projected full-year taxable income, was 0% and 22.5% for the three months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively.
Our overall effective tax rate, based on projected full-year taxable income (loss), was (44.2)% and 25.9% for the nine months ended
October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 34% due
primarily to the impact of lower foreign tax rates, state taxes, share-based compensation and the book income (loss) of consolidated
AAP attributable to noncontrolling interest. 

We regularly evaluate both positive and
negative evidence related to retaining a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the periods when deductible temporary differences and carryforwards
are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. We have concluded based on the weight of negative evidence that a valuation
allowance should be maintained against certain deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize as of October 1, 2016. 

13.          Segment
Information  

We operate within targeted markets through
two reportable segments: retail and recycling. The retail segment is comprised of income generated through our ApplianceSmart stores,
which includes appliance sales and byproduct revenues from collected appliances. The recycling segment includes all fees charged
and costs incurred for collecting, recycling and installing appliances for utilities and other customers and includes byproduct
revenue, which is primarily generated through the recycling of appliances. We have included the results from consolidating AAP
in our recycling segment. The nature of products, services and customers for both segments varies significantly. As such, the segments
are managed separately. Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ).
The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on revenues and income from operations of each segment.  Income
from operations represents revenues less cost of revenues and operating expenses, including certain allocated selling, general
and administrative costs. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers. 

The following tables present our segment information
for periods indicated: 

14.          Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective  

In May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard
on revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting
revenue. The new standard is effective for us in fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either a retrospective or a cumulative
effect transition method. We are currently assessing the impact of implementing the new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a standard requiring an entity s management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements. The
guidance also sets forth a series of disclosures that are required in the event the entity s management concludes that there
is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard becomes effective for us
in the annual financial statements for fiscal 2016 and requires an ongoing evaluation at each interim and annual period thereafter.
We are currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued a standard
that primarily requires organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing
the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory
(Topic 330) Related to Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory which  applies to all inventory except that which is measured
using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. Inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average
cost is included in the new amendments. Inventory within the scope of the new guidance should be measured at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using
LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments will take effect for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
Dec. 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance should be applied prospectively, and earlier
application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are evaluating the impact of the standard
on the consolidated financial statements. 

15.          Subsequent
Event  

On November 8, 2016, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement with Energy Efficiency Investments, LLC, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue
up to $7,732 principal amount of 3% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company and related
common stock purchase warrants. The notes will be issued from time to time, up to such aggregate principal amount, at the
request of the Company, subject to certain conditions, or at the option of the Investor. Interest accrues at the rate of
eight percent per annum on the principal amount of the notes outstanding from time to time, and is payable at maturity or, if
earlier, upon conversion of the notes. The principal amount of notes outstanding at November 8, 2016, was $103. On November
10, 2016, we advanced to an officer of the company $75 for a short term note.

Overview and Recent Trends  

Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc.
and Subsidiaries ( we,  the  Company  or  ARCA ) serve as the bridge from utilities and appliance
manufacturers to the end customers by recycling, replacing, and selling major household appliances in North America. We are committed
to energy efficiency programs and have been a pioneer in appliance recycling programs. We have three revenue streams: 

Retail    

Recycling    

By-Product    

Our retail group generates income from
the sale of appliances and related services through 18 ApplianceSmart    stores in four geographic areas. We have
an online presence and sell directly to real estate developers. We specialize in appliance sales with experienced staff that are
acquainted with the various brands, trends and features of our products. Our key differentiator is we provide manufacturers a channel
to move their out-of-the-box products, also known as  ding and dent  or factory seconds, affordably without disrupting
their normal distribution channels. For this service for we are granted access to significant purchase discounts on new products
equivalent to the large big box retailers. 

In the United States 60 million appliances
which is equivalent to 17 billion dollars are sold annually. We serve less than 1% of the market and have room to grow in all
of our geographic areas. A significant trend, in the appliance marketplace, is margin compression due to price competition among
the major big box retailers. Our regional approach by focusing on one metropolitan area gives us an opportunity to brand ourselves
locally and optimize our advertising expenditures. We believe our regional approach enables us to compete effectively with all
competitors. We have an opportunity to gain market share as we are currently planning on expanding and opening new stores within
the next year as our time to open a store is one of the fastest in the industry. 

Our recycling programs includes all income
generated from collecting, recycling and installing appliances for utilities and other customers. We have two major initiatives
in this group: 1) collecting which is picking up used appliances and 2) replacement which is bringing the customer a new energy
efficient product in exchange for their old product. We have over a 20 year history in both programs and our ability to purchase
products at a significant discount gives us a unique advantage in the replacement programs; however, in the past few years we
have seen a significant decline in the replacement business as utility companies are not realizing the energy efficient savings
they once did with the older units. Furthermore, in the past year we have added several collecting programs due to the receivership
of our largest competitor. The competitor reportly had contracts with 180 utilities and during the nine months ended October 1,
2015 we have added 31 new customers and continue to pursue the acquisition of the remaining contracts. In 2016, we have significantly
invested in people, equipment and process improvement initiatives. This investment was for the most part expensed and has driven
down our near-term profitability. We expect it will benefit us in the longer term. 

The By-Product revenue is generated through
the sale of materials obtained from de-manufacturing of appliances. We have established 17 Regional Processing Centers ( RPCs )
which we break down the units and sell the by- products such as scrap, metallic products and refrigerants. The RPC in Philadelphia
is operated by ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC ( AAP ) through a joint venture agreement between ARCA and 4301 Operations,
LLC ( 4301 ). AAP which employs advanced technology to refine traditional appliance recycling techniques to achieve
optimal revenue-generating and environmental benefits. AAP is also the exclusive North American distributor for UNTHA Recycling
Technology ( URT ), one of the world s leading manufacturers of technologically advanced refrigerator recycling
systems and recycling facilities for electrical household appliances. The decline in commodity prices over the past two years
has adversely affected the operations of AAP and required us to provide additional financial support to AAP. We are pursuing
options to turn AAP around financially. 

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  

For the three months ended October 1,
2016 net sales declined 2.7% or $0.7 million compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015. The decrease was due to several
factors. The largest decrease came from our replacement programs which were down $3.4 million due to ended or delayed contracts
in 2016. This was offset by a gain of $2.3 million collected units under our new recycle programs. The number of customers invoiced
in our recycling programs for the quarter ended October 1, 2016 was 48 compared to 21 in the three months ended October 3, 2015.
Our By-Product revenue increased as we recorded a $1.5 million payment from the sale of carbon offset credits. 

For the nine months ended October 1, 2016
net sales declined 9.8% or $8.3 million compared to the nine months ended October 3, 2015. This was due to several factors. Retail
sales declined $3.0 million for the nine month ended October 1, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to price competition
among major big box retailers. Our average selling price per unit was $613 for nine months ended October 1, 2016 in comparison
to $620 for the same period in 2015. We are working to find additional value added products to increase our per ticket sale. 

Revenue from appliance replacement programs
were down $8.4 million due to the ending or delay of some contracts which was offset by a $3.6 million increase in revenue from
new collecting programs. 

Our By-Product revenue for the year was
lower primarily due to the decline of commodity prices of $1.0 million offset by an increase of $0.5 carbon offsets credits payments
in the nine months ended October 1, 2016 compared to the nine months ended October 3, 2015. 

Gross Profit  

Gross Profit is impacted by the following for
the three and for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015: 

The product and service mix of retail products and programs.    

The prices at which we purchase product from the major appliance manufacturers
and retailers that supply product to us.    

The prices at which we can purchase recyclable appliances for processing
at our RPCs.    

The volume of appliances we receive through our utility company energy
efficiency programs.    

The volume and price of commodity/byproduct materials we sell.    

The volume and price of carbon offset sales created by the destruction
of ozone-depleting refrigerants.    

For the three months ended October 1, 2016
gross profit was 30.9% an increase of 35.8% or $2.2 million compared to 22.1% in the three months ended October 3, 2015. Our gross
profit increased primarily due to two items, the payment of $1.3 million carbon offset credits and $1.3 million from the move to
higher margin collecting versus replacing. This was offset by a decrease of 1% or $0.4 million in retail sales due to product
mix and market pressures. 

For the nine months ended October 1, 2016
gross profit was 27.2% an increase of $1.1 million compared to 23.3% in the same nine months ended October 3, 2015. Our gross
profit increased primarily due to the carbon offset credit payment of $1.3 million in the third quarter and the move to collect
versus replacement programs which have a higher gross margin. This was offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in retail sales due
to price compression and product mix. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

For the three months ended October 1,
2016 SGA decreased by 5% or $0.4 million compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015. This was due to a decrease in occupancy
costs as we contracted space in our retail stores and focused on lowering the costs as we continue to look for opportunities to
operate the stores more efficiently. Advertising expense is lower as we decided to reduce advertising to focus on rebranding our
message for 2017. The increase in SGA is primarily due to adding new position to the corporate team. 

For the nine months ended October 1, 2016
SG A decreased by $0.9 million compared to the same nine months ended October 3, 2015 due to lower costs by contracting
store size, scaling back advertising and increasing efficiencies. 

Interest Expense  

For the three and nine months ended October
1, 2016, interest expense was $0.3 million and $0.9 million respectively, unchanged from the three and nine months ended October
3, 2015. Our cost of borrowing with our bank increased but due to tight inventory management and reduced replacement programs our
net borrowings under our line of credit were reduced, keeping interest expense the same. We are actively working to reduce interest
rates as our expansion plans to gain market share will require capital outlays and investment. 

Income Taxes  

For the three months ended October 1,
2016, we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes compared with a benefit of $0.3 million in the same period ended October
3, 2015. Income tax expense, for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 included a provision for income tax expense of $0.4 million
for writedown of the valuation allowance asset compared to a tax benefit of $0.9 million due to the financial losses of same period
of 2015. 

Noncontrolling Interest  

Noncontrolling interest represents 4301 s
share of AAP s net income (loss). Under the AAP joint venture agreement, ARCA and 4301 each have a 50% interest in AAP. For
the nine months ended, October 1, 2016, AAP reported net loss of $0.5 million of which $0.2 million represented the loss attributable
to noncontrolling interest compared to a loss of $1.5 million of which $0.7 million represented the loss attributable to noncontrolling
interest in the nine month period ended October 3, 2015. The operation results of AAP  are dependent upon the market prices of
commodities and on a supply of product from a limited number of sources. Management is actively working to improve our return and
limit our exposure on this investment. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash and cash equivalents as of October
1, 2016, were $1.7 million compared with $2.0 million as of January 2, 2016. Working capital, the excess of current assets
over current liabilities, decreased to $2.7 million as of October 1, 2016, compared with $4.5 million as of January 2, 2016.
The decrease was primarily the result of the classification of the term loan with PNC as a current liability, operating losses
and the pay down of accruals. 

The following table summarizes our cash
flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, and October 3, 2015 (in millions): 

Operating Activities  .  Our
net cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared with $(2.1) million
for the nine months ended October 3, 2015. The increase of cash generated from operating activities was primarily the result
of $2.0 million collection of trade receivables, $0.9 million collection of tax receivables and $0.4 million reduction of inventory.  

Investing
Activities  .  Cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the nine
months ended October 1, 2016, and the nine months ended October 3, 2015, respectively. Cash used for the purchase of
equipment was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the nine months ended October 1, 2016, and the nine months ended October 3,
2015, respectively. 

Financing Activities  . 
Our net cash used in financing activities was $3.7 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared with $3.0 million
of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended October 3, 2015.  Net cash used in financing activities
for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, was related primarily to net payments under our line of credit and the repayment of
long-term debt obligations. Net cash provided in financing activities for the nine months ended October 3, 2015, was related to
$3.2 million advance on the line of credit and $0.4 million of new debt offset by $0.6 million of payments of long term debt. 

Sources of Liquidity .     Our
principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Our principal liquidity
requirements consist of long-term debt obligations, capital expenditures and working capital. Our total capital requirements for
the next twelve months will depend upon, among other things, the number and size of ApplianceSmart stores operating during the
period, the volumes generated from recycling and appliance replacement contracts during the period and our needs related to AAP.
Currently, we have eighteen ApplianceSmart stores and seventeen recycling centers, including AAP, in operation. Approximately $0.8
million of our cash at the end of the October 1, 2016 is held in Canadian banks. 

We believe, based on the anticipated revenues
from our recycling and appliance replacement contracts, the anticipated sales per retail store, and our anticipated gross profit,
that our cash balance, anticipated funds generated from operations and our bank borrowings will be sufficient to finance our operations,
long-term debt obligations and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months. We may need additional capital to
finance our operations if our revenues are lower than anticipated, our expenses are higher than anticipated or we pursue new opportunities,
or if our Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, ( Revolving Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank,
National Association ( PNC ) is not renewed or replaced on the stated maturity date of January 31, 2017. We are currently
seeking a new bank credit facility. 

On November 8, 2016, we entered into a
securities purchase agreement with an investor under which the Company may issue up to $7.7 million principal amount of 3% Original
Issue Discount Senior Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company and related common stock purchase warrants. The principal amount
of the notes outstanding at November 8, 2016, was $0.1 million. The Notes will be issued from time to time, up to such aggregate
principal amount, at the request of the Company, subject to certain conditions, or at the option of the investor. Interest accrues
at the rate of eight percent per annum on the principal amount of the Notes outstanding from time to time, and is payable at maturity
or, if earlier, upon conversion of the Notes. We believe this financing arrangement will enhance our ability to obtain a new bank
credit facility.  Sources of additional financing, if needed in the future, may include further debt financing or the sale of
equity (Common or Preferred Stock) or other financing opportunities. There can be no assurance that such additional sources of
financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or permitted by bank credit facility. 

Outstanding Indebtedness  . 
We have a Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, ( Revolving Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank,
National Association ( PNC ) that provides us with a $15.0 million revolving line of credit. The Revolving Credit Agreement
had a stated maturity date of January 24, 2016, and was renewed on January 22, 2016. Our financial covenants were reset
in connection with this renewal. The renewed Revolving Credit Agreement has a stated maturity of January 31, 2017, if not renewed
and as a result, we have classified the revolving line of credit as a current liability. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes
a lockbox agreement and a subjective acceleration clause. The Revolving Credit Agreement is collateralized by a security interest
in substantially all of our assets and PNC is also secured by an inventory repurchase agreement with Whirlpool Corporation for
Whirlpool purchases only. We also issued a $0.8 million letter of credit in favor of Whirlpool Corporation. The Revolving
Credit Agreement requires, starting with the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016, that we meet a minimum earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, and continuing at the end of each quarter thereafter, that we meet a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0. The Revolving Credit Agreement limits investments we can purchase, the amount of other debt and leases
we can incur, the amount of loans we can issue to our affiliates and the amount we can spend on fixed assets, along with prohibiting
the payment of dividends. In the January 22, 2016 renewal, the affiliate loan balance is capped at $1.0 million on December 31,
2015, and thereafter. As of October 1, 2016, we were in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant; however, PNC
notified us that we exceeded the affiliate loan limitation, and we have disputed such notice. As of January 2, 2016, we were
not in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which was subsequently waived with the January 22, 2016
renewal. 

The interest rate on the Revolving Credit
Agreement, in our renewal agreement on January 22, 2016, is PNC Base Rate plus 1.75% to 3.25%, or 1-, 2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR
Rate plus 2.75% to 4.25%, with the rate being dependent on our level of fixed charge coverage. The PNC Base Rate shall mean, for
any day, a fluctuating per annum rate of interest equal to the highest of (i) the interest rate per annum announced from
time to time by PNC as its prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Open Rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate
plus 100 basis points (1%).  As of October 1, 2016, the outstanding line of credit balance was $9.8 million with a weighted
average interest rate of 8.75%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default premium. As of January 2, 2016, the outstanding
line of credit balance was $12.7 million with a weighted average interest rate of 7.25%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default
premium. 

The amount of revolving borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Agreement is based on a formula using accounts receivable and inventories.  We may not have
access to the full $15 million revolving line of credit due to the formula using accounts receivable and inventories, the
amount of the letter of credit issued in favor of Whirlpool Corporation and the amount of outstanding loans between PNC and
our AAP joint venture. As of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, our available borrowing capacity under the
Revolving Credit Agreement was $3.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. 

On January 24, 2011, we entered into
a $2.55 million Term Loan ( Term Loan ) with PNC Bank to refinance the mortgage on our California facility. The Term
Loan is payable as follows, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination of the Revolving
Credit Agreement: 119 consecutive monthly principal payments of $21,000 plus interest commencing on February 1, 2011, and
continuing on the first day of each month thereafter followed by a 120th payment of all unpaid principal, interest and fees on
February 1, 2021. If the Revolving Credit Agreement is not renewed, a balloon payment of $1.02  million in principal plus interest
and additional fees will be due on January 31, 2017. The Term Loan is collateralized with our California facility located in Compton,
California. The Term Loan interest rate is PNC Base Rate plus 2.25% to 3.75%, or 1-, 2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR Rate plus 3.25% to
4.75%, with the rate being dependent on our level of fixed charge coverage. 

The interest rate will be fixed for the
first half of 2016 at PNC Base Rate plus 3.75%, or 1-,2- or 3-month PNC LIBOR Rate plus 4.75%. As of October 1, 2016, the weighted
average interest rate was 9.25%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default rate premium. As of January 2, 2016, the weighted
average interest rate was 7.75%, which was the PNC Base Rate plus a default rate premium. As of October 1, 2016, the balance due
on the Term Loan is classified as current as the maturity of our credit facility is January 31, 2017. 

On March 10, 2011, AAP entered
into three separate commercial term loans ( Term Loans ) with Susquehanna Bank, pursuant to the guidelines of the
U.S. Small Business Administration 7(a) Loan Program. The total amount of the Term Loans is $4.75 million, split into
three separate loans for $2.1  million, $1.4  million,  and $1.25  million. The Term Loans mature on March 10, 2021 and bear an
interest rate of Prime plus 2.75%. As of October 1, 2016, and January 2, 2016, the interest rate was 6.00%. 
Borrowings under the Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of AAP along with liens on the business assets
and certain personal assets of the owners of 4301 Operations, LLC. We are a guarantor of the Term Loans along with 4301
Operations, LLC and its owners. In connection with these Term Loans, Susquehanna Bank also has a security interest in the
assets of the Company. 

In March of 2015, an entity
controlled by one of the noncontrolling interest holders of AAP loaned AAP $0.3 million through the issuance of promissory
notes. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 8%. In May of 2015, one of the March 2015 notes totaling $125,000 was
repaid in full by AAP. In February 2016, an entity controlled by one of the noncontrolling interest holders of AAP loaned AAP
$100,000 through the issuance of an 8% promissory note. In August 2016, the remaining notes totaling $0.3 million were repaid
with the collection of carbon offset program revenues. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Pronouncements  

The accompanying unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of United States generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ), which require estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in these
financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates,
and any such differences may be material to the financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies may involve
a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation
of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different
from reported results. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2015, the FASB issued a standard
that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. We adopted the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of
2016 and prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $0.1 million reduction
of other assets and a $01 million reduction of the current portion of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the
period ended December 31, 2015. 

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  

In May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard
on revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting
revenue. The new standard is effective for us in fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either a retrospective or a cumulative
effect transition method. We are currently assessing the impact of implementing the new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a standard requiring an entity s management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements. The
guidance also sets forth a series of disclosures that are required in the event the entity s management concludes that there
is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard becomes effective for us
in the annual financial statements for fiscal 2016 and requires an ongoing evaluation at each interim and annual period thereafter.
We are currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued a standard
that primarily requires organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing
the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Market Risk and Impact of Inflation  

Interest Rate Risk .   We
do not believe there is any significant risk related to interest rate fluctuations on our long-term fixed-rate debt. There is interest
rate risk on the line of credit, PNC Term Loan and Susquehanna Bank Term Loans, since our interest rate floats. The outstanding
balance on our floating rate loans as of October 1, 2016, was approximately $14.2 million. Based on average floating
rate borrowings of $15.7 million, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in the applicable interest rate would have caused our interest
expense to change for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016, by approximately $39,000 and $117,000. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.    We
currently generate revenues in Canada.  The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is U.S. dollars.
It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes; however, the effect on reported revenue
and net earnings can be estimated.  We estimate that the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar had an immaterial impact
on revenues and net income for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016.  We do not currently hedge
foreign currency fluctuations and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future. 

We do not hold any derivative financial instruments
nor do we hold any securities for trading or speculative purposes. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

We have established disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), at October 1, 2016. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at October 1, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART II.        Other
Information  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  

On March 6, 2015, a complaint was
filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California by Jason Feola, individually and as a
representative of a putative class consisting of purchasers of the Company s common stock between March 15, 2012 and
February 11, 2015, against Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and certain current and former officers of the
Company. Mr. Feola, pursuant to terms of his retainer agreement with The Rosen Law Firm, certified that he purchased 240
shares of the Company s common stock for $984 in total consideration. In May 2015, the Company and the individual
defendants were served the complaint. In July 2015, the Company and the individual defendants received an amended complaint.
The complaint alleges that misstatements and omissions occurred in press releases and filings by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and that these misstatements or omissions constitute violations of Section 20 (a) and
Section 10(b) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In October 2015, the court held a hearing on the
Company's motion to dismiss the complaint. In November 2015, the Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss the
amended complaint. The Court s order provided that the dismissal was without prejudice and that the plaintiffs could
file an amended complaint within 21 days of the issuance of the order. In December 2015, the Company and the individual
defendants were served with a second amended complaint. In May 2016, the court held a hearing on the Company's motion to
dismiss the second amended complaint.  On October 21, 2016 the court entered a final judgment to dismiss the class
action complaint with prejudice and the plaintiff has 30 days to appeal the dismissal. 

On November 6, 2015, a complaint was filed
in the Minnesota District Court for Hennepin County, Minnesota, by David Gray and Michael Boller, purporting to bring suit derivatively
and on behalf of the Company against twelve current and former officers and directors of the Company. The complaint alleges that
the defendants breached their fiduciary duties based on substantially similar allegations to those asserted in Mr. Feola's putative
securities class action complaint, and that the defendants have been unjustly enriched as a result thereof. The complaint seeks
damages, disgorgement, an award of attorneys  fees and other expenses, and an order compelling changes to the Company s
corporate governance and internal procedures. This matter has been stayed by the court, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,
until the United States District Court for the Central District of California determines the legal sufficiency of Mr. Feola's complaint
or other specified developments occur in that case. This matter has been submitted to our insurance carriers. 

Given the uncertainty of litigation we cannot reasonably estimate
the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. The Company maintains liability insurance policies that
may reduce the Company s exposure, if any. 

In February 2012, various individuals
commenced a class action lawsuit against Whirlpool Corporation ( Whirlpool ) and various distributors of Whirlpool
products, including Sears, The Home Depot, Lowe s and us, alleging certain appliances Whirlpool sold through its distribution
chain, which includes us, were improperly designated with the ENERGY STAR    qualification rating established by
the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. The claims against us include breach of warranty claims,
as well as various state consumer protection claims. The class action settlement was preliminarily approved in June 2016 and members
have until March 2017 to opt out of the class or object to the settlement. Whirlpool has offered to fully indemnify and defend
its distributors in this lawsuit,.  We are monitoring Whirlpool s defense of the claims and believe the possibility
of a material loss is remote. 

AMTIM Capital, Inc.
( AMTIM ) acts as our representative to market our recycling services in Canada under an arrangement that pays AMTIM
for revenues generated by recycling services in Canada as set forth in the agreements between the parties.  A dispute has
arisen between AMTIM and us with respect to the calculation of amounts due to AMTIM pursuant to the agreement.  In a lawsuit
filed in the province of Ontario, AMTIM claims a discrepancy in the calculation of fees due to AMTIM by us of approximately $2,000.
Although the outcome of this claim is uncertain, we believe that no further amounts are due under the terms of the agreement and
will continue to defend our position relative to this lawsuit. 

We are party from time to time to ordinary
course disputes that we do not believe to be material or have merit. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these
ordinary course disputes. 

Sales and Use Taxes:   We
operate in twenty-three states in the U.S. and in various provinces in Canada. From time to time, we are subject to sales and
use tax audits that could result in additional taxes, penalties and interest owed to various taxing authorities. 

As previously disclosed, the California Board
of Equalization ( BOE ) is conducting a sales and use tax examination covering the California operations of Appliance
Recycling Centers of America, Inc. (the  Company ) for 2011, 2012 and 2013. The Company believed it was exempt from
collecting sales taxes under service agreements with utility customers that included appliance replacement programs. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the Company received communication from the BOE indicating they are not in agreement with the Company s
interpretation of the law. As a result, the Company applied for and, as of February 9, 2015, received approval to participate in
the California Board of Equalization s Managed Audit Program. The period covered under this program includes 2011, 2012,
2013 and extends through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. At this time, our best estimate of the amount that will
be assessed by the BOE covering all periods under audit is approximately $4.1 million in sales tax and interest related to the
appliance replacement programs that we administered on behalf of our customers on which we did not assess, collect or remit sales
tax. The Company has been working with outside consultants to arrive at our assessment estimate and will continue to engage the
services of these sales tax experts throughout the Managed Audit Program process. The sales tax amounts that we will likely
be assessed relate to transactions in the period under examination by the BOE. Such assessment, however, will be subject to protest
and appeal, and would not need to be funded until the matter has been fully resolved. Resolution could take up to two years. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds  

As described in Item 5, below, on November 8, 2016, the Company
issued and agreed to issue shares of Common Stock and Notes and Warrants which are convertible or exercisable into shares of Common
Stock. The Common Stock, Notes and Warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ), provided under Section 4(a)(2) thereof and pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation
D only to  accredited investors  (as defined under Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act) based in part on the representations
and warranties of the Investor. 

Item 3.    Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

As of October 1, 2016, ARCA had borrowings
totaling $1.1 million on its Term Loan with PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC ) and $9.8 million under its $15 million
Revolving Credit Agreement. The PNC loan agreements ( Loan Agreements ) require ARCA to, among other things; satisfy
certain financial covenants as of the end of each fiscal quarter. A failure to satisfy any covenant constitutes an event of default
under the Loan Agreements. As of October 1, 2016, PNC notified ARCA that it was not in compliance with a covenant relating to loans
to affiliates. ARCA has notified PNC that it disputes this determination, and is working with PNC for a resolution.  

Item 5.    Other Information  

On November 8, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement
(the  Purchase Agreement ) with Energy Efficiency Investments, LLC, an accredited Investor (the  Investor )
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue up to $7,731,959 principal amount of 3% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible
Promissory Notes of the Company (the  Notes ) and related common stock purchase warrants (the  Warrants ).
The Notes will be issued from time to time, up to such aggregate principal amount, at the request of the Company, subject to certain
conditions, or at the option of the Investor. Interest accrues at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum on the principal amount
of the Notes outstanding from time to time, and is payable at maturity or, if earlier, upon conversion of the Notes. Interest is
payable in cash or, subject to certain conditions, in shares of Common Stock at the Company s option. The Company has the
right to prepay the Notes under certain circumstances. At the initial closing on November 8, 2016, we issued Notes for $103,000,
which are convertible into 166,817 shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company
(the  Common Stock ), at a conversion price of $0.618 per share. In connection with the Note issued at the initial
closing, the Company issued five-year Warrants to purchase 166,817 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.68 per share.
The Notes may not be converted and the Warrants may not be exercised to the extent such conversion or exercise would result in
the investor owning more than 9.99% of the Company s common stock. With each Note subsequently issued under the Purchase
Agreement, the Company will also issue a Warrant for a number of shares equal to the number of shares issuable upon conversion
of such Note. The Notes and Warrants are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. The conversion price for the Notes is subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances, but in no event to less than $0.50 (or in the case of default, in no event less than $0.325),
subject to equitable adjustment. The Warrants include a cashless exercise right. If the Company fails to make timely delivery of
shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, the Company will be subject to certain liquidated damages
provisions. At the initial closing the Company issued 619,547 shares of Common Stock to the Investor as Commitment Shares for the
convertible promissory note arrangements. The Company will not issue shares upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants
to the extent the aggregate number of shares issued under the Purchase Agreement would exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately before the date of the Purchase Agreement, unless and until the Company obtains shareholder
approval permitting such issuances in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Capital Market. 

The Purchase Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, the Investor has the right to participate in certain
subsequent financings by the Company, subject to certain limitations. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Investor will have
the right to include the shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes and Warrants in certain registration statements filed by the
Company. 

The above is a summary of the material
terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Notes and the Warrants and is qualified in its entirety by the full terms
and conditions of such agreements which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.3 and are hereby incorporated by reference.

  Limitations on the Number of Shares Issuable . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall
not issue to the Purchaser any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes or exercise of Warrants issued hereunder to the
extent such shares, after giving effect to such issuance and when added to the number of shares of Common Stock issued and issuable
as Commitment Shares or upon conversion of any other Notes or exercise of any other Warrants issued hereunder would exceed (i) 19.9%
of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the date of this Agreement (the   Maximum Share
Amount  ) or (ii) 19.9% of the total voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately before

Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public

of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of the Purchaser, the Company shall within two Trading
Days confirm orally and in writing to the Purchaser the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. If on any attempted
conversion of a Note or exercise of a Warrant, the issuance of shares of Common Stock would exceed the Maximum Share Amount or
the Maximum Voting Amount, and the Company shall not have previously obtained Stockholder Approval at the time of exercise, then
the Company shall issue to the Purchaser such number of shares of Common Stock as may be issued below the Maximum Share Amount
or Maximum Voting Amount, as the case may be, and, with respect to the remainder of the aggregate number of shares, the Notes and
Warrants shall not be convertible or exercisable until and unless Stockholder Approval has been obtained.   Stockholder
Approval   means approval by the stockholders of the Company (i) amending the Company s certificate or articles
of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock so that the number of authorized but unissued shares

or articles of incorporation in connection with the Company s proposal to redomicile the Company from Minnesota to Nevada,
and (ii) permitting the issuance of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount and Maximum Voting Amount,

is bound or affected; except in the case of each of clauses (ii) and (iii), such as would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. 

(e)        Filings,
Consents and Approvals. The Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice
to, or make any filing or registration with, any court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority or other

the Stockholder Approval relating to an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, the remaining Securities
will be, duly authorized and, when issued and paid for in accordance with the applicable Transaction Documents, will be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens imposed by the Company other than restrictions on transfer

Stock Equivalents. The issuance and sale of the Securities will not obligate the Company to issue shares of Common Stock or other
securities to any Person (other than the Purchaser) and will not result in a right of any holder of Company securities to adjust
the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such securities. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued in material compliance with

contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement or non-competition agreement, or any other contract
or agreement or any restrictive covenant in favor of any third party, and the continued employment of each such executive officer
does not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. The Company
and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where the failure to be in compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Adverse Effect. 

(m)         Regulatory
Permits . The Company and the Subsidiaries possess all certificates, authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate federal,
state, local or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses as described in the SEC Reports,

is material to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Liens
as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made
of such property by the Company and the Subsidiaries and (ii) Liens for the payment of federal, state or other taxes, for which
appropriate reserves have been made therefor in accordance with GAAP and, the payment of which is neither delinquent nor subject

property rights and similar rights as described in the SEC Reports as necessary or required for use in connection with their respective
businesses and for which the failure so to have would have a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the   Intellectual
Property Rights  ). None of, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received a notice (written or otherwise) that
any of, the Intellectual Property Rights has expired, terminated or been abandoned, or is expected to expire or terminate or be
abandoned, within two (2) years from the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received, since the
date of the latest audited financial statements included within the SEC Reports, a written notice of a claim or otherwise has any
knowledge that the Intellectual Property Rights violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person, except as would not have or
reasonably be expected to not have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, all such Intellectual Property Rights
are enforceable and there is no existing infringement by another Person of any of the Intellectual Property Rights. The Company

its business without a significant increase in cost.

rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission thereunder that are effective as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date.
The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that:

as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management s general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded

to any differences. The Company and the Subsidiaries have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the Company and the Subsidiaries and designed such disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. The Company s
certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Subsidiaries
as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act (such date, the   Evaluation
Date  ). The Company presented in its most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions of the
certifying officers about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on their evaluations as of the Evaluation

terminating such registration. Except as set forth on  Schedule 3.1(w) , (i) the Company has not, in the 12 months preceding

in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under
a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Company s certificate of incorporation (or similar
charter documents) or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or would become applicable to the Purchaser as a result of
the Purchaser and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under the Transaction Documents, including
without limitation as a result of the Company s issuance of the Securities and the Purchaser s ownership of the Securities.

Documents, the Company confirms that neither it nor any other Person acting on its behalf has provided the Purchaser or any of
its agents or counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute material, non-public information. The

15 of the Exchange Act. The Purchaser has the authority and is duly and legally qualified to purchase and own the Securities. The
Purchaser is able to bear the risk of such investment for an indefinite period and to afford a complete loss thereof. The Purchaser
has had no position, office or other material relationship within the past two years with the Company or persons known to the Purchaser
to be affiliates of the Company, and is not a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or an  associated person 
(as such term is defined under the FINRA Membership and Registration Rules Section 1011). 

(d)        Experience
of the Purchaser. The Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication, and experience
in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the
Securities, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.  

(e)        Compliance
with Securities Act; Reliance on Exemptions. The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Securities have not been registered
under the 1933 Act or any applicable state securities laws, by reason of their issuance in a transaction that does not require
registration under the 1933 Act, and that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition is registered
under the 1933 Act or any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from such registration. The Purchaser understands and
agrees that the Securities are being offered and sold to the Purchaser in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration
requirements of United States federal and state securities laws and regulations and that the Company is relying in part upon the
truth and accuracy of, and the Purchaser s compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments
and understandings of the Purchaser set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility
of the Purchaser to acquire the Securities.  

(f)          General Solicitation . The Purchaser is not purchasing the Securities as a result of any advertisement, article, notice
or other communication regarding the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television
or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement. 

(g)        Opportunity
to Obtain Information. The Purchaser has been furnished with or has had access to the EDGAR Website of the Commission to the Company s
SEC Reports filed with the Commission. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchaser has been afforded (i) the opportunity to
ask such questions as the Purchaser deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Company concerning
the merits and risks of acquiring the Securities; (ii) the right of access to information about the Company and its financial
condition, results of operations, business, properties, management and prospects sufficient to enable the Purchaser to evaluate
the Securities; and (iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional information that the Company possesses or can acquire without
unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to acquiring the Securities.  

(h)        No
Governmental Review. The Purchaser understands that no United States federal or state agency or any other governmental or state
agency has passed on or made recommendations or endorsement of the Securities or the suitability of the investment in the Securities
nor have such authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the investment.  

(i)          Certain Transactions and Confidentiality . Other than consummating the transactions contemplated hereunder, the Purchaser
has not directly or indirectly, nor has any Person acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with the Purchaser, executed
any purchases or sales, including Short Sales, of the securities of the Company during the period commencing as of the time that
the Purchaser first received a term sheet (written or oral) from the Company or any other Person representing the Company setting
forth the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereunder and ending immediately prior to the execution hereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case that the Purchaser is or becomes a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers
manage separate portions of the Purchaser s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment
decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of the Purchaser s assets, the representation set forth
above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision
to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement. Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement, the Purchaser has maintained
the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms of this
transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall constitute a representation
or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect to the identification of the availability of, or securing of, available shares
to borrow in order to effect Short Sales or similar transactions in the future. 

The Company acknowledges
and agrees that the representations contained in Section 3.2 shall not modify, amend or affect the Purchaser s right to rely
on the Company s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any representations and warranties contained
in any other Transaction Document or any other document or instrument executed and/or delivered in connection with this Agreement
or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby. 

ARTICLE IV. 
OTHER AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES 

4.1        
  Transfer Restrictions . 

(a)         The Securities may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection with any transfer
of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an Affiliate of the
Purchaser or in connection with a pledge as contemplated in Section 4.1(b), the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide
to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance
of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration
of such transferred Securities under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. 

(b)         The Purchaser agrees to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 4.1, of a legend on any of the Securities
in the following form: 

[NEITHER] THIS SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES
INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY IS [EXERCISABLE] [CONVERTIBLE]] HAS [NOT] BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL
TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. THIS SECURITY [AND THE
SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON [EXERCISE] [CONVERSION] OF THIS SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT
WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN  ACCREDITED INVESTOR  AS DEFINED
IN RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES. 

The Company acknowledges
and agrees that the Purchaser may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a registered broker-dealer
or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities to a financial institution that is an  accredited investor 
as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and who agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement  and ,
if required under the terms of such arrangement, the Purchaser may transfer pledged or secured Securities to the pledgees or secured
parties. Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the
pledgee, secured party, or pledger, shall be required in connection therewith. Further, no notice shall be required of such pledge.
At the appropriate Purchaser s expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or
secured party of Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities .  

(c)         Certificates evidencing the Underlying Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b)
hereof): (i) while a registration statement (including the Registration Statement) covering the resale of such security is effective
under the Securities Act, (ii) following any sale of such Underlying Shares pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) if such Underlying Shares
are eligible for sale under Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information
required under Rule 144 as to such Underlying Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, or (iv) if such legend
is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued
by the staff of the Commission). The Company shall cause its counsel to issue a legal opinion to the Transfer Agent promptly after
any of the events described in (i)-(iv) in the preceding sentence if required by the Transfer Agent to effect the removal of the
legend hereunder (with a copy to the applicable Purchaser and its broker). If all or any portion of a Note is converted at a time
when there is an effective registration statement to cover the resale of the Underlying Shares, or if such Underlying Shares may
be sold under Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required
under Rule 144 as to such Underlying Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, or if such legend is not otherwise
required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the
staff of the Commission) then such Underlying Shares shall be issued free of all legends. The Company agrees that following the
Effective Date or at such time as such legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, no later than three (3)
Trading Days following the delivery by the Purchaser to the Company or the Transfer Agent of a certificate representing Underlying
Shares, as applicable, issued with a restrictive legend (such third Trading Day, the   Legend Removal Date  ),
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a certificate representing such shares that is free from all restrictive and
other legends. The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to the Transfer Agent that enlarge the
restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 4. Certificates for Underlying Shares subject to legend removal hereunder shall
be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Purchaser by crediting the account of the Purchaser s prime broker with the Depository
Trust Company System as directed by the Purchaser. 

(d)        In
addition to the Purchaser s other available remedies, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser, in cash, as partial liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000.00 of Underlying Shares (based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date such
Securities are submitted to the Transfer Agent) delivered for removal of the restrictive legend and subject to Section 4.1(c),
$10.00 per Trading Day (increasing to $20.00 per Trading Day seven (7) Trading Days after such Legend Removal Date) for each Trading
Day commencing two (2) Trading Days after the Legend Removal Date until such certificate is delivered without a legend. Nothing
herein shall limit the Purchaser s right to pursue actual damages for the Company s failure to deliver certificates
representing any Securities as required by the Transaction Documents, and the Purchaser shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief.  

4.2        
  Acknowledgment of Dilution . The Company acknowledges that the issuance of the Securities may result in dilution of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, which dilution may be substantial under certain market conditions. The Company further
acknowledges that its obligations under the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, its obligation to issue the Underlying
Shares pursuant to the Transaction Documents, are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any right of set off, counterclaim,
delay or reduction, regardless of the effect of any such dilution or any claim the Company may have against the Purchaser and regardless
of the dilutive effect that such issuance may have on the ownership of the other shareholders of the Company. In the event of an
issuance of stock involving tranches or other multiple closings, the anti-dilution adjustment shall be calculated as if all stock
was issued at the Closing. 

4.3        
  Furnishing of Information; Public Information . 

(a)         Until the earliest of the time that (i) the Purchaser owns no Securities, or (ii) the Warrants have expired, the Company
covenants to maintain the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to timely file
(or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company
after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act even if the Company is not then subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act. 

(b)         At any time during the period commencing from the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof and ending at such time that
all of the Securities may be sold without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) and otherwise
without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144, if the Company shall fail for any reason to satisfy the current public
information requirement under Rule 144(c) (a   Public Information Failure  ) then, in addition to the Purchaser s
other available remedies, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser, in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the Securities, an amount in cash equal to one percent (1.0%)
of the aggregate amount of the Note eligible to be converted at the time of the Public Information Failure of the Purchaser s
Securities on the day of a Public Information Failure and on every thirtieth (30 th ) day (pro-rated for periods totaling
less than thirty days) thereafter until the earlier of (a) the date such Public Information Failure is cured and (b) such time
that such public information is no longer required for the Purchaser to transfer the Underlying Shares pursuant to Rule 144. The
payments to which the Purchaser shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 4.3(b) are referred to herein as   Public Information
Failure Payments .  Public Information Failure Payments shall be paid on the earlier of (i) the last day of the calendar
month during which such Public Information Failure Payments are incurred and (ii) the third (3 rd ) Business Day after
the event or failure giving rise to the Public Information Failure Payments is cured. In the event the Company fails to make Public
Information Failure Payments in a timely manner, such Public Information Failure Payments shall bear interest at the rate of one
and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Nothing herein shall limit the Purchaser s
right to pursue actual damages for the Public Information Failure, and the Purchaser shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. 

4.4        
  Integration . The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect
of any security (as defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities
in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Securities or that would be integrated
with the offer or sale of the Securities for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such that it would require
shareholder approval prior to the closing of such other transaction unless shareholder approval is obtained before the closing
of such subsequent transaction. 

4.5        
  Conversion and Exercise Procedures . The form of Notice of Conversion included in the Note sets forth the totality
of the procedures required of the Purchaser in order to convert the Note. Without limiting the preceding sentences, no ink-original
Notice of Exercise or Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or
notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required in order to convert the Note or of any Notice of Exercise form be required
in order to exercise the Warrant. No additional legal opinion, other information, or instructions shall be required of the Purchaser
to convert its Note or to exercise its Warrant. The Company shall honor conversions of the Note and exercises of the Warrant and
shall deliver Underlying Shares in accordance with the terms, conditions, and time periods set forth in the Transaction Documents. 

4.6        
  Securities Laws Disclosure; Publicity . The Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Transaction
Documents as exhibits thereto (the   Form 8-K  ), with the Commission within the time required by the Exchange
Act. The Company and the Purchaser shall consult with each other in issuing any other press releases with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and neither the Company nor the Purchaser shall issue any such press release nor otherwise make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the Company, with respect to any press release of the Purchaser, or without the prior consent
of the Purchaser, with respect to any press release of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed,
denied, or conditioned except if such disclosure is required by law, in which case the disclosing party shall promptly provide
the other party with prior notice of such public statement or communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
publicly disclose the name of the Purchaser, or include the name of the Purchaser in any filing with the Commission or any regulatory
agency or Trading Market, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, except to the extent such disclosure is required
by law or Trading Market regulations, in which case the Company shall provide the Purchaser with prior notice of such disclosure
permitted hereunder. 

4.7        
  Shareholder Rights Plan . No claim will be made or enforced by the Company or, with the consent of the Company, any
other Person, that the Purchaser is an  Acquiring Person  under any control share acquisition, business combination,
poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or similar anti-takeover plan or arrangement in effect or hereafter
adopted by the Company, or that the Purchaser could be deemed to trigger the provisions of any such plan or arrangement, by virtue
of receiving Securities under the Transaction Documents. 

4.8        
  Non-Public Information . Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents, the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other Person acting on its behalf, will
provide the Purchaser or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information,
unless prior thereto the Purchaser shall have entered into a written agreement with the Company regarding the confidentiality and
use of such information. The Company understands and confirms that the Purchaser shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in
effecting transactions in securities of the Company. 

4.9        
  Use of Proceeds . The Company shall use the net proceeds hereunder as set forth on  Schedule 4.9  attached hereto. 

4.10         
  Indemnification of the Purchaser . Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.10, the Company will indemnify and
hold the Purchaser and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, managers, partners, employees and agents (and any other
Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title),
each Person who controls the Purchaser (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
and the directors, officers, shareholders, agents, members, managers, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a functionally
equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons

damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys 
fees and costs of investigation that any such Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of or relating to (a) any material
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or in the other
Transaction Documents or (b) any action instituted against the Purchaser Parties in any capacity, or any of them or their respective
Affiliates, by any shareholder of the Company who is not an Affiliate of such Purchaser Party, with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (unless such action is based upon a breach of such Purchaser Party s representations,
warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such Purchaser Party may have with
any such shareholder or any violations by such Purchaser Party of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Purchaser
Party that constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance). If any action shall be brought against any
Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify
the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate
in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Purchaser Party except to the
extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed
after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Purchaser
Party, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel.
The Company will not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by the Purchaser Party effected
without the Company s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, denied, or conditioned; or
(z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in
the other Transaction Documents. The indemnification required by this Section 4.10 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount
thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity agreements
contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Purchaser Party against the Company or others
and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law. 

4.11         
  Reservation and Listing of Securities . 

(a)          As of the first installment Closing, the Company shall have commenced the process of preparation of (and thereafter be actively
prosecuting) its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, one of the items of which shall be the Company s proposal to amend the
Company s certificate or articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock so that the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is at least the Required Minimum, or to include such number of authorized
shares of Common Stock in the certificate or articles of incorporation in connection with the Company s proposal to redomicile
the Company from Minnesota to Nevada, which proposal(s) shall be actively supported and unanimously recommended by the Board of
Directors; and upon the effectiveness of such amendment the Company shall reserve the Required Minimum from its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock and, thereafter, the Company shall maintain a reserve from its duly authorized shares of Common Stock for
issuance pursuant to the Transaction Documents in such amount as may then be required to fulfill its obligations in full under
the Transaction Documents, such that, on a monthly basis, the Company will adjust the reserve as necessary to make sure that of
the Required Minimum is available. 

(b)         If, on any date, the number of authorized but unissued (and otherwise unreserved) shares of Common Stock is less than the
Required Minimum on such date, then the Board of Directors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Company s
certificate or articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to at least the
Required Minimum at such time, as soon as possible and in any event not later than the 90 th  day after such date. 

(c)         The Company shall, if applicable: (i) in the time and manner required by the principal Trading Market, prepare and file
with such Trading Market an additional shares listing application covering a number of shares of Common Stock at least equal to
the Required Minimum on the date of such application, (ii) take all steps necessary to cause such shares of Common Stock to be
approved for listing or quotation on such Trading Market as soon as possible thereafter, (iii) provide to the Purchaser evidence
of such listing or quotation and (iv) maintain the listing or quotation of such Common Stock on any date at least equal to the
Required Minimum on such date on such Trading Market or another Trading Market. 

4.12         
  Participation in Future Financing . The provisions of this Section 4.12 shall not be applicable unless and until Stockholder
Approval thereof has been obtained. 

(a)         For so long as any portion of any of the Notes is outstanding, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents, or debt for cash consideration, Indebtedness, assignment, or any combination of units
hereof (a   Subsequent Financing  ), the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in up to an amount of the
Subsequent Financing equal to 100% of the Subsequent Financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent
Financing, unless the Subsequent Financing is an underwritten public offering, in which case the Company shall notify the Purchaser
of such public offering when it is lawful for the Company to do so, but the Purchaser shall not be entitled to purchase any particular
amount of such public offering without the approval of the lead underwriter of such underwritten public offering. If the Company
fails to permit the Purchaser to participate in any Subsequent Financing as provided in this Section 4.12, then, in addition to
the Purchaser s other available remedies, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser, as partial liquidated damages and not as
a penalty, the sum of $50,000.00 (either in cash or in the form of a convertible note on terms and conditions substantially similar
to the terms and conditions of the Notes, in each case at the sole option of the Purchaser). 

(b)          At least five (5) Trading Days prior to the closing of the Subsequent Financing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser
a written notice of its intention to effect a Subsequent Financing (  Pre-Notice  ), which Pre-Notice shall ask
the Purchaser if it wants to review the details of such financing (such additional notice, a   Subsequent Financing Notice  ).
Upon the request of the Purchaser, and only upon a request by the Purchaser, for a Subsequent Financing Notice, the Company shall
promptly, but no later than one (1) Trading Day after such request, deliver a Subsequent Financing Notice to the Purchaser. The
Subsequent Financing Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Subsequent Financing, the amount of
proceeds intended to be raised thereunder and the Person or Persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed
to be effected and shall include a term sheet or similar document relating thereto as an attachment. 

(c)         If the Purchaser desires to participate in such Subsequent Financing, the Purchaser must provide written notice to the Company
by not later than 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after the Purchaser has received the
Pre-Notice that the Purchaser is willing to participate in the Subsequent Financing, the amount of the Purchaser s participation,
and representing and warranting that the Purchaser has such funds ready, willing, and available for investment on the terms set
forth in the Subsequent Financing Notice. If the Company receives no such notice from the Purchaser as of such fifth (5 th )
Trading Day, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have notified the Company that it does not elect to participate. 

(d)          If by 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day after the Purchaser has received the Pre-Notice,
notifications by the Purchaser of its willingness to participate in the Subsequent Financing (or to cause their designees to participate)
is, in the aggregate, less than the total amount of the Subsequent Financing, then the Company may effect the remaining portion
of such Subsequent Financing on the terms and with the Persons set forth in the Subsequent Financing Notice. 

(e)          [Reserved] 

(f)          [Reserved] 

(g)        The
Company and the Purchaser agree that if the Purchaser elects to participate in the Subsequent Financing, the transaction documents
related to the Subsequent Financing shall not include any term or provision whereby the Purchaser shall be required to agree to
any restrictions on trading as to any of the Securities purchased hereunder or be required to consent to any amendment to or termination
of, or grant any waiver, release or the like under or in connection with, this Agreement, without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser.   

(h)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.12 and unless otherwise agreed
to by the Purchaser, the Company shall either confirm in writing to the Purchaser that the transaction with respect to the Subsequent
Financing has been abandoned or shall publicly disclose its intention to issue the securities in the Subsequent Financing, in either
case in such a manner such that the Purchaser will not be in possession of any material, non-public information, by the tenth (10 th )
Business Day following delivery of the Subsequent Financing Notice. If by such tenth (10 th ) Business Day, no public
disclosure regarding a transaction with respect to the Subsequent Financing has been made, and no notice regarding the abandonment
of such transaction has been received by the Purchaser, such transaction shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the Purchaser
shall not be deemed to be in possession of any material, non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  

(i)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.12 shall not apply in respect of an Exempt Issuance. 

4.13         
  Subsequent Equity Sales . 

(a)         
 From the date hereof until such time that the Purchaser no longer holds the Note, in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received and wishes to accept a bona fide offer from a Person(s) other than the Purchaser (the   Third-Party
Offer  ), to effect or enter into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (or a combination of units thereof) involving a Variable Rate Transaction (the   Offered
Securities  ), the Company shall give notice thereof to the Purchaser, which notice shall include a description of the
material economic terms and conditions of such Third-Party Offer in connection with the Offered Securities (the   Sale
Notice  ).   Variable Rate Transaction   means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells
any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive, additional
shares of Common Stock either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon, and/or

to the Transaction Documents is increased or decreased by statute or any official governmental action subsequent to the date hereof,
the new maximum contract rate of interest allowed by law will be the Maximum Rate applicable to the Transaction Documents from
the effective date thereof forward, unless such application is precluded by applicable law. If under any circumstances whatsoever,
interest in excess of the Maximum Rate is paid by the Company to the Purchaser with respect to indebtedness evidenced by the Transaction

liquidated damages or other amounts are due and payable shall have been canceled.

to revise the Transaction Documents and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be

thereto. In addition, each and every reference to share prices and shares of Common Stock in any Transaction Document shall be
subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, and other similar transactions
of the Common Stock that occur after the date of this Agreement.

interest, if applicable. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Borrower shall make payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of the then-outstanding principal amount of this Note and accrued interest, including
guaranteed interest, if applicable, (ii) multiplied by 105%. The Holder may continue to convert the Note from the date notice
of the prepayment is given until the date of the prepayment.

  Registration of Transfers and Exchanges . 

a)

agent of the Company may treat the Person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Note Register as the owner hereof for
the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither
the Company nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

Section 4.               
  Conversion . 

a)                
  Voluntary Conversion . At any time after the Original Issue Date until this Note is no longer outstanding, this Note
shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder, at any time and from time to
time (subject to the conversion limitations set forth in Section 4(d) and Section 4(e) hereof). The Holder shall effect conversions
by delivering to the Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as  Annex A  (each, a   Notice
of Conversion  ), specifying therein the principal amount of this Note to be converted and the date on which such conversion
shall be effected (such date, the   Conversion Date  ). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion,
the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion
shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form
be required. To effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required physically to surrender this Note to the Company
unless the entire principal amount of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversions
hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable
conversion. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount(s) converted and the date of such conversion(s).
The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion within one (1) Business Day of delivery of such Notice of Conversion.
In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of
manifest error.  The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions
of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note may
be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

b)               
  Conversion Price . The fixed conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be $___, 1 
subject to adjustment herein (the   Conversion Price  ). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any
time after the occurrence of any Event of Default the Holder may require the Company to, at such Holder s option and otherwise
in accordance with the provisions for conversion herein, convert all or any part of this Note into Common Stock at the Alternate
Conversion Price. Further, if sixty-five percent (65%) of the VWAP during the ten (10) Trading Days immediately prior to the applicable
Conversion Date is less than the then-applicable Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price for such conversion and all subsequent
conversions shall be reduced to equal such price, subject to further reductions in the Conversion Price for subsequent conversions
to be calculated in the same manner. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall any per-share Conversion Price be less than fifty
cents ($0.50) unless the Alternate Conversion Price is applicable. All such determinations to be appropriately adjusted for any
stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification, or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases
the Common Stock during such measuring period. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages or declare
an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6 hereof and the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder,
at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any
such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable
law. 

c)                
  Mechanics of Conversion . 

i.                 
  Conversion Shares Issuable Upon Conversion of Principal Amount . The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion
hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount of this Note to be converted
by (y) the Conversion Price. 

ii.                
  Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion . Not later than three (3) Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the   Share
Delivery Date  ), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder (A) a certificate or certificates
representing the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of this Note, which certificate or certificates
shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those that may then be required by the Purchase Agreement)
if (i) generated on or after the six-month anniversary of the Original Issue Date (provided that the Securities are then eligible
for resale under Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required
under Rule 144 as to such Conversion Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions), (ii) such Securities are then the
subject of an effective registration statement, or (iii) such Securities are otherwise freely tradable pursuant to an applicable
exemption from registration, and (B) a bank check in the amount of accrued and unpaid interest (if the Company has elected or is
required to pay accrued interest in cash). Each certificate or all certificates required to be delivered by the Company under this
Section 4(c) shall be delivered electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation
performing similar functions. If a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares shall not be free of restrictive
legends because of the reasons set forth above, then the Conversion Shares shall bear a restrictive legend in the following form,
as appropriate:

NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE
OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE,
SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE
FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING
THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT
SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.   

iii.              
  Failure to Deliver Certificates . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such certificate or certificates are
not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written
notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Conversion, in
which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Note delivered to the Company and the Holder shall promptly
return to the Company the Common Stock certificates issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice. Whether
or not the Holder elects to rescind any such Conversion, the Company shall promptly, upon demand therefor, reimburse the Holder
in cash for any fees and costs that the Holder may have directly or indirectly incurred by virtue of such untimely delivery or
absolute delivery failure. Such fees and costs include, but are not limited to, interest charges, and margin fees, and costs of
 buy-in  in accordance with Section 4(c)(v) hereof. 

iv.              
  Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Company s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion
Shares upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action
or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any
judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation, or termination,
or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged
violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance that might otherwise limit such
obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares;  provided ,  however ,
that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action the Company may have against the Holder. In
the event the Holder of this Note shall elect to convert any or all of the outstanding principal amount hereof, the Company may
not refuse conversion based on any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has been engaged in
any violation of law, agreement, or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and
or enjoining conversion of all or part of this Note shall have been sought and obtained, and the Company posts a surety bond for
the benefit of the Holder in the amount of 150% of the outstanding principal amount of this Note, which is subject to the injunction,
which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of
which shall be payable to the Holder to the extent it obtains judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Company shall issue
Conversion Shares or, if applicable, cash, upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to
the Holder such certificate or certificates pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) by the date that is two (2) Trading Days after the Share
Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000.00 of
principal amount being converted, $10.00 per Trading Day (increasing to $20.00 per Trading Day on the seventh (7th) Trading Day
after such Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day commencing two (2) Trading Days after such Share Delivery Date until such
certificates are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual
damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6 hereof for the Company s failure to deliver Conversion Shares
within the period specified herein and the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such
rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

v.                
  Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights
available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by two (2)
Trading Days after the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii), and if after two (2) Trading Days following such Share
Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s
brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion
Shares that the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a   Buy-In  ),
then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder)
the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock
so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive
from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation
was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note
in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed
rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely
complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(c)(ii). For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total
purchase price of $11,000.00 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this Note with respect to which the actual
sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of
$10,000.00 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000.00. The
Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon
request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

vi.              
  Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock at least equal to the Required
Minimum (to be adjusted monthly) for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Note and payment of interest on this
Note, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than
the Holder (and the other holders of the Note), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions
of Section 5) upon the conversion of the then-outstanding principal amount of this Note and payment of interest hereunder. The
Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable. 

vii.             
  Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion
of this Note. As to any fraction of a share that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company
shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. 

viii.           
  Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of this Note
shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of
the issue or delivery of such certificates, provided that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that
of the Holder of this Note so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until
the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for standard
or same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion. The Company shall pay all other expenses that may reasonably be expected to
be incurred in respect of any conversion, including, but not limited to, legal opinions required for the issuance of such shares
of Common Stock and for the removal of any restrictive legends on any certificates evidencing such shares and stop transfer instructions
at the Company s transfer agent. 

d)               
  Holder s Conversion Limitations . The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and a Holder shall
not have the right to convert any portion of this Note, to the extent that after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the
applicable Notice of Conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together
with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
(as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder
and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which
such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon (i) conversion
of the remaining, unconverted principal amount of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise
or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, any other Notes) beneficially owned by
the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 4(d), beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 4(d) applies, the determination of whether this Note is convertible
(in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which principal amount of this Note is
convertible shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be the
Holder s determination of whether this Note may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates) and which principal amount of this Note is convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
To ensure compliance with this restriction, the Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company each time it delivers a Notice
of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall
have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status
as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. For purposes of this Section 4(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Company s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by
the Company, or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Company s transfer agent setting forth the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days
confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then-outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
this Note, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
The   Beneficial Ownership Limitation   shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder.
The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section 4(d), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this
Note held by the Holder and the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(d) shall continue to apply. Any such
increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Beneficial
Ownership Limitation provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity
with the terms of this Section 4(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) that may be defective or inconsistent with
the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Note. 

e)                
  Limitations on the Number of Shares Issuable . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall
not issue to the Holder any Conversion Shares upon conversion of this Note to the extent such shares after giving effect to such
issuance after conversion and when added to the number of shares of Common Stock issued and issuable upon conversion of any other
Notes or exercise of any Warrants issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement would exceed (i) 19.9% of the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately before the date of the Purchase Agreement (the   Maximum Share Amount  ) or (ii)
19.9% of the total voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately before the date of the Purchase Agreement
that are entitled to vote on a matter being voted on by holders of the Common Stock (the   Maximum Voting Amount  ),
unless and until the Company obtains shareholder approval permitting such issuances in accordance with applicable rules and regulations
of the NASDAQ Capital Market (  Stockholder Approval  ). For purposes of this Section 4(e), beneficial ownership
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 4(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder
may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual
report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent
written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written
or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding. If on any attempted conversion of this Note, the issuance of Conversion Shares would exceed
the Maximum Share Amount or the Maximum Voting Amount, and the Company shall not have previously obtained Stockholder Approval
at the time of exercise, then the Company shall issue to the Holder requesting conversion such number of Conversion Shares as may
be issued below the Maximum Share Amount or Maximum Voting Amount, as the case may be, and, with respect to the remainder of the
aggregate number of Conversion Shares, this Note shall not be convertible until and unless Stockholder Approval has been obtained. 

Section 5.               
  Certain Adjustments . 

a)                
  Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend
or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock
Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion
of, or payment of interest on, the Note), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii)
combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv)
issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the
Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which, the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding
any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall
become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination, or re-classification. 

b)               
  Subsequent Equity Sales . If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable,
sells or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces
any sale, grant, or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents entitling any Person
to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price,
the   Base Conversion Price ,  and, each such issuance, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (if the holder
of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments,
reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices, or otherwise, or due to warrants, options, or rights per share
that are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share
that is lower than the Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Conversion Price on such
date of the Dilutive Issuance), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price. Such adjustment
shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will
be made under this Section 5(b) in respect of an Exempt Issuance. If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction, the Company
shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities
may be converted or exercised. The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance
of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 5(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price,
or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the   Dilutive Issuance
Notice  ). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this
Section 5(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to acquire a number of Conversion Shares based
upon the Base Conversion Price on or after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers
to the Base Conversion Price in the Notice of Conversion. 

c)                
  Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata
to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the   Purchase Rights  ), then the Holder will be
entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights that the Holder could have
acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without
regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before
the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the
date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase
Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in
the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, or the issuance of such Purchase Rights would exceed the Maximum Share
Amount or the Maximum Voting Amount, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent
(or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right
to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the
Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation or the issuance of such Purchase Rights exceeding the Maximum Share Amount
or the Maximum Voting Amount). 

d)               
  Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Note is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend
or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock, or other securities, property or options
by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)
(a   Distribution  ), then, in each such case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Note Register of the Company, at least 10 calendar days prior to the date as of which a record
is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock
are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution, a notice stating the date as of which such record is to be taken
or such determination made, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled
to receive such Distribution; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall
not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company
shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

e)                
  Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company,
directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange
offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell,
tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the
outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification,
reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively
converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or
party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other
business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be
mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Note Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior
to the applicable effective date of such Fundamental Transaction, a notice stating the date on which such Fundamental Transaction
is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall
be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such Fundamental
Transaction; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the
validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes,
or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously
file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to convert the
Note during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction triggering such
notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

f)                
  Calculations . All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a
share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued
and outstanding. 

g)               
  Notice to the Holder . 

i.                 
  Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section
5, the Company shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting
forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.                
  Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever
form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common
Stock, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be

Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,

exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the
validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes,
or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously
file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to convert this
Note during the 20-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice

covenants to the Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein.
Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall
be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation
of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause
irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that,

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT  

APPLIANCE RECYCLING CENTERS OF AMERICA,
INC.  

Warrant Shares: _______ 
     Initial Exercise Date: ___________, 201_  

THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE
WARRANT (the   Warrant  ) certifies that, for value received, Energy Efficiency Investments, LLC, or its assigns
(the   Holder  ) is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter
set forth, at any time on or after ___________, 201_ (the   Initial Exercise Date  ), and on or prior to the close
of business on the five-year anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date (the   Termination Date  ) but not thereafter,
to subscribe for and purchase from Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the   Company  ),
up to _________ shares (as subject to adjustment hereunder, the   Warrant Shares  ) of Common Stock. The purchase
price of one share of Common Stock under this Warrant shall be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b). 

Section 1. Definitions .
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
(the   Purchase Agreement  ), dated November 8, 2016, between the Company and the Holder. 

Section 2. Exercise . 

a)        Exercise
of Warrant . Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times
on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date (i) by delivery to the Company (or such other
office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder
appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise form annexed hereto and within
three (3) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Company shall have received payment
of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier s check drawn on a United States
bank or, (ii) if available, pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in Section 2(c) below. No ink-original Notice
of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of
Exercise form be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been
exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading
Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases
of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number
of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and
the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall
deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise Form within one (1) Trading Day of receipt of such notice.  The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the
purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given
time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

b)        Exercise
Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $0.__ 1 , subject to adjustment
hereunder (the   Exercise Price  ). 

c)        Cashless
Exercise . If at any time there is no effective Registration Statement registering, or no current prospectus available for,
the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means
of a  cashless exercise  in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing [(A-B) times (X)] by (A), where: 

(A) =  the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which Holder elects to exercise this
Warrant by means of a  cashless exercise,  as set forth in the applicable Notice of Exercise;   

(B) =  the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and   

(X) =  the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance
with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.   

Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, on the Termination Date, this Warrant shall be automatically exercised via cashless exercise pursuant to
this Section 2(c). 

d)        Mechanics
of Exercise . 

i.        Delivery
of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Holder
by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit and Withdrawal
at Custodian system (  DWAC  ) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is
an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder
or (B) the shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, and
otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is three (3) Trading
Days after the latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise and (B) surrender of this Warrant (if required)
(such date, the   Warrant Share Delivery Date  ). The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and
Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for
all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price (or by cashless
exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2(d)(v) prior to the issuance
of such shares, having been paid. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a
Notice of Exercise by the date that is two (2) Trading Days after the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the
Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000.00 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based
on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10.00 per Trading Day (increasing to $20.00
per Trading Day on the seventh (7th) Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after two (2) Trading
Days following after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. 

__________ 

  1  One
hundred ten percent (110%) of the conversion price of the Note issued contemporaneously herewith. 

ii.        Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall
in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii.        Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)
by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right, at any time prior to issuance of such Warrant Shares,
to rescind such exercise. 

iv.        Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before
two (2) Trading Days after the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after two (2) Trading Days following such Warrant Share Delivery
Date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage
firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares that
the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a   Buy-In  ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to
the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for
the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the
Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order
giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the
Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed
rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied
with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase
price of $11,000.00 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price
giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000.00, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall
be required to pay the Holder $1,000.00. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to
the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall
limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.        No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

vi.        Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or
other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,
 however , that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant
when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company
may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The
Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise. 

vii.        Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its shareholder books or records in any manner that prevents the timely exercise of this
Warrant pursuant to the terms hereof. 

e)        Holder s
Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise
any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that, after giving effect to such issuance after
exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any other
Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock
that would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the
Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities
of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set forth in
the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company
is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder
is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained
in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by
the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of
the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this Warrant
is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this
Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to
verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by
the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request
of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to
the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date
as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The   Beneficial Ownership Limitation  
shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder may decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation at any time
and the Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company, may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase will not be effective
until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented
in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof)
which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or
supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall
apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. 

f)        Limitations
on the Number of Shares Issuable . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not issue to the Holder
any Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant to the extent such shares after giving effect to such issuance after exercise
and when added to the number of shares of Common Stock issued and issuable upon conversion of any Notes or exercise of any other
Warrants issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement would exceed (i) 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately before the date of the Purchase Agreement (the   Maximum Share Amount  ) or (ii) 19.9% of the
total voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately before the date of the Purchase Agreement that are
entitled to vote on a matter being voted on by holders of the Common Stock (the   Maximum Voting Amount  ), unless
and until the Company obtains shareholder approval permitting such issuances in accordance with applicable rules and regulations
of the NASDAQ Capital Market (  Stockholder Approval  ). For purposes of this Section 2(f), beneficial ownership
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(f), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder
may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual
report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent
written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written
or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding. If on any attempted exercise of this Warrant, the issuance of Warrant Shares would exceed
the Maximum Share Amount or the Maximum Voting Amount, and the Company shall not have previously obtained Stockholder Approval
at the time of exercise, then the Company shall issue to the Holder requesting exercise such number of Warrant Shares as may be
issued below the Maximum Share Amount or Maximum Voting Amount, as the case may be, and, with respect to the remainder of the aggregate
number of Warrant Shares, this Warrant shall not be exercisable until and unless Stockholder Approval has been obtained. 

Section 3. Certain
Adjustments . 

a)        Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination, or re  -  classification. 

b)        Subsequent
Equity Sales . If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall
sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any
offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, at an effective
price per share less than the Exercise Price then in effect (such lower price, the   Base Share Price   and such
issuances collectively, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (it being understood and agreed that if the holder of the Common
Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions,
floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices, or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued
in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is less than
the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive
Issuance at such effective price), then simultaneously with the consummation of each Dilutive Issuance the Exercise Price shall
be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased
such that the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be
equal to the aggregate Exercise Price prior to such adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments shall be made, paid, or issued under this Section 3(b)
in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the
issuance or deemed issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 3(b), indicating therein the
applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the
  Dilutive Issuance Notice  ). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance
Notice pursuant to this Section 3(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to acquire Warrant Shares
based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise.
If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction, despite the prohibition thereon in the Purchase Agreement, the Company
shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion or exercise price at
which such securities may be converted or exercised. 

c)        Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues,
or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities, or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the   Purchase Rights  ), then the Holder will be entitled to
acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired
if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to
any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as
of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights
(provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder
exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, or the issuance of such Purchase Rights would exceed the Maximum Share Amount or
the Maximum Voting Amount, the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial
ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent
shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation or the issuance of such Purchase Rights exceeding the Maximum Share Amount or the Maximum Voting
Amount). 

d)        Pro
Rata Distributions . During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other
distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital
or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock, or other securities, property or options by way of
a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a   Distribution  ),
then, in each such case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant
Register of the Company, at least 10 calendar days prior to the date as of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if
no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution, a notice stating the date as of which such record is to be taken or such determination made, and the date
as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to receive such Distribution; provided
that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate
action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material,
non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with
the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

e)        Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more
related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly
or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer, or exchange
offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell,
tender, or exchange their shares for other securities, cash, or property and has been accepted by the holders of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects
any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which
the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash, or property, or (v) the Company, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination
(including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or
group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or
affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each,
a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its
last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable effective
date of such Fundamental Transaction, a notice stating the date on which such Fundamental Transaction is expected to become effective
or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such Fundamental Transaction; provided that
the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate
action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material,
non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with
the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period
commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction triggering such notice except as may
otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

f)        Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th  of a share, as the case
may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given
date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

g)        Notice
to Holder . 

i.        Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly
mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of
Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.        Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation,
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable record or
effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution, redemption, rights, or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights, or warrants are to be determined or (y) the
date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or
close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares
of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall
not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company
shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled
to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering
such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

Section 4. Transfer
of Warrant . 

a)        Transferability .
Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) hereof and to the provisions
of Section 4.1 of the Purchase Agreement, this Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration
rights) are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated
agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder
or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender
and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue
to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company
unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company within
three (3) Trading Days of the date the Holder delivers an assignment form to the Company assigning this Warrant full. The Warrant,
if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having
a new Warrant issued. 

b)        New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer that may be involved in such division
or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the Initial Exercise Date
and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

c)        Warrant
Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the   Warrant
Register  ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and
for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

d)        Transfer
Restrictions . If, at the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant, the transfer
of this Warrant shall not be either (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions
or current public information requirements pursuant to Rule 144, the Company may require, as a condition of allowing such transfer,
that the Holder or transferee of this Warrant, as the case may be, comply with the provisions of Section 5.7 of the Purchase Agreement. 

e)        Representation
by the Holder . The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any
exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for
distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act. 

Section 5. Miscellaneous . 

a)        No
Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends, or other rights
as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly set forth in
Section 3. 

b)        Loss,
Theft, Destruction, or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that, upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and, in case of loss, theft, or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case
of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation,
in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate. 

c)        Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc.  If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or
granted herein shall not be a Trading Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Trading Day. 

d)        Authorized
Shares . The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued
Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase
rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its
officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this
Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued
as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which
the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase
rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such
Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all taxes,
liens, and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring
contemporaneously with such issue). 

Except and to the extent
as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its certificate
of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will
at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not declare a par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such
exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order
that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions, or consents from any public regulatory
body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before taking any action
that would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise Price,
the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public
regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)        Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement, and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

f)        Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered and if the Holder
does not utilize cashless exercise, will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)        Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers, or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that
all rights hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision
of this Warrant that results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be
sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those of
appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its
rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h)        Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

i)        Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

j)        Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k)        Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l)        Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. 

m)        Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant. 

n)        Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.
