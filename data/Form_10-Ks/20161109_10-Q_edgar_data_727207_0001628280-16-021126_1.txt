  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  Unaudited 

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS; BASIS OF PRESENTATION; PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION; SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. ( we  or  us  or  our  or  Accelerate  or  the Company ) is an   in vitro   diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions which improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, ( U.S. GAAP ), and applicable rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), regarding interim financial reporting.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016.  
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures such as notes required by U.S. GAAP. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the entire year ending   December 31, 2016   or any future period. 
    
  All amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise indicated. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   new entities were formed based in Europe. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents include overnight repurchase agreement accounts and other investments.  As part of our cash management process, excess operating cash is invested in overnight repurchase agreements with our bank.  Repurchase agreements and other investments classified as cash and cash equivalents are not deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Government, the FDIC or any other government agency and involve investment risk including possible loss of principal.  We believe however, that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal. 
    
  Investments 
    
  The Company invests excess funds in various investments which are primarily held in the custody of major financial institutions.  Investments consist of debt securities in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt  
  
   7 

securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper.  Management classifies its investments as available-for-sale investments and records these investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value.  The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs.  Unrealized gains or losses for available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of stockholders  equity.  The Company classifies its investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.   
    
  The Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions when an investment s fair value remains less than its cost for more than twelve months. This assessment includes a determination of whether the investment is expected to recover in value and whether the Company has the intent and ability to hold the investment until the anticipated recovery in value occurs. When an investment is identified as having an other-than-temporary impairment loss, we adjust the cost basis of the investment down to fair value resulting in a realized loss.  The new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value and temporary future increases or decreases in fair value are included in other comprehensive income  . 
    
  Reclassification 
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  The Company currently purchases and produces inventory prior to U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) or other regulatory agency approval.  We do not believe probable future economic benefit can be asserted prior to the de novo request being granted by the U.S. FDA.  Accordingly, the Company does not capitalize pre-launch inventory prior to receipt of marketing authorization, unless the regulatory review process has progressed to a point that objective and persuasive evidence of regulatory approval is sufficiently probable, and future economic benefit can be asserted.  Costs associated with the Company s purchase of inventory are either reported as research and development costs, or if the inventory is used in marketing evaluations, as sales, general and administrative costs on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  Revenue 
    
  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered.  Additional considerations include whether the applicable fee arrangement contains future delivery or performance obligations that should be divided into separate accounting units, whether the arrangement requires the Company to retain risks consistent with a collaborative arrangement, and/or whether any of the fees are contingent on the achievement of future milestones. 
    
  Deferred revenue represents amounts received but not yet earned under existing agreements. 
    
  Revenue from operations includes product sales, principally of Accelerate Pheno  systems (formerly referred to as Accelerate ID/AST systems). When an instrument is sold, revenue is generally recognized upon installation of the unit consistent with contract terms, which do not include a right of return. 
    
  Warranty  
    
  A limited warranty of less than a year is covered under selected contracts.  Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of the limited warranty repair is recorded at the time revenue is recognized.  Our estimated warranty provision is based on our estimate of future repair events and the related estimated cost of repairs.  The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of the warranty reserve and adjusts the amount as necessary.  The expense incurred for these provisions is included in sales, general and administrative on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions 
    
  The Company follows ASC 830  Foreign Currency Matters,  which provides guidance on foreign currency transactions and translation of financial statements.  Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency  
  
   8 

financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  The Company has assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.  These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in foreign currency exchange gain or loss, within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

NOTE 2.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (     FASB     ) issued Accounting Standards Update (     ASU     ) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends the guidance on measuring credit losses on financial assets (including trade accounts receivable and available for sale debt securities) held at amortized cost.  Currently, an      incurred loss      methodology is used for recognizing credit losses which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred.  The amendment requires assets valued at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected using an allowance for credit losses.  Reversal of credit losses on available for sale debt securities will be recorded in the current period net income.  The amendment will be effective for us on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted.  We do not anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements and plan to adopt on the effective date. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools.  The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting.  In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis.  The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and plan to adopt on the effective date. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  This replaces the existing standards relating to leases for both lessees and lessors.  For lessees, the new standard requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet with expenses recognized much like the existing standard.  For lessors, the new standard modifies the classification criteria and accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases and eliminates leveraged leases.  For both lessees and lessors, the standard eliminates real estate-specific provisions, changes some of the presentation and disclosure requirements, and changes sale and leaseback criteria.  The ASU is required for us on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact this will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  We are carefully evaluating our existing revenue recognition practices to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements.  The effects may include identifying performance obligations in existing arrangements, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.  We will also establish practices to determine when a performance obligation has been satisfied, and recognize revenue in accordance with the new requirements.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date resulting in a new effective date of January 1, 2018 for us.  We are permitted to adopt early but not before the original effective date of January 1, 2017.  FASB has issued several other ASU's which provide further guidance on Topic 606 and have the same effective date.  The standard allows for either  full retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements.  We are currently evaluating the transition method and the adoption date that will be elected.  We will implement ASU 2014-09 and all relevant subsequently issued ASU's on Topic 606 concurrently.

NOTE 3.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The following tables represent the financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the financial statements of the Company and the valuation approach applied to each class of financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Level 1 assets are priced using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets which include cash accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities as these specific assets are liquid. 
    
  Level 2 available-for-sale securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data.  The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets and liabilities.  The Company uses such pricing data as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its investment portfolio and has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs.  There were no transfers between levels during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 4.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK    
    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable, including receivables from major customers. 
    
  The Company s main financial institution for banking operations held   70%   and   100%   of the Company s cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company extends credit to domestic and international clients in various industries.  Exposure to losses on accounts receivable is principally dependent on each client's financial position.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $147,000   or   93%   and   $50,000   or   66%  , respectively, of the Company s outstanding receivable balance was with   one   grantor.  See   Note 7, License Agreements and Grants   for more information. 
    
  One   customer accounted for   100%   of product sales for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , while   two   customers accounted for   100%   of product sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   100%   product sales for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was with a third customer. 

NOTE 5.  INVESTMENTS 
    
  The following tables summarize the Company s available-for-sale investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company s available-for-sale securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Proceeds from sales of marketable securities (including principal paydowns), for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $7,716,000   and   $0  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $8,716,000   and   $141,000  , respectively.  The Company determines gains and losses of marketable securities based on specific identification of the securities sold.  There were   $6,000   realized gains from sales of marketable securities for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   no   gross realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The gross proceeds associated with the realized gains for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $7,204,000  .  The balance of unrealized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16,000  .    No   balances were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  No other-than-temporary impairments are recorded as no material investment had a fair value that remained less than its cost for more than twelve months as of   September 30, 2016   and there have been no other indicators of impairment.  The Company does not intend to sell investments and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell investments before recovering the amortized cost. 
    
  Additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments is included in   Note 3, Fair Value of Financial Instruments  . 

NOTE 6.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Depreciation expense (which includes amortization of capital lease assets) for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $598,000   and   $465,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,745,000   and   $1,194,000  , respectively. 

NOTE 7.  LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND GRANTS 
    
  Defense Medical Research and Development Program 
    
  In May 2012, the Company and Denver Health were notified that the Defense Medical Research and  
  
   12 

Development Program ( DMRDP ) recommended   $2.0 million   of funding for a proposed   35  -month project.  The joint proposal became the sole recipient under the Military Infectious Diseases Applied Research Award program for rapid detection of serious antibiotic-resistant infections.  The project will apply the Accelerate Pheno  system to wound infections and other serious infections secondary to trauma.  The Company has invoiced a cumulative total of   $612,000   under this grant which is recorded as an offset to research and development expenses.  The amounts invoiced for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $10,000   and   $43,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $54,000   were   $179,000  , respectively.  The period of performance for this grant was complete as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  National Institute of Health Grant 
    
  In February 2015, the National Institute of Health awarded Denver Health and the Company a   five   year,   $5.0 million   grant to develop a fast and reliable identification and categorical susceptibility test carbepenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae directly from whole blood.  The Company completed the first subaward agreement with Denver Health for services provided as part of this grant on January 31, 2016. A second subward was obtained which continued the period of performance through January 31, 2017.  The cumulative award amount under these subawards is   $818,000  .  The amounts invoiced for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $8,000   and   $467,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $67,000   and   $467,000  , respectively.  Amounts invoiced under this grant are recorded as an offset to research and development expenses.  
    
  Arizona Commerce Authority 
    
  In August 2012, the Company entered into a Grant Agreement (the  Grant Agreement ) with the Arizona Commerce Authority, an agency of the State of Arizona (the  Authority ), pursuant to which the Authority provided certain state and county sponsored incentives for the Company to relocate its corporate headquarters to, and expand its business within, the State of Arizona (the  Project ).  Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Authority agreed to provide a total grant in the amount of   $1.0 million   (the  Grant ) for the use by the Company in the advancement of the Project.  The Grant is payable out of an escrow account in   four   installments, upon the achievement of the following milestones: 

Milestone 1   Relocation of Company s operations and corporate headquarters to Arizona and creation of   15   Qualified Jobs (as defined below). 

Milestone 2   Creation of   30   Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestone 1). 

Milestone 3   Creation of   40   Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestones 1 and 2). 

Milestone 4   Creation of   65   Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestones 1, 2 and 3) and capital investment of at least   $4.5 million  . 
       
  For purposes of the Grant Agreement, a  Qualified Job  is a job that is permanent, full-time, new to Arizona, and for which the Company pays average (across all Qualified Jobs identified by the Company in its discretion) annual wages of at least   $63,000   and offers health insurance benefits and pays at least   65%   of the premiums associated with such benefits.  The amount of each installment payment will be determined in accordance with a formula specified in the Grant Agreement.  The Grant Agreement also contains other customary provisions, including representations, warranties and covenants of both parties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has collected all of the   $1.0 million   in milestones.  The full amount is recorded in long-term deferred income until the economic development provisions of the grant have been satisfied in full, as there are  claw-back  provisions which would require repayment of certain amounts received if employment levels are not sustained during the term of the arrangement.  Once the  claw-back  provisions expire in January 2018, we will recognize the grant as an offset to expense.  Further details are included in   Note 8, Deferred Revenue and Income  . 
    
  Arizona R D Refundable Tax Credit Program 
    
  The Company has applied for and met the program requirements to receive a  Certificate of Qualification  from the Arizona Commerce Authority ( Authority ), which allows the Company to be eligible for a partial refund of research and development investments ("Arizona R D Refundable Tax Credit Program").  The amounts incurred under this program are recorded as an offset to research and development expenses, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $1.2 million   and   $647,000  , respectively, and   no   amounts were incurred for the  
  
   13 

three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The refund for the 2014 and 2015 tax years is collected. If the amount received for this program is later determined to be incorrect or invalid, the excess may need to be repaid. 

NOTE 8.  DEFERRED REVENUE AND INCOME 
    
  Deferred revenue consists of amounts received for products or services not yet delivered or earned.  Deferred income consists of amounts received for commitments not yet fulfilled.  If we anticipate that the revenue or income will not be earned within the following twelve months, the amount is reported as long-term deferred income.  A summary of the balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   follows: 

We have received   $1.0 million   in milestone payments from the Arizona Commerce Authority under the Grant Agreement described in   Note 7, License Agreements and Grants  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , no such payments have been recognized in income, and we do not anticipate recognizing such payments as income until the  claw-back  provisions under the Grant Agreement expire in January 2018.

  Legal Matters 
    
  On March 19, 2015, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Lawrence Mehren, and Steve Reichling, Rapp v. Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., et al., U.S. District Court, District of Arizona, 2:2015-cv-00504.  The complaint alleges that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making false or misleading statements about our Accelerate Pheno  system, formerly called the BACcel System.  Plaintiff purports to bring the action on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our stock between March 7, 2014 and February 17, 2015.  On June 9, 2015, Julia Chang was appointed Lead Plaintiff of the purported class.  On June 23, 2015, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b- 5, by making false or misleading statements or omissions about our ID/AST System and by allegedly employing schemes to defraud.  Plaintiff sought certification of the action as a class action, compensatory damages for the class in an unspecified amount, legal fees and costs, and such other relief as the court may order.  Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on July 21, 2015.  The Court granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on January 28, 2016.  On February 26, 2016, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which challenges the dismissal of the amended complaint.  Chang v. Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., et al., No. 2:15-CV-00504-SPL (9th Cir. filed Feb. 26, 2016).  The appeal has been fully briefed and is pending. 
   
  NOTE 13.  SEGMENTS 
    
  The Company operates as   one   operating segment.  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance.  The Company s business operates in   one   operating segment because the Company s chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company s financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis.  Since the Company operates in   one   operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 14.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Overview 
    
  Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections.  Microbiology laboratories are in need of new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of our time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise of resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by a lack of timely diagnostic results.  The delay of these results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories on traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to complete. Our technology platform is built to address these challenges by delivering significantly faster and accurate testing of infectious pathogens in various patient sample types. 
    
  Since 2004, we have focused our efforts on the development of an innovative rapid diagnostic platform, the Accelerate Pheno  system, intended for the rapid diagnosis of infectious pathogens.  Our goal is to reduce the failure rate of initial antibiotic drug therapy by shortening lab turnaround time to hours rather than the two to three days now required to deliver identification and susceptibility results. 
    
  The ID/AST System utilizes genotypic technology to identify, or ID, infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing, or AST, which determines whether live bacterial or fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic.  The ID/AST blood culture assay kit, which we refer to as the Accelerate PhenoTest  BC Kit, is being investigated for its ability to provide ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk.  The Accelerate PhenoTest  BC Kit is a highly multiplexed panel targeting 140 individual assays which have the potential to support clinicians in prescribing optimal antibiotic therapy for patients in this critical condition.  The final number of assays included in the Accelerate PhenoTest  BC Kit will depend on the results of FDA s review of each individual assay for marketing clearance.  This panel is designed to cover over 80% of the routine and significant pathogens causing blood stream infections and over 90% of the antibiotics useful in treating those pathogens.   
    
  On June 30, 2015, we declared our conformity to the European In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79 EC and applied a CE Mark to the Accelerate Pheno  system and the Accelerate PhenoTest  BC Kit for in vitro diagnostic use.  On July 11, 2016 Accelerate submitted to the FDA a De Novo request for pre market authorization of its Accelerate Pheno  system and Accelerate PhenoTest  BC Kit based on a clinical study representing over 1,800 samples across 13 sites.  We anticipate commercializing the Accelerate Pheno  system in the United States, subject to clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).  We expect to have a decision no later than the first quarter of 2017, or as early as the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Changes in Results of Operations:   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , total revenues were   $24,000   as compared to   $92,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $68,000   or   74%  .  The decrease was due to sales of Accelerate Pheno  systems (Research Use Only) during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The Company does not currently capitalize pre-launch inventory and the cost of product sales is reported as research and development costs on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  Research and development expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $7,531,000   as compared to   $6,499,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $1,032,000   or   16%  .  The increase was primarily the result of increasing employee headcount, clinical trial fees, and increased purchases of laboratory and instrument engineering supplies to support research and development as well as pre-launch efforts.  Research and development expenses include non-cash equity-based compensation for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $504,000   and   $406,000  , respectively, which increased   $98,000  .  We do not capitalize our inventory prior to FDA approval in accordance with U.S. GAAP, accordingly instruments and consumables charged to research and development were   $795,000   and   $235,000   for   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , sales, general and administrative expenses were   $9,308,000   as compared to   $4,332,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $4,976,000   or   115%  .  The increase was primarily driven by salaries and related expenses as we ramp up our sales and marketing operations globally.  Sales, general and administrative expenses include non-cash equity-based compensation for the  
  
   19 

three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $2,166,000   and   $1,404,000  , respectively, which increased   $762,000  .  We do not capitalize our internally developed instruments prior to FDA approval in accordance with U.S. GAAP at which time we believe the costs will be recoverable and, therefore, sales, general and administrative expenses include performance verification program and demonstration instruments as expense totaling   $1,181,000   and   $31,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Depreciation for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $598,000   as compared to   $465,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $133,000   or   29%  .  The increased depreciation was the result of purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements to support the Company s Tucson facility laboratory, manufacturing and administrative space. 
    
  As a result of the above factors, loss from operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $17,416,000   as compared to the loss of   $11,207,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase in loss from operations of   $6,209,000   or   55%  . Loss from operations include non-cash equity-based compensation for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $2,670,000   and   $1,810,000  , respectively, which increased   $860,000  .  This loss and further losses are anticipated and was the result of our continued investments in research and development, expanded laboratory and operational space, increased employee headcount and other factors as we develop and commercialize the Company s products. 
    
  Other non-operating income during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $117,000   as compared to   $21,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $96,000   or   457%  .  This change was due to an increase in investment income. 
    
  As a result of these factors, net loss for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $17,299,000   as compared to a net loss of   $11,186,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase in net loss of   $6,113,000   or   55%  . 
    
  Unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $70,000   as compared to   $1,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Foreign currency translation adjustment loss for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $8,000   as compared to   $2,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The resulting comprehensive losses were   $17,377,000   and   $11,189,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The increase was due to sales of Accelerate Pheno  systems (Research Use Only) during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The Company does not currently capitalize pre-launch inventory and the cost of product sales is reported as research and development costs on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  Research and development expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $22,948,000   as compared to   $19,356,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $3,592,000   or   19%  .  The increase was primarily the result of increasing employee headcount, clinical trial fees, and increased purchases of laboratory and instrument engineering supplies to support research and development as well as pre-launch efforts.  Research and development expenses include non-cash equity-based compensation for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $1,168,000   and   $1,842,000  , respectively, which decreased   $674,000  .  We do not capitalize our inventory prior to FDA approval in accordance with U.S. GAAP, accordingly instruments and consumables charged to research and development were   $3,897,000   and   $2,446,000   for   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , sales, general and administrative expenses were   $25,983,000   as compared to   $11,953,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $14,030,000   or   117%  .  The increase was primarily driven by salaries and related expenses as we ramp up our sales

We do not capitalize our internally developed instruments prior to FDA approval in accordance with U.S. GAAP at which time we believe the costs will be recoverable and, therefore, sales, general and administrative expenses include performance verification program and demonstration instruments as expense totaling   $2,517,000   and   $360,000   for   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Depreciation for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1,745,000   as compared to   $1,194,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $551,000   or   46%  .  The increased depreciation was the result of purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements to support the Company s Tucson facility laboratory, manufacturing and administrative space. 
    
  As a result of the above factors, loss from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $50,477,000   as compared to the loss of   $32,386,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase in loss from operations of   $18,091,000   or   56%  .

This loss and further losses are anticipated and was the result of our continued investments in research and development, expanded laboratory and operational space, increased employee headcount and other factors as we develop and commercialize the Company s products. 
    
  Other non-operating income during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $238,000   as compared to   $51,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $187,000   or   367%  .  This change was due to an increase in investment income. 
    
  As a result of these factors, net loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $50,239,000   as compared to a net loss of   $32,335,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase in net loss of   $17,904,000   or   55%  .

  Foreign currency translation adjustment loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $8,000   as compared to   $2,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The resulting comprehensive losses were   $50,236,000   and   $32,341,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity has been from sales of shares of common stock.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $90.2 million   in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, a decrease of   $42.3 million   from   $132.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The primary reason for the change in these assets was the funding of operational losses. 
    
  The Company is subject to a Lease Agreement with Pima County of Arizona.  The future minimum lease payments under the Lease Agreement are included in   Item 1, Note 12, Commitments  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that current cash balances will be more than sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the next twelve months. 

21 

The following summarizes selected items in the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

The net cash used in operating activities was   $40.6 million   and   $25.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was primarily comprised of the net loss from the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  The net cash used in investing activities was   $52.2 million   and   $3.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was primarily comprised of purchases of available-for-sale investments, offset by the maturity of other available-for-sale investments during such periods. 
    
  The net cash provided by financing activities was   $983,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  This is primarily comprised of proceeds received from the recovery of related party short swing profits and exercised options and warrants; which were partially offset by stock issuance costs paid in the period for the prior year issuance of common stock.  The net cash provided by financing activities was   $432,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and was primarily comprised of exercised options. 
    
  Our primary use of capital has been for the continued development and investment in commercialization readiness of the Accelerate Pheno  system.  We believe our capital requirements will continue to be met with our existing cash balance and those provided under grants, exercises of warrants and stock options and/or, additional issuance of equity or debt securities.  However, if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional capital sooner than expected.  There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current common stockholders. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates.  We have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would change the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments by approximately   $477,000  . 
  Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.  We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.  The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments.  We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk.  To achieve our goals, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities that management believes to be of high credit quality.  Further information regarding our investments is included in   Item 1, Note 5, Investments  . 
  
   22 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  On March 19, 2015, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Lawrence Mehren, and Steve Reichling, Rapp v. Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., et al., U.S. District Court, District of Arizona, 2:2015-cv-00504.  The complaint alleges that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making false or misleading statements about our ID/AST System, formerly called the BACcel System.  Plaintiff purports to bring the action on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our stock between March 7, 2014 and February 17, 2015.  On June 9, 2015, Julia Chang was appointed Lead Plaintiff of the purported class.  On June 23, 2015, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b- 5, by making false or misleading statements or omissions about our ID/AST System and by allegedly employing schemes to defraud.  Plaintiff sought certification of the action as a class action, compensatory damages for the class in an unspecified amount, legal fees and costs, and such other relief as the court may order.  Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on July 21, 2015.  The Court granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on January 28, 2016.  On February 26, 2016, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which challenges the dismissal of the amended complaint.  Chang v. Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., et al., No. 2:15-CV-00504-SPL (9th Cir. filed Feb. 26, 2016).  The appeal has been fully briefed and is pending.
