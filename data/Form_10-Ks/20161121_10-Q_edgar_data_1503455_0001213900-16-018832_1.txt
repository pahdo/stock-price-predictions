BCI
Holding, Inc.   

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   FOR
THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 and 2015   

NOTE
1    ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   

BCI
Holding, Inc. (former Asset Protection of America, Inc.) ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our )
was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 27, 2010. Prior to March 28, 2014, the Company s name was Bauman Estate
Planning, Inc. The Company engages in the business of estate planning. The Company is a one-stop, full service estate planning
and an asset protection company. The Company s staff of professional, dedicated, experienced, knowledgeable and highly competent
personnel are trained and licensed to offer a broad range of estate planning services. The Company can assist their customers
from minimizing or eliminating probate and/or federal estate taxes to highly sophisticated estate planning tools. The Company s
fiscal year is December 31. On August 31, 2016 the Registrant changed the name of the Registrant from Asset Protection of America,
Inc. to BCI Holding Inc.  

In July 2016, the prior sole shareholder of the Company, Todd Bauman ( seller ), entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement with Max Niche Saint Solution PTE LTD ( purchaser ). The seller sold all his shares
to the purchaser, closing on August 2, 2016 ( the closing date ) and all assets and liabilities before August 2, 2016
were assumed by the seller. As of August 2, 2016, the Company s estate planning business will not be relevant to the Company s
future business.  

Since
July 1, 2016, the Company does not have any business operations.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. While the Company has started to achieve
a profitable business, it has yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability where revenue consistently exceeds its operating expenses
and it does not currently have the funding to fully implement its business plan. Future losses are anticipated in the continued
development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
or stockholders or through debt or equity financings.  

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentations   

The
Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP 
accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit in accordance with SEC rules for quarterly reports
on form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015
audited financial statements. The results of operations for period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results for the full years.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related
to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates
and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and
the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ
materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual
results, future results of operations will be affected.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on deposit in overnight deposit accounts and investments in money market accounts. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $0 and $0 cash and cash equivalents.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability
based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. The Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Financial
Instruments   

ASC
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair
value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements.  Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a
definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs.  ASC
820 defines the hierarchy as follows:  

Level
1   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  

Level
2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of
the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities
or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs.  

Level
3   Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date.  The types of assets and liabilities
included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective
models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.  

Our
financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and advances, related party which approximate their
fair value due to their short maturities.  

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed
assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Cost represents the purchase price of the
asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over
the assets  estimated useful lives. The useful lives of the assets are as follows office equipment 3 years and leasehold improvements
use the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the agreements, generally ranging from 3 to 15 years. Additions
and improvements are capitalized while routine repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or disposition,
the historically recorded asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount less proceeds
from disposal is charged or credited to other income / expense.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

We
account for our long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. We assess recoverability
of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual
disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal
to the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair value or disposable value.  

Income
Taxes   

Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely that not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed, services are rendered, and there is reasonable
assurance of collection.  

Advertising,
Promotion and Marketing   

We
recognize advertising, promotion and marketing costs as incurred. The amount of advertising, promotion and marketing expense recognized
for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively. The amount of advertising, promotion
and marketing expense recognized for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share   

The
Company computes income loss per share in accordance with  ASC-260 ,  Earnings per Share  which requires
presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic income loss per share
is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares
during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

No
potential dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of its operations.  

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while
maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this
Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred
tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by
the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application
is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process
of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company s
financial statements would be insignificant.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows . The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or
Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made
after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned
Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees;
(8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance
Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should
be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively
for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory ,
which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when
the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under
Common Control . The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate
a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change
the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting
entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related
parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

NOTE
4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

In
support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties which mainly consisted
of directors and officers of the company until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing
through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders.
 Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature
and have not been formalized by a promissory note.    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the CEO of the Company, Mr. Jean Yves Gicque, was repaid $0 and $0 and advanced
to the Company $3,500 and $0, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances on the advances were $3,500 and $0, respectively. The advances are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and due on demand.  

NOTE
5   COMMON STOCK   

The
Company is authorized by its Article of Incorporation and Bylaws to issue up to 75,000,000 Common Stock.  

As
at September 30, 2016, there were 11,548,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  

NOTE
6   DISCONTINUED OPERATION   

In July 2016, the prior sole shareholder
of the Company, Todd Bauman ( seller ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Max Niche Saint Solution
PTE LTD ( purchaser ). The seller sold all his shares to the purchaser, closing on August 2, 2016 ( the closing
date ) and all assets and liabilities before August 2, 2016 were assumed by the seller. As of August 2, 2016, the Company s
estate planning business will not be relevant to the Company s future business. 

Since July 1, 2016, the Company does
not have any business operations. 

The
Company s results of operations related to discontinued operation have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a
retrospective basis for all periods presented.  

Balances
for discontinued operation as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

The
operating results of discontinued operation for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 classified as discontinued
operations are summarized below:  

NOTE 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

  In November 2016, t he
board of directors adopted a resolution and authorized the Company to increase the authorized shares of common stock from
75,000,000 shares to 5,000,000,000. Par value remains $0.001 per share. The Company is in the process of getting approval
from FINRA.  

 Management has evaluated subsequent events through November 21,

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This
Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical
facts, included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q which address activities, events or developments which the Company
expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount
and nature thereof); finding suitable merger or acquisition candidates; expansion and growth of the Company s business and operations;
and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by
the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments,
as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results or developments
will conform with the Company s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general
economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by
the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company.   

These
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as  believes, 
 anticipates,   expects,   estimates,   plans,   may,   will,  or
similar terms. These statements appear in a number of places in this Filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief
or current expectations of the Company, and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting
the Company s financial condition or results of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company s business and growth strategies;
and, (iii) the Company s financing plans. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors that could adversely affect actual results
and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company s limited operating history, potential fluctuations in quarterly
operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition.   

Consequently,
all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no
assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized,
that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no
obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.   

The
Company has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the Company, its current business and its prospects can be
based. The Company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered
by companies in their early stages of development. Such risks include inadequate funding the company s inability to anticipate
and adapt to a developing market, the failure of the company s infrastructure, changes in laws that adversely affect the company s
business, the ability of the Company to manage its operations, including the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other
costs relating to the expansion of the company s operations, the introduction and development of different or more extensive communities
by direct and indirect competitors of the Company, including those with greater financial, technical and marketing resources,
the inability of the Company to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel and general economic conditions.   

The
Company expects that its operating expenses will increase significantly, especially as it implements its business plan. To the
extent that increases in its operating expenses precede or are not followed by commensurate increases in revenues, or that the
Company is unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly, the Company s business, results of operations and financial
condition would be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurances that the Company can achieve or sustain profitability
or that the Company s operating losses will not increase in the future.   

GENERAL
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

BCI
Holding, Inc. (former Asset Protection of America, Inc.) ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our )
was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 27, 2010. Prior to March 28, 2014, the Company s name was Bauman Estate
Planning, Inc. The Company engages in the business of estate planning. The Company is a one-stop, full service estate planning
and an asset protection company. The Company s staff of professional, dedicated, experienced, knowledgeable and highly competent
personnel are trained and licensed to offer a broad range of estate planning services. The Company can assist their customers
from minimizing or eliminating probate and/or federal estate taxes to highly sophisticated estate planning tools. The Company s
fiscal year is December 31. On August 31, 2016 the Registrant changed the name of the Registrant from Asset Protection of America,
Inc. to BCI Holding Inc.  

DISCONTINUED
OPERATION   

In July 2016, the prior sole shareholder
of the Company, Todd Bauman ( seller ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Max Niche Saint Solution
PTE LTD ( purchaser ). The seller sold all his shares to the purchaser, closing on August 2, 2016 ( the closing
date ) and all assets and liabilities before August 2, 2016 were assumed by the seller. As of August 2, 2016, the Company s
estate planning business will not be relevant to the Company s future business. 

Since July 1, 2016, the Company does
not have any business operations. 

The Company s results of operations
related to discontinued operation have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. 

Balances
for discontinued operation as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

The
operating results of discontinued operation for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 classified as discontinued
operations are summarized below:  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.   

Service
Revenue   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $0 and $0 in service revenues, respectively.  

Cost
of Revenue   

Our
cost of revenue was $0 and $0, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Operating
Expenses   

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $3,750 and $0 in operating expenses, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, our operating expenses consisted of $0 and $0 in advertising and marketing expenses, and consisted of $3,500 and $0 in
professional fees, respectively. 

Net
Loss   

Our net loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $3,750 compared to net loss of $66,788 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a variance of $63,038
due to discontinued operation discussed above. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.   

Service
Revenue   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $0 and $0 in service revenues, respectively.  

Cost
of Revenue   

Our
cost of revenue was $0 and $0, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Operating
Expenses   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $3,750 and $0 in operating expenses, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, our operating expenses consisted of $0 and $0 in advertising and marketing expenses, and consisted of $3,500 and $0 in
professional fees, respectively.   

Net
Loss   

Our net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $10,998 compared to net loss of $77,156 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a variance of $66,158
due to discontinued operation discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $0 in current assets compared to $6,119 at December 31, 2015. Current liabilities at September 30,
2016 totaled $3,500 compared to $59,420 at December 31, 2015.  

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. While the Company has started to achieve
a profitable business, it has yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability where revenue consistently exceeds its operating expenses
and it does not currently have the funding to fully implement its business plan. Future losses are anticipated in the continued
development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
or stockholders or through debt or equity financings.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities    

For
the period ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $3,500 compared to $74,619 used in operating
activities for the period ended September 30 , , 2015, a decrease of $71,119. During the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, the Company generated losses of $3,500.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities    

We
had no investing activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $3,500 advances from a related party compared to $50,000 promissory
note issued to unrelated party during nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

In
Financial Reporting release No. 60,  CAUTIONARY ADVICE REGARDING DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ( FRR
60 ), the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their
most critical accounting policies. In FRR 60, the SEC defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most
important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most difficult
and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this
definition, our most critical accounting policies include: non-cash compensation valuation that affects the total expenses reported
in the current period and the valuation of shares. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying these most critical
accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

a  smaller reporting  company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation  S-K, the Company is not required to provide
information required by this Item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our president (also our principal executive officer) and our secretary, treasurer and chief financial
officer (also our principal financial and accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (also our
principal executive officer and our chief financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance in the reliability of our corporate reporting as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report due to certain deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal
controls over financial reporting and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.  

There
was no change in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during our last fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
