NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of presentation   

  The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  

These
statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary
for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these interim condensed consolidated financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes
thereto included in the Company s 10-K annual report and all amendments. The Company follows the same accounting policies
in the preparation of interim reports.  

Results
of operations for the interim period are not indicative of annual results.  

Principles
of consolidation   

  The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Citadel Exploration, Inc., Citadel Exploration, LLC and Citadel
Kern Bluff, LLC, the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated. Citadel Exploration, Inc., Citadel Exploration, LLC and Citadel Kern Bluff, LLC will be collectively referred
herein to as the  Company .  

Nature
of operations   

  Currently,
the Company is focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties in California.    

Revenue
Recognition   

  Sales
of oil are recognized when the product has been delivered to a custody transfer point, persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement exists, the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery, collection of revenue
from the sale is reasonably assured, and the sales price is fixed or determinable.  

Impairment   

  The
Company evaluates the impairment of its proved oil and natural gas properties on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying values of proved properties are reduced
to fair value when the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than net book value. The fair values of proved properties
are measured using valuation techniques consistent with the income approach, converting future cash flows to a single discounted
amount. Significant inputs used to determine the fair values of proved properties include estimates of: (i) reserves; (ii) future
operating and development costs; (iii) future commodity prices; and (iv) a market-based weighted average cost of capital
rate.

Financial Statements  

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Use
of estimates   

  The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  

Fair
value of financial instruments    

  The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, due to shareholders/related parties and accounts
and other payables approximate their fair values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these instruments. It is management s
opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, price or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents    

  The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
The Company had no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Earnings
per share    

  The
Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) calculations
are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive
they are not considered in the computation.  

Recent
pronouncements   

  The
Company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements through September 30, 2016 and believes that none of them will have
a material effect on the company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged substantially in financing activities and developing its
business plan and incurring startup costs and expenses. As a result, the Company incurred an accumulated deficit in the
amount of $8,211,898 as of September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company s development activities since inception have
been financially sustained through debt and equity financing.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale
of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview   

Citadel
is an energy company engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties. Our properties are located
in the San Joaquin Basin of California. Subject to availability of capital, we strive to implement an accelerated development
program utilizing capital resources, a regional operating focus, an experienced management and technical team, and enhanced recovery
technologies to attempt to increase production and increase returns for our stockholders. Our corporate strategy is to build value
in the Company through the acquisition of oil and gas leases with significant upside potential, successful exploration and exploitation
and the efficient development of these assets.  

Our
revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and our ability to
find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.  

Our
Operations   

  Our
principal strategy is to focus on the acquisition of oil and natural gas mineral leases that have known hydrocarbons or are in
close proximity to known hydrocarbons that have been underdeveloped. Once acquired, we strive to implement an accelerated development
program utilizing capital resources, a regional operating focus, an experienced management and technical team, and enhanced recovery
technologies to attempt to increase production and increase returns for our stockholders. Our oil and natural gas acquisition
and development activities are currently focused in the State of California.   

  In
December of 2014, Citadel began a work-over on the Yowlumne #2-26 well including installation of a new pump in February of 2015.
The well has been producing approximately 20- 25 barrels per day (32 degree API quality) since the beginning of March. In June
the well s pump had a mechanical issue, the company performed well maintenance in August returning the well to its previous
production level. During December of 2015, extremely cold weather forced the shut-down of the #2-26 well. Citadel plans to return
the well to production in the fourth quarter of 2016. Citadel is in the final stages of the CEQA process to permit two additional
exploration wells on the Yowlumne acreage. Recent regulatory changes, including SB4 the State of California s bill on fracking
have delayed the final approval of our CEQA application. As such we do not expect to have these prospects permitted until the
end of 2016, at which time we will determine when to drill. Both of these exploration wells will be targeting the Stephens Sands
at a depth of 12,000 to 15,000 feet. Citadel currently has a 75% working interest in these exploration prospects and is the operator.  

On
July 31, 2015 Citadel acquired approximately 1,100 acres of leases, production facilities and equipment that encompassed the
Kern Bluff Oil Field. As consideration for this acquisition Citadel issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock and paid
$2,000,000 in cash. The transaction was financed via a $3,500,000 one year term loan from Cibolo Creek Partners, of Midland
Texas. In March of 2016, Cibolo Creek Partners converted the $3,500,000 term loan into Series A Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock.  

In
December of 2015, Citadel shifted its CAPEX focus to remediation of the existing acquired facilities. At the time of purchase,
the oil at Kern Bluff was being processed by temporary facilities installed by the previous owner. As production increased in
September, it quickly became apparent that these facilities were not capable of processing the additional volumes of oil and water
being produced. The existing permanent facilities were built in the 1970 s by Gulf Oil and require extensive remediation
including new pipe, valves, flanges and tank repair. In order to facilitate the remediation, Citadel elected to shut down the
eight producing wells in early January.

       Table of Contents   

In
June of 2016, Citadel completed its facility upgrades; the new facilities have production capacity of 500-700 BOPD. Citadel drilled
three wells in June and returned to production 9 idle wells. Production from the new wells continues to increase as the wells
clean up. As of November 15, 2016 the Company was producing 50 to 75 barrels of oil per day. The Company is currently working
on purchasing and or renting a steam generator, to begin cyclic steaming operations in the 4 th  quarter of 2016. The
Company believes that cyclic steaming of the existing wells, should double its current production.  

Going
Concern   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of the Company as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company is in the exploration stage
and, accordingly, has not generated revenues from operations. As shown on the accompanying  condensed consolidated
financial statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit in the amount of$8,211,898 and has a bank overdraft of
$9,701 as of September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. 

The
future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development
of its oil and gas business opportunities.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 we generated $50,735 from the sale of oil. During the nine month period ended
September 30, 2015 we generated $80,428 from the sale of oil. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced production during
the 2016 facility upgrades.  

Operating
expenses totaled $1,219,454 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 which was an decrease over the period
ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses consisted of lease operating expense, general and administrative costs,
amortization and depreciation, professional fees, executive compensation, and dryhole/abandonment. The decrease consisted
primarily of a decrease in dry hole/abandonment expense, while general and administrative costs increased. During the period
ended September 30, 2015 the Company's operating expense totaled $2,483,904.  

General
and administrative fees increased from $244,799 to $456,768 from the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to insurance, marketing and meals and entertainment expenses.  

Professional
fees increased from $44,749 to $176,928 from the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to the nine month period ended September
30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to services provided to the Company for accounting, consulting and legal.  

Executive
compensation decreased from $641,430 to $386,289 from the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the stock options that fully vested in 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Company has established a capital budget for 2016 of $4,000,000 to complete facility remediation, return to production up to 20
wells and drill up to 5 vertical wells and 1 horizontal well. Given the current state of depressed oil prices, the Company s
ability to complete this capital budget will be highly dependent on higher oil prices and access to capital.

       Table of Contents   

As of September
30, 2016, the Company had $73,076 of current assets and a bank overdraft of $9,701. The following table provides detailed
information about the net cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 as presented in this
quarterly report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings from related parties
and an unrelated third party. 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Operating
activities    

The
net loss in the period was greater than the non-cash adjustments to reconcile the changes in the balance sheet and statement of
operations, which is the reason cash used in operating activities was negative.  

Investing
activities    

The
net cash used in investing activities consisted of drilling expenses and facility upgrades on oil and gas properties of
$1,950,614 on the Company s properties.  

Financing
activities    

The
net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the preferred stock offering, net of offering costs, totaling
$1,955,000, a note payable totaling 68,736 and note repayments totaling $52,020.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing as well as through the issuance of stock to
provide the capital we need to run our business.  

Without
cash flow from operations we will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet
our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We will require additional cash resources
due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy to successfully develop our Kern Bluff Oil Field, exploration
drilling at Yowlumne and or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources and then current cash-flows from
operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain
a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could
restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand
our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

       Table of Contents   

Our
ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing, and Joint Venture or Working Interest partnerships
will also be important to our expansion plans. In the event we experience any significant problems assimilating acquired assets
into our operations or cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to reduce the growth of our
operations. This may materially impact our ability to increase revenue and develop our assets.  

Contractual
Obligations   

An
operating lease for rental office space was entered into beginning March 1, 2013 for two years at $2,150 per month. The original
lease was amended to include additional space at a price of $1,100 per month for the same term.  The original term of the
lease expired on March 1, 2015. As such our office lease is now on a month to month basis at a rate of $3,000 per month.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of the date of this report, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  

Operation
Plan   

Our
plan is to focus on the acquisition and drilling of prospective oil and natural gas mineral leases. Once we have tested a
prospect as productive, subject to availability of capital, we will implement a development program with a regional operating
focus in order to increase production and increase returns for our stockholders. Exploration, acquisition and development
activities are currently focused in California. Depending on availability of capital, and other constraints, our  goal
is to increase stockholder value by finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at costs that provide an attractive
rate of return on our investments. 

We
expect to achieve these results by:  

Investing
    capital in exploration and development drilling and in secondary and tertiary recovery of oil as well as natural gas;   

Using
    the latest technologies available to the oil and natural gas industry in our operations;   

Finding
    additional oil and natural gas reserves on the properties we acquire.   

In
addition to raising additional capital we plan to take on Joint Venture (JV) or Working Interest (WI) partners who may contribute
to the capital costs of drilling and completion and then share in revenues derived from production. This economic strategy may
allow us to utilize our own financial assets toward the growth of our leased acreage holdings, pursue the acquisition of strategic
oil and gas producing properties or companies and generally expand our existing operations.  

Our
future financial results will depend primarily on: (i) the ability to continue to source and screen potential projects; (ii) the
ability to discover commercial quantities of natural gas and oil; (iii) the market price for oil and natural gas; and (iv) the
ability to fully implement our exploration and development program, which is dependent on the availability of capital resources.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects, that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the
time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production, or that we will be able to obtain additional funding
to increase our currently limited capital resources.

4T. Controls and Procedures   

    Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Armen Nahabedian, and our Chief Financial Officer, Philip McPherson evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation and assessment, Mr. Armen Nahabedian and Mr. Philip McPherson concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures     

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business. We received notice on or about July 10, 2013 that the Center for Biological Diversity ( CBD )
had filed a law suit against the County of San Benito regarding the approval of Project Indian which is described more fully,
above, as the  Case . The Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 in favor of our application to drill 15 exploration wells
on our Project Indian lease. The Court approved the petition in a judgment entered on September 4, 2014, and ruled that Citadel
was required to obtain an environmental impact report before commencing Project Indian. Thereafter, the Court awarded the petitioner
$347,969 as attorney s fees and costs against the County of San Benito and Citadel, jointly and severally. The Company has
requested a dismissal of its appeal of this decision which was granted as the Court required the Company to post a bond in which
it was unable to qualify for. In October of 2015, the company paid $92,693 to the Center for Biological Diversity for a share
of the attorney s fees and costs outstanding which satisfied the judgment for attorney s fees and costs in full. In
October of 2015, the company entered into a summary judgement with the County of San Benito to pay $262,500 in related costs of
the CBD litigation. The company is required to pay $25,000 per quarter for the next six quarters and a lump sum payment of the
remaining balance in the first quarter of 2018. This puts to an end any future costs associated litigation regarding Project Indian
in San Benito County.    

On
November 4, 2014 voters in the County of San Benito passed Measure J which bans hydraulic fracturing and other stimulation techniques
defined as  high intensity petroleum operations  by the Measure, including steam injection. The initiative was passed
by a count of 8,034 to 5,605. In advance of the initiative passing, the County preemptively passed an ordinance allowing for exemptions
from the application of the Measure in the event the Measure would result in a taking. A regulatory taking is a situation in which
a government regulation limits the uses of private property to such a degree that the regulation effectively deprives the property
owners of economically reasonable use or value of their property right to such an extent that it deprives them of utility or value
of that property right, even though the regulation does not formally divest them of title to it. Accordingly, Citadel Exploration
Inc. will provide the County of San Benito the ability to compensate the company for the diminished value at the Indian Oil Field
based on the reasonable Unrisked Resource Potential the property would ultimately yield, or allow Citadel to proceed with full
field development and steam injection under the exemption ordinance.  At this time Citadel has reserved its rights, with
respect to the Indian Oil Field, including claims for inverse condemnation.

services performed in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

In
March of 2015, the Company approved the issuance of 1,400,000 common stock shares and issued 25,000 shares recorded as a stock
payable at December 31, 2014, for the conversion of a $100,000 promissory note, plus accrued interest of $2,164 and an additional

In
July of 2015, the Company approved the issuance of 6,000,000 common stock shares as partial consideration for the purchase of
the Kern Bluff Oil Field.  

In
March of 2016, the Company approved the issuance of up to 250,000 Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. The
Series A Participating Preferred Stock has a 3 year term, with a 10% coupon. Each share of Series A converts into 100 shares
of the Company s common stock, equaling a conversion price of $0.20 a share. Additionally the Series A Participating
Preferred Stock has a 2% overriding royalty (ORRI) on the Kern Bluff Oil Field, until conversion, at which time the ORRI is
reduced to 1% in perpetuity. The company issued 38,750 shares to investors for cash proceeds of $775,000. Additionally the
Company converted the $3,500,000 term loan with Cibolo Creek Partners into 175,000 shares of Series A Participating Preferred
Stock. Cibolo Creek also subscribed for an additional 5,000 shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock for cash
proceeds of $100,000.  

In
June of 2016, the Company issued 50,000 shares to investors for cash proceeds of $1,000,000.

stock for cash in the amount of $100,000.  

We
believe that the issuance and sale of the above securities were exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of Section 4(2), Regulation D and/or Regulation S. The securities were issued directly
by us and did not involve a public offering or general solicitation. The recipient of the securities was afforded an opportunity
for effective access to files and records of our company that contained the relevant information needed to make her investment
decision, including our financial statements and 34 Act reports. We reasonably believed that the recipient, immediately prior
to issuing the securities, had such knowledge and experience in our financial and business matters that she was capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its investment. The recipient had the opportunity to speak with our management on several occasions prior
to her investment decision. There were no commissions paid on the issuance and sale of the shares.

    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
    over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
