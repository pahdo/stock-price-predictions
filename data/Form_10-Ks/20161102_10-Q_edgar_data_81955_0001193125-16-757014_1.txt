    Notes to the Consolidated Schedule of Portfolio Investments    

(a) 
 At September 30, 2016, restricted securities represented 100% of the fair value of the investment portfolio. Restricted securities are subject to one or more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable.

(b) 
 The Date Acquired column indicates the year in which the Corporation first acquired an investment in the company or a predecessor company.    

(c) 
 Each equity percentage estimates the Corporation s ownership interest in the applicable portfolio investment. The estimated ownership is calculated based on the percent of outstanding voting securities held by the
Corporation or the potential percentage of voting securities held by the Corporation upon exercise of warrants or conversion of debentures, or other available data. If applicable, the symbol   1%  indicates that the Corporation holds an
equity interest of less than one percent.    

(d) 
 The Corporation s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  which defines fair value and establishes
guidelines for measuring fair value. At September 30, 2016, ASC 820 designates 100% of the Corporation s investments as  Level 3  assets. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly held securities are
valued at the average closing bid price for these securities for the last three trading days of the month. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale, and are valued at fair value as determined by the management of the Corporation
and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. Fair value is considered to be the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of any particular date,
however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in
determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the investment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of
the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have an impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 3  Investments  to the Consolidated Financial Statements).    

(e) 
 These investments are non-income producing. All other investments are income producing. Non-income producing investments have not generated cash payments of interest or dividends including LLC tax-related distributions
within the last twelve months, or are not expected to do so going forward.    

(f) 
 As of September 30, 2016, the total cost of investment securities was approximately $32.3 million. Net unrealized depreciation was approximately ($4.7) million, which was comprised of $1.4 million of unrealized
appreciation of investment securities and ($6.1) million of unrealized depreciation of investment securities. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was $1.7 million and the aggregate gross
unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was ($5.8) million. The net unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was $4.1 million based on a tax cost of $31.7 million.    

(g) 
 Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. investment.    

(h) 
 Reduction in cost and value from previously reported balances reflects current principal repayment. There were no principal repayments during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    

(i) 
 Represents interest due (amounts over $50,000 net of reserves) from investment included as interest receivable on the Corporation s Statement of Financial Position.    

(j) 
 Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.    

(k) 
 Affiliate Investments are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ( 1940 Act ), as those Non-Control investments in companies in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned by
the Corporation.    

(l) 
 Control Investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in companies in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation or where greater than 50% of the board representation is
maintained.    

(m) 
 Payment in kind (PIK) represents earned interest that is added to the cost basis of the investment.

of investments resulting from new portfolio investment, follow on investments, capitalized interest and the accretion of discounts. Gross additions also include net increases in unrealized appreciation or net decreases in unrealized depreciation,
and the movement of an existing portfolio company into this category and out of another category.    (2) Gross reductions include decreases in the cost basis
of investments resulting from principal repayments, sales, note conversions, net increases in unrealized depreciation, net decreases in unrealized appreciation, the exchange of existing securities for new securities and the movement of an existing
portfolio company out of this category and into another category.    (3) Represents the total amount of interest, fees or dividends credited to income for the
portion of the period an investment was included in Control or Affiliate categories, respectively.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
  (Unaudited)      Note 1. ORGANIZATION
    Rand Capital Corporation ( Rand ,  we ,  us  and  our ) was incorporated under the laws of New
York in February 1969. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 as an internally managed, closed-end, diversified, management investment company. We have elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying
assets  and provide managerial assistance to the portfolio companies in which we invest. See Item 1. Business   Regulation, Regulation as a Business Development Company in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.    The majority of our venture capital investments are completed through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Rand Capital
SBIC, Inc. ( Rand SBIC ), which operates as a small business investment company ( SBIC ) and has been licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) since 2002. Rand SBIC s predecessor was organized as
a Delaware limited partnership and was converted into a New York corporation on December 31, 2008, at which time our operations as a licensed SBIC were continued. Although Rand SBIC was operated as if it were a BDC, it was registered as an
investment company under the 1940 Act. In 2012, the SEC granted an Order of Exemption for Rand with respect to the operations of Rand SBIC, and then Rand SBIC filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Rand SBIC s board of
directors is comprised of the directors of Rand, a majority of whom are not  interested persons  of Rand or Rand SBIC.    We
operate as an internally managed investment company whereby our officers and employees conduct the business of the Corporation under the general supervision of our Board of Directors. We have not elected to qualify to be taxed as a regulated
investment company as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code.    In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context
otherwise requires,  we , the  Corporation ,  us , and  our  refer to Rand Corporation and Rand SBIC.  
 Our corporate office is located in Buffalo, NY and our website address is www.randcapital.com. We make available free of charge on our website
our annual and periodic reports, proxy statements and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Our shares are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market
under the ticker symbol  RAND .     Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   Basis of Presentation     It is our opinion that the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of
a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) of the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and statement of
changes in net assets for the interim periods presented. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted; however, we believe that the
disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading. Our interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.  
      23  

These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Information contained in this filing should also be reviewed in conjunction with our related filings with the SEC prior to the date of this report. Those
filings include, but are not limited to, the following:       
 
    Principles of Consolidation   - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Rand and its wholly-owned subsidiary Rand SBIC. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments     The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statement of financial position of
cash, interest receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  
   Fair Value of SBA Debentures -   In September 2016, the SBIC Funding Corporation completed a pooling of SBA debentures that have a
coupon rate of 2.051%, excluding a mandatory SBA annual charge estimated to be 0.804%, resulting in a total estimated fixed rate for ten years of 2.855%. The carrying value of Rand s SBA debentures is a reasonable estimate of fair value
because stated interest rates approximate current interest rates that are available for debt with similar terms.      Investment
Classification     In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Corporation classifies its investments by level of control. Under the 1940 Act,  Control Investments  are investments in companies that the Corporation is
deemed to  Control  because it owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the company or has greater than 50% representation on the company s board.  Affiliate Investments  are companies in which the Corporation owns
between 5% and 25% of the voting securities.  Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments  are those companies that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.  
   Investments   - Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the Corporation and approved
by the Board of Directors. The Corporation invests in loan instruments, debt instruments, and equity instruments. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be
applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process. The Corporation analyzes and values each investment quarterly, and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it
believes has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or debt security or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful. Conversely, the Corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that an
underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, its equity securities have also appreciated in value. These estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments
existed and these differences could be material if the Corporation s assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events.  
   Qualifying Assets   - All of the Corporation s investments were made in privately held small business enterprises, that were
not investment companies, were principally based in the United States, and represent qualifying assets as defined by Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act.  
   Revenue Recognition - Interest Income   - Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in
default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate.  
      24  

Rand SBIC s interest accrual is also regulated by the SBA s  Accounting Standards
and Financial Reporting Requirements for Small Business Investment Companies.  Under these rules, interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100% reserve must be established. The collection of interest is presumed to
be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or a loan is in default for more than 120 days. Management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the
value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.    After reviewing each of our portfolio companies 
performance and the circumstances surrounding each investment, the Corporation ceased accruing interest income on First Wave Products Group, LLC (First Wave) and a portion of the Mercantile Adjustment Bureau, LLC (Mercantile) outstanding loans in
2015 and G-TEC Natural Gas Systems in 2004.    The Corporation holds debt securities in its investment portfolio that contain
payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual
collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.      Revenue Recognition - Dividend Income
-   The Corporation may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies or corporations and these distributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement of operations. Dividend income
is recognized on an accrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated.    The Corporation holds preferred equity securities that contain
cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, if declared, and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be
deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed.      Revenue Recognition - Fee Income   - Consists of the revenue
associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of Rand SBIC financings and income associated with portfolio company board attendance fees. The income associated with the amortization of
financing fees was $15,948 and $13,667 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The board fees were $3,000 and $8,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   Realized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Investments -   Amounts reported as realized gains and losses
are measured by the difference between the proceeds from the sale or exchange and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses recorded in prior periods. The cost of securities that have, in management s
judgment, become worthless are written off and reported as realized losses when appropriate. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments.  
   Original Issue Discount     Investments may include  original issue discount  or OID income. This occurs when the
Corporation purchases a warrant and a note from a portfolio company simultaneously, which requires an allocation of a portion of the purchase price to the warrant and reduces the note or debt instrument by an equal amount in the form of a note
discount or OID. The note is reported net of the OID and the OID is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. The Corporation recognized $7,497 and $11,619 in OID income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. OID income is estimated to be approximately $2,500 for the remainder of 2016 and $8,350 for 2017.      Deferred Debenture
Costs   - The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standard Update 2015-03 (ASU) requiring that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability. Therefore, the SBA debenture
origination and commitment costs are presented as a direct deduction from the debt liability (see Note 6). As a result $199,627 was reclassified from other assets to debentures guaranteed by the SBA in the accompanying consolidated statement of
financial position as of  
      25  

December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the balance in debt issuance costs was $179,077. These costs are amortized ratably over the terms of the SBA debentures and are expensed
when the debt is repaid early. Amortization expense was $20,550 for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Amortization over the next five years is estimated to be approximately $27,000 per year.  
   SBA Debenture -   The Corporation had $8,000,000 in outstanding SBA debentures at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.54% as of September 30, 2016. The debentures are presented net of deferred debenture costs (see Note 6). The $8,000,000 in outstanding SBA leverage matures from 2022 through 2025.  
 In the event of a future default of such SBA obligations, the Corporation has consented to the exercise, by the SBA, of all rights of the SBA
under 13 C.F.R. 107.1810(i)  SBA remedies for automatic events of default  and has agreed to take all actions that the SBA may so require. These may include the Corporation s automatic consent to the appointment of the SBA, or its
designee, as receiver under Section 311(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.      Net Assets per Share   - Net
assets per share are based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding. We do not have any common stock equivalents outstanding.  
   Supplemental Cash Flow Information   - Income taxes paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$1,995,948 and $2,347,317, respectively. Interest paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $283,650 and $269,066, respectively. The Corporation converted $16,711 and $69,710 of interest receivable into investments
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Accounting Estimates   - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
   Stockholders  Equity (Net Assets) -   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 500,000 shares of
$10.00 par value preferred stock authorized and unissued.    On October 19, 2016, the Board of Directors extended the repurchase
authorization for up to 1,000,000 shares of the Corporation s outstanding common stock on the open market through October 19, 2017 at prices that are no greater than the then current net asset value. There were 6,550 shares repurchased
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the total treasury shares held was 541,046 shares with a total cost of $1,469,105 at September 30, 2016. Therefore, at September 30, 2016, the Corporation had authorization to
purchase up to an additional 458,954 shares of common stock.      Profit Sharing and Stock Option Plan    -  In 2001, the
stockholders of the Corporation authorized the establishment of an Employee Stock Option Plan (the  Option Plan ), that provides for the award of stock options to purchase up to 200,000 common shares to eligible employees. In 2002, the
Corporation placed the Option Plan on inactive status as it developed a new profit sharing plan for the Corporation s employees in connection with the formation of its SBIC subsidiary. As of September 30, 2016, no stock options had been
awarded under the Option Plan. Because Section 57(n) of the 1940 Act prohibits maintenance of a profit sharing plan for the officers and employees of a BDC where any option, warrant or right is outstanding under an executive compensation plan,
no stock options will be granted under the Option Plan while any profit sharing plan is in effect with respect to the Corporation.  
      26  

In 2002, the Corporation established a Profit Sharing Plan (the  Plan ) for its
executive officers in accordance with Section 57(n) of the 1940 Act. Under the Plan, the Corporation will pay its executive officers aggregate profit sharing payments equal to 12% of the net realized capital gains of its SBIC subsidiary, net of
all realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation of the SBIC subsidiary, for the fiscal year, computed in accordance with the Plan and the Corporation s interpretation of the Plan. Any profit sharing paid or accrued cannot exceed 20% of
the Corporation s net income, as defined in the Plan. For purposes of the 20% profit sharing test, the Corporation interprets net income to be the total of the Corporation s net investment gain (loss) and its net realized gain
(loss) on investments, prior to inclusion of the estimated profit sharing obligation. The profit sharing payments are split equally between the Corporation s two executive officers, each of whom is fully vested in the Plan.  
 The Corporation accrued $1,411,659 under the Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no amounts earned pursuant to
the Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Estimated payroll taxes and benefits on the profit sharing under the Plan have been accrued at September 30, 2016. The amounts accrued do not exceed the defined limits under the Plan.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Corporation approved and accrued $899,500 under the Plan, of which $717,500 was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Income Taxes -   The Corporation reviews the tax positions it has taken to determine if they meet a  more likely than not
threshold  for the benefit of the tax position to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. A tax position that fails to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold will result in either a reduction of a current or
deferred tax asset or receivable, or the recording of a current or deferred tax liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there was an $18,500 increase in the current tax liability offset by an $8,500 decrease in previous
reserves, resulting in a net $10,000 change in uncertain tax positions. There were no new uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2015.  
 It is the Corporation s policy to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense. There were no
amounts recognized for interest or penalties related to tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
   Concentration of Credit and Market Risk     The Corporation s financial instruments potentially subject it to
concentrations of credit risk. Cash is invested with banks in amounts which, at times, exceed insurable limits. Management does not anticipate non-performance by such banks.  
 At September 30, 2016, Rheonix, Inc. (Rheonix), Genicon, Inc. (Genicon), Outmatch (formerly Chequed Holdings, LLC) (Outmatch), Social
Flow, Inc. (Social Flow) and SciAps, Inc. (Sciaps) represented 11%, 10%, 8%, 8% and 7%, respectively, of the fair value of the Corporation s investment portfolio.  
   Reclassification     Certain balances in prior years were reclassified to conform to presentations adopted in 2016.  
  Note 3. INVESTMENTS        The
Corporation s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.    Loan investments are defined as traditional loan financings with no
equity features. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock purchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. A financing may also be categorized as a debt financing if
it is accompanied by the direct purchase of an equity interest in the company.  
      27  

The Corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main
approaches are:         

Loan and debt securities are valued at cost when it is representative of the fair value of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio company at its
estimated fair value.      The loan and debt securities are typically carried at cost, however, may be valued at an amount other
than the price the security would command given the rate and related inherent portfolio risk of the investment.    A loan or debt
instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality, collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist.      

Equity securities may be valued using the  asset approach ,  market approach  or  income approach.  The asset approach involves estimating the liquidation value of the portfolio
company s assets. To the extent the value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the debt or loan and all other debt securities of the portfolio company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their
cost. However, where value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities, the Corporation may discount the value of such securities. The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant
information generated by similar market transactions. It may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant
equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. The income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment.    
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:  
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in the Corporation s valuation at the measurement date.
   Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.    Level 3: Unobservable and significant
inputs to determining the fair value.    Financial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used
to measure their fair value.    Any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as  Net (decrease)
increase in unrealized depreciation or appreciation on investments.     Under the valuation policy, the Corporation values unrestricted
publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the average closing bid price for the last three trading days of the reporting period. There were no such Level 1 investments as of September 30, 2016.  
 In the valuation process, the Corporation values restricted securities, categorized as Level 3 investments, using financial information from
these portfolio companies, which may include:      

Financial information obtained from each portfolio company, including audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets;    

Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company;        

Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;        

The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur;    
      28  

Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;        

Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions;        

Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed;        

Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company;        

Internal occurrences that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company;        

Qualitative assessment of key management;        

Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and        

Other factors deemed relevant by the Corporation s management to assess valuation.      This
information is used to determine financial condition, performance, and valuation of the portfolio companies. The valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the factors that
led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.     Equity Securities   
 Equity Securities may include Preferred Stock, Common Stock, Warrants and Limited Liability Company Membership Interests.  
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s equity investments are earnings before
interest, tax and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard
industry multiples may be used when available; however, the Corporation s portfolio companies are typically small and in early stages of development and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and
operational performance of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs, such as
variances in financial performance from expectations, may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.
   Another key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction with a sophisticated
non-strategic unrelated new investor entered into by the portfolio company. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the Corporation, and the impact of the difference in
transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.    When appropriate the
Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes. This model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the valuation
of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.  
 For recent investments, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair
market value inputs are identified causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.     Loan and Debt Securities   
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s loan and debt securities are the financial and
operational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, as well as the market acceptance for the portfolio company s products or services. These inputs will likely provide an indicator
as to the probability of principal recovery of the investment. The  
      29  

Corporation s loan and debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured debt securities. Fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant
changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a change in fair value. For recent investments, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair market value inputs are identified
causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.    The following table provides a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used to
determine the fair value of the Corporation s Level 3 portfolio investments as of September 30, 2016:

NOTE 4. OTHER ASSETS   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, other assets was comprised of the following:  
   
   During 2014, the Corporation sold its investment in BinOptics Corporation and a portion of the proceeds are
held in escrow and scheduled to be released to the Corporation during 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, Gemcor II, LLC sold its assets, and a portion of the proceeds are held in escrow and will be released during 2017. Both escrow receivables
are subject to potential claims.     Note 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
 The Corporation did not have any commitments to fund any investments as of September 30, 2016.  
  Note 6. SBA DEBENTURES     Pursuant to
Accounting Standard Update 2015-03 (ASU), the debt origination costs directly associated with the SBA debt obligations are presented as a direct deduction for the related debt liability.

Note 7. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   
 The following schedule provides the financial highlights, calculated based on weighted average shares outstanding, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015:      

(1) 
  Per share data are based on weighted average shares outstanding and the results are rounded to the nearest cent.     
 The Corporation s interim period results could fluctuate as a result of a number of factors; therefore results for any interim period
should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance for the full year or in future periods.  
      34  

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations     You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of
trends in operating results for any future periods.     FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   
 Statements included in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this
report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking statements may be included in documents that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements
relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions and are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as  believes, 
 forecasts,   intends,   possible,   expects,   estimates,   anticipates,  or  plans  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among the
important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the state of the United States economy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of the
our portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption  Risk Factors  contained
in Part II, Item 1A of this report and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 There may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement
speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.  
  Overview     We are an internally managed
investment company that invests in and lends to small and medium-sized companies primarily in connection with loans or investments made concurrently by other investors. We have elected to be treated as a business development company
( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We make the majority of our investments through our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. ( Rand SBIC ), which operates as a small business investment company ( SBIC ) and has been licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) since 2002. We anticipate that most, if not
all, of our investments made in the next year will be originated through our SBIC subsidiary.  
      35  

Outlook   
 At the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had approximately $12 million in cash on hand, which is available for future investment and
operating needs. We believe the combination of cash on hand and prospective investment income provides sufficient capital for us to continue to add new investments to our portfolio, while continuing to reinvest in existing portfolio companies that
continue to demonstrate growth potential. The following short and long-term trends provide us with confidence in our ability to grow Rand:      

We expect that well run U.S. businesses will require capital to continue to grow given the low cost of capital, strong business and consumer spending, and eager reception of new technologies and service concepts. We
believe Rand will be able to participate in financing these businesses.        

We have sufficient cash on hand to invest in new opportunities.        

Given our available cash on hand, we are able to invest larger amounts in companies, which, we believe, will provide an opportunity to accelerate our rate of growth.    

We will continue to manage risk by investing with other investors, when possible.        

We are actively involved with the governance and management of our portfolio companies, which enables us to support their operating and marketing efforts to facilitate their growth.    

As our portfolio of investments continues to expand, we are able to better leverage our infrastructure.    
  Critical Accounting Policies     We prepare
our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. A summary of our
critical accounting policies can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
      36  

Financial Condition       
   Net asset value per share (NAV) was $5.20 at September 30, 2016 and $5.35 at December 31, 2015.  
 Our outstanding SBA debentures at September 30, 2016 were $8,000,000 and will mature from 2022 through 2025. Cash approximated 36% of net
assets at September 30, 2016 as compared to 17% at December 31, 2015. The change is primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the asset sale of one of our investments, Gemcor II, LLC, in March 2016.  
  Composition of Our Investment Portfolio   
 Our financial condition is dependent on the success of our portfolio holdings. We have invested substantially all of our assets in small to
medium-sized companies. The following summarizes our investment portfolio at the dates indicated.      
   Our total investments at fair value, as estimated by management and approved by our Board of Directors,
approximated 84% of net assets at September 30, 2016 versus 109% of net assets at December 31, 2015 with the change primarily due to the asset sale of one of our investments, Gemcor II, LLC.  
 The change in investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, at cost, is comprised of the following:  

37  

Results of Operations   
  Investment Income     Our investment
objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments while investing in a mixture of loan, debenture and equity instruments, which are structured to provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio.  
   Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015    
   
    Interest from portfolio companies    Interest income from portfolio companies decreased during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to decreases in the principal balances outstanding on loan and debt investments with Gemcor, II, LLC (Gemcor) and Carolina Skiff, LLC (Carolina Skiff),
respectively, and the timing of our new debt investments made during 2016 which offset these repayments.    After reviewing their
performance and the circumstances surrounding our investments, we ceased accruing interest income on First Wave Products Group, LLC (First Wave) and a portion of the Mercantile Adjustment Bureau, LLC (Mercantile) outstanding loan balances during
2015.     Interest from other investments  - The increase in interest from other investments is primarily due to higher average cash balances during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015.     Dividend and other investment income  - Dividend income is comprised
of distributions from limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations in which we have invested. Our investment agreements with certain LLCs require those LLCs to distribute funds to us for payment of income taxes on our allocable share of the
LLC s profits. These portfolio companies may also elect to make additional discretionary distributions. Dividend income will fluctuate based upon the profitability of these LLCs and corporations and the timing of the distributions or the impact
of new investments or divestitures. Dividend and other investment income decreased in 2016 due to the asset sale of Gemcor II, LLC during March 2016. The dividend distributions for the respective periods were:  

38  

Fee income  - Fee income consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged
to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of Rand SBIC financings and income from portfolio company board attendance fees. The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees. The unamortized
fees are carried on the balance sheet under the line item  Deferred revenue.     The income associated with the amortization of
financing fees was $15,948 and $13,667 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income from board fees was $3,000 and $8,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Operating Expenses       Comparison of the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015        
   Operating expenses predominately consist of interest expense on outstanding SBA borrowings, compensation
expense, and general and administrative expenses including stockholder and office operating expenses and professional fees.    The increase
in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was comprised primarily of a $1,411,659 increase in bonus and profit sharing expense and an 87%, or $110,782, increase in professional fees.  
 Our largest portfolio company, in terms of fair value, Gemcor II, LLC (Gemcor) sold its assets during March 2016 and based on our ownership
percentage, we received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,588,813 and included $1,068,750 that continued to be held in escrow at September 30, 2016. The escrow
holdback is recorded in  Other Assets  on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow is scheduled to be released during 2017, subject to potential claims. Related to this asset sale, we accrued $1,411,659
under our Profit Sharing Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, that is payable to our executive officers. There were no amounts earned pursuant to the Profit Sharing Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Professional fees were also higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015 because we incurred
additional expenses in connection with implementing our long-term growth strategy. These expenses included external legal, tax consulting and other advisory expenses to support refinement of our strategy, which involved assessing options
relative to the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.

Realized Gains and Losses on Investments   
   Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015    
   
   During the first quarter of 2016, our portfolio company Gemcor II, LLC sold its assets, and accordingly, we
received gross cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, excluding amounts that continue to be held in escrow, and recognized a realized gain, before income taxes, of $14,588,813.  
 In addition, we recorded a realized gain of $168,140 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the earn out provision in
connection with the 2014 sale of QuaDPharma, LLC to Athenex Inc.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a
net realized gain, before income taxes, of $262,925 on the sale of 301,582 shares of Synacor, Inc. (Synacor). As of September 30, 2015, we did not own any shares of Synacor.  
  Change in Unrealized Depreciation or Appreciation of Investments   
   Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015    
   
   The decrease in unrealized depreciation or appreciation before income taxes for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was comprised of the following:      
   During the first quarter of 2016, our portfolio company, Gemcor II, LLC sold its assets and we received gross
cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The realized gain from the sale, before income taxes, was $14,588,813 and included $1,068,750 that was held in escrow at September 30, 2016. The escrow holdback is recorded in  Other
Assets  on the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The escrow is scheduled to be released during 2017, subject to potential claims.  
 The valuation of our investment in Statisfy was decreased after we reviewed the portfolio company and its financial condition and determined
that a valuation adjustment was necessary.    Our investment in Teleservices was revalued after we reviewed their operations and their
current and past financial performance. This review indicated that a further deterioration of their business had occurred. If the factors that led to this reduction in valuation are overcome, the value may be restored. The portfolio company remains
in operation and is developing new business strategies.  
      40  

The valuation of our investment in Knoa was decreased during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 to value our equity investment at a value consistent with the anticipated pricing for Knoa s future equity financing.  
 In accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our investment in Athenex based on a significant equity financing by a new
non-strategic outside entity. This new financing used a higher valuation for Athenex than had been used for its prior financing rounds.  
 Intrinsiq s value was increased based on a financial analysis of the portfolio company, completed by management, indicating continued
improved performance and the completion of an equity refinancing in the third quarter of 2016.    The decrease in unrealized appreciation
before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was comprised of the following:      
   In accordance with our valuation policy, we increased the value of our holdings in Athenex and Social Flow
based on significant equity financings for each made during 2015 by new non-strategic outside investors at a higher valuation for each than their prior financing round valuation.  
 The First Wave investment was revalued after our management reviewed the portfolio company and its financial condition and determined that a
valuation adjustment was necessary.    We sold our remaining shares of Synacor during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 The Teleservices investment was revalued during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 after our management reviewed the portfolio
company and determined that the business had deteriorated since the time of the original funding.    All of these value adjustments resulted
from a review by our management using the guidance set forth by ASC 820 and our established valuation policy.     Net (Decrease) Increase in Net Assets
from Operations     We account for our operations under GAAP for investment companies. The principal measure of our financial performance
is  net (decrease) increase in net assets from operations  on our consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net (decrease) increase in net assets from operations was ($986,912)
and $609,141, respectively.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Our principal objective is to achieve growth in net asset value per share through capital appreciation. Therefore, a significant portion of our
investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation, and certain portfolio investments may be structured to provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments.  
      41  

As of September 30, 2016, our total liquidity consisted of approximately $11.7 million in
cash on hand.    Management expects that the cash on hand at September 30, 2016, coupled with the scheduled interest payments from our
portfolio investments, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs through the next twelve months. As a result of the reduction of investment income related to the Gemcor asset sale, we expect to continue to look for new investment opportunities
that provide interest and dividend payments so as to provide cash flow to cover operating costs. Future exits from portfolio companies may increase the amount of liquidity available for new investments, operating activities and future SBA debenture
obligations.     Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 Our investment activities contain elements of risk. Our investment portfolio consists of equity and debt securities in private companies and is
subject to valuation risk. Because there is typically no public market for the equity and debt securities in which we invest, the valuation of the equity interests in the portfolio is stated at  fair value  as determined in good faith by
our management and approved by our Board of Directors. This is in accordance with our investment valuation policy (see the discussion of valuation policy contained in  Note 3.-Investments  in the consolidated financial statements contained
in Item 1 of this report, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.) In the absence of readily ascertainable market values, the estimated value of the portfolio may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the
portfolio if a ready market for the investments existed. Any changes in valuation are recorded on the consolidated statement of operations as  Net (decrease) increase in unrealized appreciation on investments.   
 At times, a portion of our portfolio may include marketable securities traded in the over-the-counter market. In addition, there may be a
portion of the portfolio for which no regular trading market exists. In order to realize the full value of a security, the market must trade in an orderly fashion or a willing purchaser must be available when a sale is to be made. Should an economic
or other event occur that would not allow markets to trade in an orderly fashion, we may not be able to realize the fair value of our marketable investments or other investments in a timely manner.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or hedging or similar derivative financial instrument
investments.     Item 4.   Controls and Procedures   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  The Corporation maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that this
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the Corporation s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.

  ARTICLE I      SHAREHOLDERS
     SECTION 1.   ANNUAL MEETING.  The annual meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of electing directors and of
transacting such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on the date selected by the Board of Directors in each calendar year.  
  SECTION 2.   SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or a
majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office. The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting, other than procedural matters and matters relating to the conduct of the special meeting, shall be the matter or matters
described in the notice of such special meeting.     SECTION 3.   NOTICE OF MEETINGS   WAIVER.  Not less than ten
(10) or more than fifty (50) days  notice of any regular or special meeting of the shareholders shall be given by the Secretary either personally or by mail (written or electronic) to each shareholder entitled to vote. Waiver by a
shareholder of notice of a shareholders  meeting (i) in writing and signed by such shareholder or (ii) by electronic transmission, whether before or after the time of the meeting, shall be equivalent to giving of such notice.
Attendance by a shareholder without objection to the notice, whether in person or by proxy, at a shareholders  meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting.  
  SECTION 4.   PLACE OF MEETING.  Meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be held at the principal place of business of
the Corporation or at such other place within or without New York State, as shall be determined by the Chairman of the Board or of the Board of Directors.  
  SECTION 5.   DETERMINATION OF SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES.  In order to determine the holders of record of the
Corporation s stock who are entitled to notice of meetings, to vote at a meeting or adjournment thereof, to receive payment of any dividend, or to make a determination of the shareholders of record for any other purpose, the Board of Directors
will fix a date as the record date for such determination of shareholders. Such date shall be no more than fifty (50) days prior to the date of action which requires such determination, nor, in the case of a shareholders  meeting, shall it
be less than ten (10) days in advance of such meeting. If no record date is fixed for such determination of the shareholders, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring a
dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of the shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall
apply to any adjournment of such meeting.  
      1  

SECTION 6.   PROXIES.  A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy executed in
writing by the shareholder, or his duly authorized attorney in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  
  SECTION 7.   QUORUM.  The presence in person or by proxy of holders of the majority of outstanding stock entitled to vote shall be
necessary to constitute a quorum. In case a quorum shall not be present at any duly called meeting, the majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, not exceeding thirty (30) days at any one time, until a quorum shall be
present and the business of the meeting accomplished, and of such adjourned meeting, no notice need be given.     SECTION 8. 
 ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any meeting of shareholders may be adjourned to a designated time and place, not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, by the presiding officer of the meeting or by
a vote of a majority in interest of the shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, even though less than a quorum is so present, for any reason or no reason from time to time. No notice of such an adjournment need be given,
other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.  
  SECTION 9.   NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER NOMINEES.  Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of shares having a preference
over the common shares as to dividends or upon liquidation, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures set forth in these By-Laws shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Nominations of persons

must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders;  provided ,  however , that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such
anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; and (ii) with respect to a special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later

special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of a meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder s notice as described above.  
 To be in proper written form, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth (i) the name and record address (as they appear

  SECTION 10.   NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS.  No business (other than nominations for the election of directors, if made in

for inclusion of a shareholder s proposal in an issuer s proxy materials.    In addition to any other applicable requirement, for
business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.  
      4  

To be timely, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and

arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareholder or any such beneficial owner has a right to vote any shares of the Corporation; and (F) a representation that such shareholder will notify the Corporation in writing
of the information required in clauses (A) through (E), in each case as in effect as of the record date for the meeting, promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed;
(iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder or any such beneficial owner and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder and of
any material interest of such shareholder or any such beneficial owner or any other persons in such business (together with information for any such other persons covering the matters set forth in clause (iii)); (v) such other information
relating to the proposal that is required to be disclosed in solicitations pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law; and (vi) a representation that such
shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.  
      5  

No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought
before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10, provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this
Section 10 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the presiding officer of a meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures,
the presiding officer shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted  
  SECTION 11.   MEETING PROCEDURES.  At each meeting of shareholders, the order of business and all other matters of procedure shall
be determined by the presiding officer for the meeting. The presiding officer shall have all the powers and authority vested in a presiding officer by law or practice without restriction, including, without limitation, the authority, in order to
conduct an orderly meeting, to announce the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls, to impose reasonable limits on the amount of time at the meeting taken up in remarks by any one shareholder and to declare any business not properly
brought before the meeting to be out of order and such business shall not be transacted. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate.  
  ARTICLE II      SHARES AND
THEIR TRANSFER      SECTION 1.   CERTIFICATED OR UNCERTIFICATED SHARES . The shares of the Corporation may be represented by
certificates or they may be uncertificated shares. Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, the board of directors may provide by resolution that some or all of any or all classes and series of the Corporation s shares shall
be uncertificated shares, provided that any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.  
  SECTION 2.   CERTIFICATED SHARES SIGNATURES . If shares of the Corporation are represented by certificates, the certificates
shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board or the president or a vice-president and the secretary or an assistant secretary or the treasurer or an assistant treasurer of the Corporation, and may be sealed with the seal of the
Corporation or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of the officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if : (1) the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar other than the Corporation itself or its
employee, or (2) the shares are listed on a registered national securities exchange. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to hold his or her office before the
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she held the office at the date of issue.  
      6  

SECTION 3.   CERTIFICATED SHARES REQUIRED STATEMENTS.  Each certificate
