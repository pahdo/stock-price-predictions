    2. Summary of significant accounting policies  
 (a) Basis of preparation and principles of consolidation 
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include certain information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial reporting and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and reflect the financial statements of Genpact Limited, a Bermuda company, and all of its subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned and controlled. When the Company does not have a controlling interest in an entity but exerts significant influence on the entity, the Company applies the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries that is redeemable outside of the Company s control for cash or other assets is reflected in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity in the consolidated balance sheets at the redeemable value, which approximates fair value. Redeemable non-controlling interest is adjusted to its fair value at each balance sheet date. Any resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are affected by corresponding charges to additional paid-in capital. The share of non-controlling interest in subsidiary earnings is reflected in net loss (income) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of income. 
 (b) Use of estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill, revenue recognition, reserves for doubtful receivables, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, measurements of stock-based compensation, assets and obligations related to employee benefits, and income tax uncertainties and other contingencies. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates. Any changes in estimates are adjusted prospectively in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 (c) Business combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets 
 The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Contingent consideration is included within the acquisition cost and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. All assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including goodwill, are assigned to reporting units. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred under Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

    2. Summar  y of significant accounting policies   (Continued)  
 Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis on December 31, based on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans and future cash flows. The Company performs an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment of events or circumstances, the Company performs a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment if it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, based on the quantitative impairment analysis, the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of such goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. In addition, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 10 for information and related disclosures. 
   
 Intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets or in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortization based on their estimated useful lives as follows: 

Customer-related intangible assets  

1-14 years  

Marketing-related intangible assets  

1-10 years  

Other intangible assets  

3-9 years  

Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. 
 In business combinations where the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased exceeds the cost of the acquired business, the Company recognizes the resulting gain under  Other operating (income) expense, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 (d) Financial instruments and concentration of credit risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk are reflected principally in cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments with corporations and banks with high investment grade ratings, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one corporation or bank and conducts ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of the corporations and banks with which it does business. To reduce its credit risk on accounts receivable, the Company conducts ongoing credit evaluations of its clients. GE accounted for 18% and 15% of receivables as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. GE accounted for 19% and 17% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and 19% and 15% of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  
 (e) Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
 The following recently released accounting standards have been adopted by the Company. Adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures: 
 Effective January 1, 2016, the Company has adopted FASB ASU 2015-01 (Topic 225): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01 ). Such items are defined as transactions or events that are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence, and, currently, are required to be presented separately in the income statement, net of income tax, after income from continuing operations. The changes eliminate the concept of an extraordinary item and, therefore, the presentation of such items will no longer be required. Notwithstanding this change, the Company will still be required to present and disclose a transaction or event that is both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence in the notes to the financial statements.

    2.   Summary of significant accounting policies   (Continued)  
 Effective January 1, 2016, the Company has adopted FASB ASU 2015-05 (Topic 350), Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides explicit guidance to evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The new guidance clarifies that if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. 
 Effective January 1, 2016, the Company has adopted FASB ASU 2015-16 (Topic 805), Business Combinations, which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. The guidance requires that the acquirer shall recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. 
 Effective January 1, 2016, the Company has adopted FASB ASU 2015-02. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendment to the Consolidation Analysis, which specifies changes to the analysis that an entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. These changes (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and (iv) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

    6. Fair value measuremen  ts  
 The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments, at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value measurements of these derivative instruments were determined using the following inputs as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016:

(d)   
 
 The fair value of earn-out consideration, calculated as the present value of expected future payments to be made to the sellers of acquired businesses, was derived by estimating the future financial performance of the acquired businesses using the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and adjusting the result to reflect the Company s estimate of the likelihood of achievement of such targets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs, the valuations are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.    

(e)   
 
 The Company s estimate of the fair value of redeemable non-controlling interest as of September 30, 2016 is based on unobservable inputs considering the assumptions that market participants would make in pricing the obligation. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs, the valuation was classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 3 Business Acquisitions.

    7. Derivative financial instruments  
 The Company is exposed to the risk of rate fluctuations on its foreign currency assets and liabilities and on foreign currency denominated forecasted cash flows. The Company has established risk management policies, including the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities, foreign currency denominated forecasted cash flows and interest rate risk. These derivative financial instruments are largely deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The Company enters into these contracts with counterparties that are banks or other financial institutions, and the Company considers the risk of non-performance by such counterparties not to be material. The forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps mature during a period of up to 51 months and the forecasted transactions are expected to occur during the same period. 
 The following table presents the aggregate notional principal amounts of outstanding derivative financial instruments together with the related balance sheet exposure: 

(a)   
 
 Notional amounts are key elements of derivative financial instrument agreements but do not represent the amount exchanged by counterparties and do not measure the Company s exposure to credit or market risks. However, the amounts exchanged are based on the notional amounts and other provisions of the underlying derivative financial instrument agreements.    

(b)   
 
 Balance sheet exposure is denominated in U.S. dollars and denotes the mark-to-market impact of the derivative financial instruments on the reporting date.    

 FASB guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. In accordance with the FASB guidance on Derivatives and Hedging, the Company designates foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to cover the effects of future exchange rate variability on forecasted revenues and purchases of services, and interest rate swaps are entered into to cover interest rate fluctuation risk. In addition to this program, the Company uses derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges under the FASB guidance in order to hedge foreign exchange risks related to balance sheet items, such as receivables and intercompany borrowings, that are denominated in currencies other than the Company s underlying functional currency.

 Cash flow hedges 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain (loss) on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Gains (losses) on the derivatives, representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings as incurred. 
 In connection with cash flow hedges, the gains (losses) recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and the related tax effects are summarized below:

Amortization expenses for intangible assets disclosed in the consolidated statements of income under amortization of acquired intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were $21,875 and $19,764, respectively, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were $7,219 and $7,126, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company tested for recoverability an intangible software asset as a result of a downward revision to the forecasted cash flows with respect to the use of the asset and a customer related intangible asset as a result of the termination of a client contract. 
 Based on the results of such testing, the Company determined that the carrying value of these intangible assets exceed their estimated undiscounted cash flows by $11,195 and recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value by this amount.  Of this charge, $5,381 was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company used a combination of the income and cost approaches to determine the fair value of the intangible assets for the purpose of calculating the resulting charge. This charge has been recorded in other operating (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of income.

    12. Long-term debt  
 In June 2015, the Company refinanced the 2012 Facility through a new credit facility, comprised of an $800,000 term loan and a $350,000 revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the new facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the election of the Company, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin equal to 1.50% per annum or a base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.50% per annum, in each case subject to adjustment based on the Company s debt ratings provided by Standard   Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Based on the Company s election and current credit rating, the applicable interest rate is equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum. As a result of the June 2015 refinancing, the gross outstanding term loan under the 2012 Facility, which amounted to $663,188 as of June 30, 2015, was extinguished, and the Company expensed $10,050, representing accelerated amortization of the existing unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2012 Facility. Additionally, the refinancing of the revolving facility resulted in the accelerated amortization of $65 relating to the existing unamortized debt issuance cost. The remaining unamortized costs for the revolving facility, together with the fees paid to the Company s lenders and third parties in connection with the new term loan and revolving facility, will be amortized over the term of the refinanced facility, which ends on June 30, 2020.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement.   
 As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding under the term loan, net of debt amortization expense of $3,534 and $2,881, was $776,466 and $747,119, respectively.  As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the term loan bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% per annum based on the Company s election and current credit rating.  Indebtedness under the refinanced facility is unsecured. The amount outstanding on the term loan as of September 30, 2016 will be repaid through quarterly payments of $10,000, and the balance will be repaid upon the maturity of the term loan on June 30, 2020. 
 The maturity profile of the term loan, net of debt amortization expense, is as follows:

    16. Stock-based compensation  
 The Company has issued options under the Genpact Global Holdings 2005 Plan (the  2005 Plan ), the Genpact Global Holdings 2006 Plan (the  2006 Plan ), the Genpact Global Holdings 2007 Plan (the  2007 Plan ) and the Genpact Limited 2007 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2007 Omnibus Plan ) to eligible persons, who are employees, directors and certain other persons associated with the Company. 
 With respect to options granted under the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Plans before the date of adoption of the 2007 Omnibus Plan, if an award granted under any such plan is forfeited or otherwise expires, terminates, or is cancelled without the delivery of shares, then the shares covered by the forfeited, expired, terminated, or cancelled award will be added to the number of shares otherwise available for grant under the applicable plan. 
 Beginning on July 13, 2007, the date of adoption of the 2007 Omnibus Plan, share-based awards forfeited, expired, terminated, or cancelled under any of the plans are added to the number of shares otherwise available for grant under the 2007 Omnibus Plan. The 2007 Omnibus Plan was amended and restated on April 11, 2012 to increase the number of common shares authorized for issuance by 5,593,200 shares to 15,000,000 shares. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2012, the number of common shares authorized for issuance under the 2007 Omnibus Plan and the 2005 Plan was increased by 8,858,823 and 495,915 shares, respectively, as the result of an adjustment to outstanding unvested share awards. 
 Stock-based compensation costs relating to the foregoing plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were $17,279 and $18,046, respectively, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were $6,124 and $4,718, respectively. Stock-based compensation costs for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 have been reduced by $1,874 due to a change in the probability of achievement of the performance conditions for the performance units granted in the second quarter of 2016. These costs have been allocated to cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
 Stock options 
 Options granted are subject to a vesting requirement. Options granted under the plan are exercisable into common shares of the Company, have a contractual period of ten years and vest over four to five years unless specified otherwise in the applicable award agreement. The Company recognizes the compensation cost over the vesting period of the option. Compensation cost is determined as of the date of grant by estimating the fair value of an option using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
 The following table shows the significant assumptions used in connection with the determination of the fair value of options granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016.

 A summary of stock option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is set out below: 

(a)   
 
 Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.    

 As of September 30, 2016, the total remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for options expected to vest amounted to $14,606, which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining requisite vesting period of 2.7 years. 
 Restricted share units 
 The Company has granted restricted share units ( RSUs ) under the 2007 Omnibus Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive one Company common share at a future date. The fair value of each RSU is the market price of a Company common share on the date of the grant. The RSUs granted to date have graded vesting schedules of three months to four years. The compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. A summary of RSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is set out below: 

(a)   
 
 RSUs that vested during the period were net settled upon vesting by issuing 28,344 shares (net of minimum statutory tax withholding).    

(b)   
 
 The number of RSUs expected to vest reflects an estimated forfeiture rate.    

 92,692 RSUs vested in the year ended December 31, 2014, in respect of which 91,963 shares were issued in January 2016 after withholding shares to the extent of the minimum statutory withholding taxes.  
 53,546 RSUs vested in the year ended December 31, 2015, shares in respect of which will be issuable on December 31, 2016 after withholding shares to the extent of minimum statutory withholding taxes.

 As of September 30, 2016, the total remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to RSUs amounted to $2,271, which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining requisite vesting period of 2.2 years. 
 Performance units 
 The Company also grants stock awards in the form of performance units ( PUs ) under the 2007 Omnibus Plan. 
 Each PU represents the right to receive one Company common share at a future date based on the Company s performance against specified targets. PUs granted to date have vesting schedules of six months to three years. The fair value of each PU is the market price of one common share of the Company on the date of grant and assumes that performance targets will be achieved. PUs granted under the plan are subject to cliff vesting. The compensation expense for such awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms. Over the performance period, the number of shares to be issued is adjusted upward or downward depending on the probability of achievement of the performance targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized is based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. 
 A summary of PU activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is set out below: 

(a)   
 
 Represents an adjustment made in March 2016 to the number of shares underlying the PUs granted in 2015 upon certification of the level of achievement of the performance targets for such awards.    

(b)   
 
 The number of PUs expected to vest is based on the probable achievement of the performance targets after considering an estimated forfeiture rate.    

 As of September 30, 2016, the total remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to PUs amounted to $12,842, which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining requisite vesting period of 1.1 years. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) 
 On May 1, 2008, the Company adopted the Genpact Limited U.S. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Genpact Limited International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together, the  ESPP ). 
 The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company s common shares through payroll deductions at 90% of the closing price of the Company s common shares on the last business day of each purchase interval. The dollar amount of common shares purchased under the ESPP must not exceed 15% of the participating employee s base salary, subject to a cap of $25 per employee per calendar year. With effect from September 1, 2009, the offering periods commence on the first business day in March, June, September and December of each year and end on the last business day of the subsequent May, August, November and February. 4,200,000 common shares have been reserved for issuance in the aggregate over the term of the ESPP.

17. Capital stock 
 Share repurchases 
 In February 2015, the Company s board of directors (the  Board ) authorized a program to repurchase up to $250,000 in value of the Company s common shares. On February 4, 2016, the Board approved up to an additional $250,000 in share repurchases under the program, and on September 19, 2016 the Board again approved up to an additional $250,000 in share repurchases, bringing the total authorization under the Company s existing program to $750,000. The Company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be purchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 7,110,153 and 9,615,323 of its common shares, respectively, at a weighted average price of $22.37 and $25.23 per share, respectively, for an aggregate cash amount of $159,036 and $242,552, respectively. The purchased shares have been retired. 
 The Company records repurchases of its common shares on the settlement date of each transaction. Shares purchased and retired are deducted to the extent of their par value from common stock and from retained earnings for the excess over par value. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares purchased. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, $142 and $192, respectively, was deducted from retained earnings in direct costs related to share repurchases.

    18. Earnings per share  
 The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with FASB guidance on earnings per share. Basic and diluted earnings per common share give effect to the change in the number of Company common shares outstanding. The calculation of basic earnings per common share is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Potentially dilutive shares, consisting of outstanding options on common shares, restricted share units, performance units and common shares to be issued under the employee stock purchase plan, have been included in the computation of diluted net earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding, except where the result would be anti-dilutive. 
 The number of stock awards outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their effect was anti-dilutive is 3,704,667 and 698,286 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and 3,593,000 and 947,778 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Results   of Operations  
 The following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. 

37 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 Net revenues.  Our net revenues were $648.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $31.0 million, or 5.0%, from $617.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The growth in net revenues was primarily driven by an increase in business process outsourcing, or BPO, services delivered to our Global Clients. Adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily changes in the values of the U.K. pound sterling, Australian dollar and euro against the U.S. dollar, which had an adverse impact on our net revenues in the third quarter of 2016, our net revenues grew 6.8% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. We provide information about our revenue on a constant currency basis so that our revenue may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Total net revenues on a constant currency basis are calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates and hedging gains/losses.   
 Our average headcount increased by 8.1% to approximately 73,200 in the third quarter of 2016 from approximately 67,700 in the third quarter of 2015. 

Net revenues from Global Clients were $543.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $39.9 million, or 7.9%, from $503.3 million in the third quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by growth in our targeted verticals, including banking and financial services, consumer product goods, life sciences, insurance and high tech. Within these verticals, revenues grew primarily in our finance and accounting, core industry vertical operations, and transformation service lines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in net revenues from our information technology, or IT, services, primarily in our healthcare vertical and from investment banking clients in our capital markets vertical. As a percentage of total net revenues, net revenues from Global Clients increased from 81.5% in the third quarter of 2015 to 83.7% in the third quarter of 2016. 
   
 Net revenues from GE were $105.6 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $9.0 million, or 7.8%, from $114.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decline in net revenues from GE was primarily due to phase-outs of work we do for GE Capital due to continued dispositions by GE of GE Capital businesses. Net revenues from IT services delivered to GE declined by 6.6%, while net revenues from BPO services delivered to GE decreased by 8.2%. Net revenues from GE declined as a percentage of our total net revenues from 18.5% in the third quarter of 2015 to 16.3% in the third quarter of 2016.  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, GE divested certain businesses that Genpact continues to serve.  Historically, we have reclassified revenues from these divested GE businesses as Global Client revenues in each fiscal quarter beginning on the date of divestiture.  However, beginning with 2016, we will reclassify such revenue as Global Client revenue only at the end of each fiscal year.  We believe that this change will allow us to provide a more consistent view of the trends underlying our Global Client and GE businesses. If we had reclassified the revenue from such GE-divested businesses during the third quarter, Global Client revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 would have been $563 million and GE revenues would have been $85 million. 
   
 38 

Net revenues from BPO services were $525.  9   million, up $4  2.3   million, or 8.  7  %, from $483.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attr  ibutable to an increase in services delivered to our Global Clients, particularly finance and accounting, core vertical operations   and transformation   services. Net revenues from IT services were $12  2.9   million in the third quarter of 2016, down $1  1.3   milli  on, or   8.4  %, from $134.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 due to a decline in IT services engagements from Global Clients in the   investment banking   and healthcare industries  .  
   
 Net revenues from BPO services as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 81.1% in the third quarter of 2016 from 78.3% in the third quarter of 2015 with a corresponding decline in the percentage of total net revenues attributable to IT services .  
 Cost of revenue and gross margin . The following table sets forth the components of our cost of revenue and our resulting gross margin:  

Cost of revenue was $392.4 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $16.6 million, or 4.4%, from the third quarter of 2015. Wage inflation, an increase in infrastructure expenses, an increase in our operational headcount and lower headcount utilization on billable projects due to a decline in IT services engagements in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 all contributed to the increase in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by improved operational efficiencies, a reduction in travel, IT and stock-based compensation expenses, and favorable foreign exchange, primarily the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange fluctuations cause gains and losses on our foreign currency hedges and have a translation impact when we convert our non-U.S. dollar income statement items to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. 
 Our gross margin increased marginally from 39.2% in the third quarter of 2015 to 39.5% in the third quarter of 2016 due to the factors described above.  
 Personnel expenses . Personnel expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 41.6%, unchanged from the third quarter of 2015. Personnel expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $269.8 million, up $12.5 million, or 4.9%, from the third quarter of 2015. Personnel expenses increased primarily due to wage inflation, an approximately 4,300-person, or 7.2%, increase in our operational headcount and lower headcount utilization on billable projects due to a decline in IT services engagements in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by improved operational efficiencies, lower stock-based compensation expense due to a change in the probability of achievement of the performance conditions for the performance units granted in the second quarter of 2016, and favorable foreign exchange.   
 Operational expenses.  Operational expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased marginally from 17.3% in the third quarter of 2015 to 17.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Operational expenses were $106.6 million, up $4.8 million, or 4.6%, from the third quarter of 2015. Operational expenses increased primarily due to higher infrastructure expenses in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase in operational expenses was partially offset by lower travel and IT expenses in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 and favorable foreign exchange.   
 Depreciation and amortization expenses . Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 1.9% in the third quarter of 2015 to 1.7% in the third quarter of 2016. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $11.9 million, down $0.7 million, or 6.1%, from the third quarter of 2015. This marginal decrease was primarily due to an increase in fully depreciated assets since the third quarter of 2015 and favorable foreign exchange.    
 39 

Selling, general and administrative expenses  . The following table sets forth the compone  nts of our selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses:  

SG A expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 23.4% in the third quarter of 2015 to 24.2% in the third quarter of 2016. SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $157.0 million, up $12.2 million, or 8.5%, from the third quarter of 2015. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were approximately 6.6%, unchanged from the third quarter of 2015. SG A expenses increased primarily due to investments in domain expertise and digital and analytics capabilities, wage inflation and a reserve for doubtful receivables in the third quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower travel expenses, lower stock-based compensation expense, lower fees for professional services, and favorable foreign exchange, primarily the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
 Personnel expenses.  As a percentage of total net revenues, personnel expenses increased from 16.8% in the third quarter of 2015 to 18.0% in the third quarter of 2016. Personnel expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $117.0 million, up $13.4 million, or 12.9%, from the third quarter of 2015. The increase is primarily due to wage inflation and a 5.0% increase in our sales-team personnel expenses as a result of investments in domain expertise and digital and analytics capabilities in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense due to a change in the probability of achievement of the performance conditions for the performance units granted in the second quarter of 2016 and by favorable foreign exchange.   
 Operational expenses.  As a percentage of total net revenues, operational expenses decreased from 6.3% in the third quarter of 2016 to 5.8% in the third quarter of 2016. Operational expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $37.6 million, down $1.2 million, or 3.1%, from the third quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower travel expenses, lower fees for professional services and favorable foreign exchange in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for doubtful receivables.   
 Depreciation and amortization.  As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses were 0.4%, unchanged from the third quarter of 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $2.3 million, up $0.1 million, or 2.8%, from the third quarter of 2015. This marginal increase was primarily due to the expansion of certain existing facilities in India and was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.  
 Amortization of acquired intangibles.  Non-cash charges on account of the amortization of acquired intangibles were $7.1 million, down $0.1 million, or 1.3%, from the third quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in the amortization expense relating to a 2014 acquisition.  
 Other operating (income) expense,  net. The following table sets forth the components of other operating (income) expense, net:  

40 

Other operating   expense, net of income, was $5.1   million in the   third quarter of 2016, up $2.4   million   from $2.7 million in the third   quarter of 2015.   This increase is primarily due to a $5.4 million non-recurring charge in the third   quarter of 2016  ,   which charge we discuss in Note 10  Goodwill and intangible assets  under Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  above,   compared to   a   $10.7 million   non-recurring charge   in the third quarter of 2015 relating to an intangible asset.   The 2015 charge   was partially offset   by   a $7.3   million gain in the   third quarter of 2015   due to changes in the fair value of earn-out consideration payable   by the Company   in connection with certain acquisitions.   No such gains were recognized in third quart  er of 2016.     
 Income from operations.  As a result of the foregoing factors, as a percentage of total net revenues, income from operations decreased from 14.1% in the third quarter of 2015 to 13.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Income from operations decreased by $0.2 million to $87.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2015.   
 Foreign exchange gains (losses), net.  Foreign exchange gains (losses), net represents the impact of the re-measurement of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities and related foreign exchange contracts. We recorded a net foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to a $4.2 million gain in the third quarter of 2015. The loss in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily a result of the appreciation of the Indian rupee and the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Our net foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2015 of $4.2 million was primarily due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during that quarter.  
 Interest income (expense),  net. The following table sets forth the components of interest income (expense), net:  

Our net interest expense was $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $2.0 million from $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower interest income in the third quarter of 2016 due to lower account balances in jurisdictions in which we earn higher interest rates and higher interest expense in the third quarter of 2016, which was primarily the result of (i) higher interest rates on outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016, (ii) higher drawdown on our revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, and (iii) interest on interest rate swaps which we entered into in 2016. The weighted average rate of interest on our debt increased from 1.8% in the third quarter of 2015 to 2.3%, including interest on interest rate swaps in the third quarter of 2016. 
 Other income (expense), net.  Our net other income was $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $4.8 million from $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to a $5.2 million gain on the divestiture of our cloud-hosted technology platform for the Indian rural banking sector in the third quarter of 2016.  
 Equity-method investment activity, net.  Equity-method investment activity, net in the third quarter of 2016 primarily represents our $2.1 million share of loss, compared to our $3.4 million share of loss in the third quarter of 2015, from our non-consolidated affiliate, Markit Genpact KYC Services Limited, a U.K.-based joint venture with Markit Group Limited formed in 2014.  
 Income tax expense.  Our income tax expense was $17.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $1.0 million from $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing an effective tax rate, or ETR, of 20.0%, compared to 21.1% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in our ETR is primarily due to certain discrete items, including the reversal of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of our income.  
 Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest .     Redeemable     non-controlling interest primarily refers to the profit or loss associated with the non-controlling interest in the operations of SSE in the third quarter of 2016, which we discuss in Note 3  Business acquisitions  under Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  above.   
 Net income attributable to Genpact Limited common shareholders.  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income attributable to Genpact Limited common shareholders as a percentage of total net revenues was 10.6% in the third quarter of 2016, down from 11.0% in the third quarter of 2015. Net income attributable to Genpact Limited common shareholders was $68.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, up $0.7 million from $68.1 million in the third quarter of 2015.

Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 201  6 Compared to the Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 2015  
 Net revenues.  Our net revenues were $1,889.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $74.5 million, or 4.1%, from $1,814.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The growth in net revenues was primarily driven by an increase in BPO services delivered to our Global Clients. Adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily changes in the values of the Australian dollar, U.K. pound sterling and euro against the U.S. dollar, which had an adverse impact on our net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net revenues grew by 5.9% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. We provide information about our revenue on a constant currency basis so that our revenue may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Total net revenues on a constant currency basis are calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates and hedging gains/losses.   
 Our average headcount increased by 7.4% to approximately 71,800 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately 66,800 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net revenues from Global Clients were $1,566.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $95.1 million, or 6.5%, from $1,471.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by growth in our targeted verticals, including consumer product goods, high tech, banking and financial services, life sciences and insurance. Within these verticals, the growth in revenues was primarily attributable to our finance and accounting, core industry vertical operations, and transformation service lines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in net revenues from our information technology, or IT, services, primarily in our healthcare vertical and from investment banking clients in our capital markets vertical. As a percentage of total net revenues, net revenues from Global Clients increased from 81.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 82.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 Net revenues from GE were $322.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $20.6 million, or 6.0%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decline in net revenues from GE was largely due to phase-outs of work we do for GE Capital due to continued dispositions by GE of GE Capital businesses. Net revenues from GE declined as a percentage of our total net revenues from 18.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 17.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Net revenues from BPO services were $1,523.1 million, up $97.1 million, or 6.8%, from $1,426.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in services delivered to our Global Clients, particularly finance and accounting, core industry vertical operations and transformation services. Net revenues from IT services were $365.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $22.6 million, or 5.8%, from $388.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a decline in IT services engagements from Global Clients in the investment banking and healthcare industries. 
 Net revenues from BPO services as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 80.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 78.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, with a corresponding decline in the percentage of total net revenues attributable to IT services .  
 42 

Cost of revenue and gross margin.  The following table sets forth the components of our cost of revenue and the resulting gross margin:  

Cost of revenue was $1,149.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $49.4 million, or 4.5%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Wage inflation, an increase in our operational headcount, related increases in travel and infrastructure expenses, higher stock-based compensation expense and lower headcount utilization on billable projects due to a decline in IT services engagements in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 all contributed to the higher cost of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These increases were partially offset by improved operational efficiencies, lower IT expenses and favorable foreign exchange, primarily the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. 
 Our gross margin decreased marginally from 39.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 39.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the factors described above.  
 Personnel expenses.  Personnel expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 41.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 41.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Personnel expenses were $788.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $38.2 million, or 5.1%, from $750.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The impact of wage inflation, an approximately 4,100-person, or 7.0%, increase in our operational headcount, higher stock-based compensation expense, and lower headcount utilization on billable projects due to a decline in IT services engagements in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to same period in 2015 contributed to higher personnel expenses. These increases were partially offset by improved operational efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange.  
 Operational expenses.  Operational expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were approximately 17.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unchanged from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operational expenses were $325.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $12.3 million, or 3.9%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Higher travel and infrastructure expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 contributed to the increase in operational expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operational expenses was partially offset by lower IT expenses and favorable foreign exchange.  
 Depreciation and amortization expenses.  Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues marginally decreased from 1.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 1.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $34.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $1.0 million, or 2.8%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This marginal decrease was primarily due to an increase in fully depreciated assets since September 30, 2015 and favorable foreign exchange.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses.  The following table sets forth the components of our SG A expenses:  

43 

SG A expenses as a percentage of total   net revenues increased from 24.4  % in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 25.  5  % in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016. SG   A expenses were $482.  3   million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $  39.6   million, or   8.9  %, from the   nine months e  nded September 30,   2015.   Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net   revenues were approximately 7.0  % in the   nine months ended Septembe  r 30,   2016,   marginally   up fro  m approximately 6.9  %   from the   nine months ended September 30,   2015.   Higher personnel expenses,   investments in domain expertise and digital and analytics capabilities,   fees   for professional services, increased travel expenses,   h  igher stock-based compensation expense,   a   reserve for doubtful receivables and the timing of certain non-recurring travel and related costs all   contributed to higher SG A expenses in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016 compared to the   nine months ende  d September 30,   2015. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange,   primarily the depreciation of the Indian rupee and U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar  .  
 Personnel expenses.  Personnel expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 17.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 18.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Personnel expenses as a component of SG A expenses were $343.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $26.4 million, or 8.3%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Wage inflation, investments in domain expertise and digital and analytics capabilities, and higher stock-based compensation expense resulted in higher personnel costs as a component of SG A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.  
 Operational expenses.  Operational expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 6.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 7.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Operational expenses as a component of SG A expenses were $132.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $13.4 million, or 11.2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Higher fees for professional services, increased travel expenses, a reserve for doubtful receivables and the timing of certain non-recurring travel and related costs resulted in higher operational expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.  
 Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 0.4%, unchanged from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $6.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $0.2 million, or 2.7%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This marginal decrease was primarily due to an increase in fully depreciated assets since September 30, 2015 and favorable foreign exchange.  
 Amortization of acquired intangibles.  Non-cash charges on account of the amortization of acquired intangibles were $19.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $2.1 million, or 9.7%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to decline in the amortization expense relating to a 2014 acquisition.  
 Other operating (income) expense, net.  The following table sets forth the components of other operating (income) expense, net:  

Other operating income, net of expenses, was $4.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $4.4 million from $0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $15.0 million gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $9.4 million gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, each of which resulted from changes in the fair value of earn-out consideration payable by the Company in connection with certain acquisitions. This gain was partially offset by an $11.2 million non-recurring charge in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which charge we discuss in Note 10  Goodwill and intangible assets  under Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  above, compared to a $10.7 million non-recurring charge in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 relating to intangible assets. 
 44 

Income from operations.   As a result of the foregoing factors, income from operations as a percentage of total   net revenues decreased from 13.8  % i  n the   nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 12.8  % in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016. I  ncome from operations was $242.7   million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $8.1 million from $250.7   million in the   nine months ended September   30,   2015.   
 Foreign exchange gains (losses), net.  We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $4.1 million gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the re-measurement of non-functional currency assets and liabilities and related foreign exchange contracts, mainly resulting from the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Interest income (expense), net.  The following table sets forth the components of interest income (expense), net:  

Our net interest expense was $11.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down $18.1 million from $29.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the accelerated amortization of $10.1 million in debt issuance costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The 2015 accelerated amortization was due to the refinancing of our credit facility in June 2015, which we discuss in Note 12  Long term debt  in Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  above. The $7.9 million decrease in interest expense is primarily due to (i) a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense due to a lower interest rate on our term loan in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, (ii) a $1.9 million decrease due to the unwinding of interest in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 on earn-out consideration payable by the Company in connection with certain acquisitions compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, (iii) $1.3 million in debt issuance costs and interest expense on the two short-term loans we obtained and repaid in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in the amounts of $672.5 million and $737.5 million, respectively, in connection with certain internal reorganization transactions, and (iv) lower interest expense on our revolving credit facility primarily due to a lower interest rate on our outstanding debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest on interest rate swaps that we entered into in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our interest income increased by $0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average rate of interest on our debt decreased from 2.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.1%, including interest on interest rate swaps, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Other income (expense), net.  Our net other income was $7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $4.9 million from $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is primarily due to a $5.2 million gain on the divestiture of our cloud-hosted technology platform for the Indian rural banking sector in the third quarter of 2016.  
 Equity-method investment activity, net.  Equity-method investment activity, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily represents our $6.3 million share of loss, compared to our $8.0 million share of loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, from our non-consolidated affiliate, Markit Genpact KYC Services Limited, a U.K.-based joint venture with Markit Group Limited formed in 2014.  
 Income tax expense.  Our income tax expense was $44.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $0.4 million from $44.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an ETR of 18.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from 20.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in our ETR is primarily due to certain discrete items, including the reversal of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of our income.  
 45 

Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest.   Redeemable non-controlling interest primarily refers to the profit or loss   associated with the non-controlling interest in the operations of SSE in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016, which we discuss in Note 3  Business acquisitions  under Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  above.   
 Net income attributable to Genpact Limited common shareholders.  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income attributable to Genpact Limited common shareholders as a percentage of net revenues increased from 9.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 10.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net income attributable to our common shareholders was $192.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $17.2 million from $175.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Information about our financial position as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 is presented below: 

Financial Condition 
 We have historically financed our operations and our expansion, including acquisitions, with cash from operations and borrowing facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2016, $391.6 million of the $419.1 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign (non-Bermuda) subsidiaries. $8.5 million of this cash is held by a foreign subsidiary for which we expect to incur a tax liability and have accordingly accrued a deferred tax liability on its repatriation. $113.4 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is held in jurisdictions where no tax is expected to be imposed upon repatriation. 
 Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we repurchased 2,884,964 of our common shares between October 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016 at a weighted average price of $23.59 per share for an aggregate cash amount of $68.1 million. 
 We expect that in the future our cash from operations, cash reserves and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance our operations, our growth and expansion plans, and additional share repurchases we may make under our share repurchase program. Our working capital needs are primarily to finance payroll and other administrative and information technology expenses in advance of the receipt of accounts receivable. Our primary capital requirements include opening new service delivery centers, expanding related operations to support our growth, and financing acquisitions. 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table: 

46 

Cash flows from operating activities.   We generated net cash from operating   activities of $  222.9   million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   down $  30.7   million     from $  253  .6 million in the   nine months ended September 30,   2015.   This   decrease   is primarily due to a $  51.5   million net change in our operating assets and liabiliti  es in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016 compared to the   nine months ended September 30,   2015, mainly driven by   (i)   higher upfront investments in certain large deals in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016, (ii)     a net   increase in   income tax  es     and   (  iii) higher payments     in the nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to accruals for certain sales an  d strategic planning events and   infrastructure repair and maintenance costs in the fourth quarter of 2015  .   The effect of these items on cash flows   was pa  rtially offset by a   $20.8   million increase in net income adjusted for amortization, depreciation and other non-cash items.   
 Cash flows from investing activities.  Our net cash used for investing activities was $95.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $17.2 million from $78.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment (net of sales proceeds) of $20.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, payments for acquisitions consummated in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $20.2 million higher than for acquisitions consummated in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by investments of $7.5 million in our non-consolidated affiliate, Markit Genpact KYC Services Limited, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from $13.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and proceeds of $17.6 million from the divestiture of   our cloud-hosted technology platform for the Indian rural banking sector   in the third quarter of 2016.   
 Cash flows from financing activities.  Our net cash used for financing activities was $156.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, up $3.8 million from $152.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In June 2015, we refinanced our 2012 credit facility, or the 2012 Facility, through a new credit facility, as described below in  Financing Arrangements.  In connection with our entry into the new facility in the second quarter of 2015, we paid $5.5 million in expenses and repaid $135.0 million, representing the amount we had drawn down under the 2012 Facility as of the date of the June 2015 refinancing. Also in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we obtained and repaid two short-term loans in the amounts of $672.5 million and $737.5 million, in connection with which we paid debt issuance costs of $1.0 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid $30.0 million of the term loan under our new credit facility and drew down $93.5 million (net of repayments) of our revolving credit facility to meet short-term internal funding requirements. Additionally, we recognized a $13.1 million excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No such tax benefit was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Proceeds from the issuance of common shares under stock-based compensation plans (net of payments) were $9.1 million higher and payments related to earn-out or deferred consideration were $1.2 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 than in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Share repurchase payments were $242.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $159.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Financing Arrangements (Credit Facility) 
 In June 2015, we refinanced the 2012 Facility through a new credit facility comprised of a term loan of $800 million and a revolving credit facility of $350 million. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, our outstanding term loan debt, net of debt amortization expense of $3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, was $776.5 million and $747.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, a total of $22.9 million and $116.0 million, respectively, of our revolving credit facility was utilized, of which $21.5 million and $115.0 million, respectively, constituted funded drawdown and $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, constituted non-funded drawdown. We also have fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities with banks, which are available for operational requirements in the form of overdrafts, letters of credit, guarantees and short-term loans. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the limits available under such facilities were $15.8 million and $15.2 million, respectively, of which $10.3 million and $11.6 million was utilized, constituting non-funded drawdown. For details on our financing arrangements, refer to Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
 For a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2  Recently adopted accounting pronouncements  under Item 1  Financial Statements  above and Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net),  in March 2016 and ASU No. 2016-10,  Identifying performance obligations and licensing,  in April 2016, which amend and clarify ASU 2014-09. These ASUs will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018, and allow for both retrospective and prospective adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of these ASUs on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.  
   In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which primarily affects accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The ASU will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018.  
 48 

Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing t  he impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases.  The core principle of the ASU is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from its leases other than those that meet the definition of a short-term lease. The ASU requires extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including with respect to significant judgments made by management. The ASU will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The ASU changes several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including (i) accounting and cash flow classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (ii) forfeitures, and (iii) tax withholding requirements and cash flow classification. The ASU will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments,  The ASU requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The ASU will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2020. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures. 
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  The new guidance eliminates the exception for deferment of tax recognition until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. The ASU is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures. 

Item 3.   
 
     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

 We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating rate indebtedness under our term loan. Borrowings under our term loan bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, but in no event less than the floor rate of 0.0% plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense which will, in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.  
 We manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps under which we receive floating rate payments based on the greater of LIBOR and the floor rate under our term loan and make payments based on a fixed rate. As of September 30, 2016, we were party to interest rate swaps covering a total notional amount of $438.6 million. Under our swap agreements, the rate that we pay to banks in exchange for LIBOR ranges between 0.88% and 1.20%.  
   
 For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, see Part II, Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4.   
 
     Controls and Procedures    

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
   Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company s controls and other procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is accumulated and communicated to our management,  
 49 

including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required dis  closure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company s Chief   Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company s   Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company   s periodic SEC filings.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 In making its assessment of the changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, management excluded an evaluation of the internal controls over financial reporting in respect of acquisitions made in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 3 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these acquisitions.

         Risk Factors    

 We have disclosed under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the other information that appears elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company.
