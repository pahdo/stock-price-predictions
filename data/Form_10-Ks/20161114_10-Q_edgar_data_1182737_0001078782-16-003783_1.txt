DAKOTA TERRITORY RESOURCES CORP  
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  
   
  Note 1 Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Dakota Territory Resource Corp. ( we ,  us ,  our , the  Company , the  Corporation ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in our annual report on Form 10-K, for the year ended March 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as reported in our annual report on Form 10-K, have been omitted. 
   
 The Company s absence of revenues, recurring losses from operations, and its need for significant additional financing in order to fund its projected loss in 2017 raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
   
  Note 2 Related Party Transactions  
   
 Effective October 1, 2005, we began paying a management consulting fee to Minera Teles Pires Inc., a company controlled by the President and director of the Company. The agreement provides a fixed fee of $10,000 per month which has been deferred until financing is obtained by us. Additionally, the agreement provides for a payment of $1,500 per month for office rent and expenses. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred approximately $69,000 in management fees and rent from Minera Teles Pires Inc. As of September 30, 2016, we owed Minera Teles Pires approximately $453,600 for management fees and out of pocket expenses. 
   
 Effective February 24, 2012, we began paying consulting fees to Jerikodie, Inc., a company controlled by our Vice President and a director of the Company. The agreement provides a fixed fee of $9,000 per month plus approved expenses. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred approximately $54,000 in consulting fees from Jerikodie, Inc. As of September 30, 2016, we owed Jerikodie, Inc. approximately $345,100 for consulting fees and out of pocket expenses. 
   
 On March 19, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Wm Chris Mathers to compensate Mr. Mathers as the Company s CFO and agreed to pay Mr. Mathers cash in the amount of $1,000 per month increasing to $2,000 per month on September 1, 2013 and to $3,000 per month on March 1, 2014. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $18,000 in compensation to Mr. Mathers.  As of September 30, 2016, we owed Mr. Mathers $79,000 for consulting fees. 
   
 On August 26, 2016 the Company issued a note payable in the amount of $25,000 to Minera Teles Pires Inc., a Company controlled by our President, for the purpose of funding ongoing operating expenses.  The note bears annual interest of 3% and is due and payable October 26, 2016.  This loan remains outstanding as of the date of this filing.    
   
  Note 3 Mineral Properties  
   
 On September 26, 2012, the Company was re-organized with North Homestake Mining Company.  With this re-organization, the Company acquired 84 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 1,600 acres known as the Blind Gold Property located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.   
   
 On December 28, 2012, the Company acquired 57 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 853 acres known as the West False Bottom Creek and Paradise Gulch Claim Group, the City Creek Claims Group, and the Homestake Paleoplacer Claims Group, all located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  The West False Bottom Creek and Paradise Gulch Claims were contiguous to the Blind Gold Property and have been incorporated into the Blind Gold Property. The purchase price was 1,000,000 restricted common shares valued at $0.15 per share, or $150,000.  

6 

On February 24, 2014 the Company acquired surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  Located immediately to the north and adjoining the Company s Paleoplacer Property, Mineral Survey 1706 was explored by Homestake Mining Company in the late 1980 s.   The Company is required to make annual lease payments of $8,000 for a period of 5 years, of which $8,000 was due upon execution of the agreement. The Company has an option to purchase the mineral property for $120,000. The annual lease payments are capitalized as part of the mineral property. 
   
 On March 3, 2014 ,  the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 565.24 mineral acres in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota.  The acquisition increased our mineral interests in the Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property acquisition, the Company purchased an additional 64.39 mineral acres located immediately southwest and contiguous to our Paleoplacer Property, including mineral title to the historic Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke Gold Mines.  The three mines were the last of a string of mines that produced ores from fossil gold placers derived from the Homestake Lode and are located at the point where the channel disappears under the cover of younger sedimentary and intrusive rocks approximately one mile north of the Homestake Open Cut source.  With this acquisition the Company consolidated and extended the Paleoplacer Property position to a distance extending approximately 3,100 feet along the south to north trend of the channel.  The purchase price of the mineral interests was $33,335.   
   
 The Company plans to commence an exploratory program on these mineral properties as soon as financing can be arranged. 

Note 4 Notes Payable  
   
 The following notes payable are unsecured and bear interest at 5% per annum. They are due on demand:

These notes were re-structured and combined on March 27, 2013 into a single promissory note payable (the  New Note ).  In conjunction with this restructuring, the President forgave accrued interest totalling $57,817 (recorded as an equity transaction).  The New Note is unsecured, has a principal amount of $265,000, and bears interest at 4% per annum. The Company will apply 10% of the gross proceeds from any equity financing in an amount exceeding $0.5 million (whether one or more transactions) from and after the date hereof to prepay principal and accrued interest.

  Overview and Organizational History  
   
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2002 under the name Lakefield Ventures, Inc.  In September 2012, the Company changed its name from Mustang Geothermal Corp to Dakota Territory Resource Corp, reflecting a change in business. The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties. 
   
 We are a mining exploration stage company engaged in the business of the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. Dakota Territory maintains 100% ownership of three mineral properties located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, including the Blind Gold, City Creek and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties, all of which are located in the heart of the Homestake District and cover a total of approximately 3,057 acres. We currently have limited operations and have not established that any of our projects or properties contain any proven or probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7. 
   
 On March 9, 2012 the Company entered into an agreement with North Homestake Mining Company to exchange common stock to affect the acquisition of North Homestake s gold exploration properties located in South Dakota. The Agreement was completed on September 26, 2012 and the Company concurrently effected a 10 for 1 reverse stock split.  The merger was recorded as a reverse recapitalization and the issuances of common stock were recorded as a reclassification between paid-in capital and par value of Common Stock.  North Homestake Mining Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 12, 2011. 
   
 On December 31, 2012, the Company completed an agreement to acquire 57 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 853 acres in the Black Hills of South Dakota in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, which was valued at $0.15 per share on the transaction date. 
   
 On February 24, 2014 the Company acquired surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  The property is located immediately to the north and adjoining the Company s Paleoplacer Property. 
   
 On March 3, 2014 ,  we completed an acquisition of approximately 565.24 mineral acres in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. The acquisition increased our mineral interests in the Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property acquisition, we purchased an additional 64.39 mineral acres located immediately southwest and contiguous to our Paleoplacer Property, including mineral title to the historic Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke Gold Mines. 
   
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful exploration and development of our property interests and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations.  The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 
   
   Current Plan of Operations    
   
 We plan on concentrating all exploration activities on our gold property in South Dakota. During fiscal year 2017, we will require additional new financing of approximately $2.0 million to carry out our planned exploration, none of which we have secured as of the date hereof. 

11 

Our planned exploration program will consist primarily of field and diamond drill programs.  Additionally, the budget and any use of proceeds covering any equity based financing would provide for the annual maintenance requirements for the Company s claims, leases, and concessions and our general operating needs. 

Our estimated working capital requirements and projected operating expenses for the next twelve-month period total approximately $2.0 million. Our estimated working capital requirements and projected operating expenses does not include any future debt obligations that may arise and payments to our consultants. Our current working capital will not be sufficient to cover our estimated capital requirements during the next twelve-month period; we will be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or through debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required capital or that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates.  
   
 Since we are an exploration stage company and have not generated revenues to date, our cash flow projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond our control, including exploration and development risks, competition from well-funded competitors, and our ability to manage growth.  We can offer no assurance that our expenses will not exceed our projections.   
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $2,109,000 and our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $3,717,000.  We had a loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $233,000. 
   
 During our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, we plan to spend approximately $897,000 for diamond drilling, $23,000 for field programs and $90,000 for assays, as well as approximately $691,000 for expenses related to exploration programs.  The timing of these expenditures is dependent upon a number of factors, including the availability of drill contractors.  We estimate that general and administrative expenses during fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 will be approximately $400,000 to include payroll, legal and accounting services and other general and other expenses necessary to conduct our operations.  
   
 We have no employees.  Our management, all of whom are consultants, conduct our operations.  We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next twelve-month period.  Given the early stage of our exploration properties, we intend to continue to outsource our professional and personnel requirements by retaining consultants on an as needed basis.  However, if we are successful in our initial and any subsequent drilling programs, we may retain employees. 
   
 We currently do not have sufficient funds to complete exploration and development work on our properties, which means that we will be required to raise additional capital, enter into joint venture relationships or find alternative means to finance placing one or more of our properties into commercial production, if warranted. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration and development or production on one or more of our properties and any properties we may acquire in the future or even a loss of property interests. We cannot be certain that additional capital or other types of financing will be available when needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable or acceptable to us. Our ability to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions as well as our business performance.

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates  
   
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements; Valuation of options granted to Directors and Officers using the Black-Scholes model.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures
