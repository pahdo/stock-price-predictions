You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this Report.         CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT        References in this Report to  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  or  ITUS  means ITUS Corporation unless otherwise indicated.               PART I     Item 1.                         Business.                             Overview                  We were incorporated on November 5, 1982 under the laws of the State of Delaware. From inception through October 2012, our primary operations involved the development of patented technologies in the areas of thin-film displays and encryption.  Beginning in October of 2012 under the leadership of a new management team, we recapitalized the Company, unencumbered the Company s assets, changed the Company s name and ticker symbol, relocated the Company s headquarters, and modernized its systems. In July of 2015, the Company s stock was accepted for listing and began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.         In June of 2015, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Anixa Diagnostics Corporation ( Anixa ), to develop a platform for non-invasive blood tests for the early detection of cancer. That platform is called Cchek      .  In July of 2015, ITUS announced a collaborative research agreement with The Wistar Institute ( Wistar ), the nation s first independent biomedical research institute and a leading National Cancer Institute designated cancer research center, for the purpose of validating our cancer detection methodologies and establishing protocols for identifying certain biomarkers in the blood which we identified and which are known to be associated with malignancies. In August of 2016 ITUS announced the renewal and expansion of our relationship with Wistar.      2       
       Table of Contents          In October of 2015, ITUS and Wistar announced favorable results from initial testing of a small group of Breast Cancer patients and healthy controls. One hundred percent (100%) of the blood samples tested from patients with varying stages of breast cancer showed the presence of the biomarkers we identified, and none of the healthy patient blood samples contained the biomarkers. Breast Cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and throughout the world.     In April of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek     early cancer detection platform with Lung Cancer.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among cancers in the U.S. and throughout the world, accounting for approximately 27% of all cancer related deaths in the U.S. and 19% worldwide. In September of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform with Colon Cancer. Colon Cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in woman worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million new cases diagnosed each year, and approximately 700,000 deaths. At the end of September 2016 through the end of October 2016, the Company made similar announcements with respect to the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform for Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Liver Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer. On November 15, 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform with six additional cancer types including   Appendiceal Cancer (cancer of the appendix), Uterine Cancer, Osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue), Liposarcoma (cancer of the connective tissue), and Vulvar Cancer (cancer of the vulva), bringing the number of cancer types for which the efficacy of   Cchek      has been validated thus far to fourteen.     Our Cchek      cancer detection platform measures a patient's immune response to a malignancy by detecting the presence, absence, and quantity of certain immune cells that exist in and around a tumor and that enter the blood stream. These types of cells and the tumor micro-environment have been the focus of recent ground breaking published and reported research in immuno-oncology, enabling the development of revolutionary immunotherapies used for treating certain cancer types. Instead of seeking to alter or boost the body's immune system and its ability to destroy cancer cells, as is the case with immunotherapy drugs, we have developed proprietary techniques and protocols for measuring the subtle immunological changes that occur in the blood stream during tumor development. Specifically, we seek to identify a subset of myeloid cells that we believe are diagnostic. These cells, often referred to as Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), are identified by specific surface proteins enabling characterization. We generally refer to MDSC s and other cells of the immune system which we believe can be diagnostic in nature as biomarkers.  Through our proprietary protocols, we have had early success and have demonstrated accuracy in detecting these biomarkers in the peripheral blood of biopsy verified cancer patients, and in distinguishing the blood of healthy patients from the blood of cancer patients. The goal is to establish Cchek  as a non-invasive, inexpensive, cancer diagnostic blood test that can reduce or eliminate the need for traditionally expensive, invasive, painful, and often inaccurate cancer diagnostic procedures which are currently in use.      3       
       Table of Contents          In each instance where ITUS has demonstrated the efficacy of its cancer detection platform, fresh (utilized within 48 hours) blood samples from biopsy verified cancer patients have been tested at Wistar using a variety of experimental methodologies and protocols. Such un-blinded, non-uniform testing is common during the initial development stage of new technologies and diagnostic tests. Blood samples from patients with differing severities of cancers (with some cancers such as Breast Cancer stage 0 to stage 4) have been tested, including samples from both pre-treatment and post-treatment patients. In addition, Wistar has also tested blood from healthy donors. A critical aspect of any cancer diagnostic is the ability to accurately distinguish patients with cancer from healthy patients. Based upon our encouraging early results, our scientists are working with Wistar to finalize protocols and methodologies for identifying and classifying the immunologic biomarkers that are the foundation for our Cchek      early cancer detection platform. Although our scientists, working in collaboration with Wistar, will continue to improve our processes and methodologies to achieve maximum performance, we expect our testing to become more uniform over time, and to eventually test patient samples in a double blinded manner. While studies comparing biopsy verified cancer patients have been compared to healthy donors, we have not yet evaluated benign conditions such as non-malignant neoplasias, systemic inflammatory conditions, infections, and other potential conditions that impact or may impact the immune system. Such testing will be necessary for regulatory approval.     Based upon and following the results of the more extensive clinical study, we will determine what further studies are necessary and whether and when to begin the process of seeking regulatory approval for a cancer screening test or confirmatory diagnostic test based upon our Cchek      technology. One manner of seeking regulatory approval is to have a lab certified to run our cancer tests pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 ( CLIA ). Among other things, CLIA requires clinical laboratories that perform diagnostic testing to be certified by the state in which the lab is located, as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If we seek regulatory approval pursuant to CLIA, only those laboratories that are certified under CLIA to run our diagnostic test would be able to process test samples. CLIA certification may or may not require additional studies. We could seek to establish our own CLIA certified laboratory to run the diagnostic tests, or we could potentially contract with an existing CLIA certified lab, and seek to have that laboratory certified to run our diagnostic test.         Another manner of obtaining regulatory approval would be to seek to have Cchek  approved by The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) pursuant to what are commonly referred to as either the 510(K) process, or the Premarket Application ( PMA ) process. The appropriate pathway for FDA approval would depend upon a variety of factors, including the intended use of the test, and the risks associated with such use. FDA approval can take several years and would entail additional clinical studies.         The decision of whether and when to seek CLIA certification or FDA approval of a diagnostic test or tests utilizing our Cchek      technology will be dependent on a variety of factors, including the results from more extensive clinical studies, the capital requirements of each approval process, the landscape for competitive diagnostic testing, and the time and resources required by each approval process. It is possible that we may seek to have one or more diagnostic tests approved via CLIA certification, and other diagnostic test or tests approved by the FDA, or that we may seek simultaneous FDA approval and CLIA certification of a particular diagnostic test or tests.         4       
       Table of Contents              Over the next several quarters, we expect Cchek  to be the primary focus of the Company. As part of our legacy operations, the Company remains engaged in limited patent licensing activities in the area of encrypted audio/video conference calling. We do not expect these activities to be a significant part of the Company s ongoing operations.         Over the past several quarters, our revenue has been derived from technology licensing and the sale of patented technologies, including in connection with the settlement of litigation. In addition to Anixa, the Company may make investments in and form new companies to develop additional emerging technologies.           Preliminary Biomarker Results                                      On December 7, 2016 we announced the     preliminary results from our Cchek      cancer patient efficacy study. Using our most recent protocols and methods for measuring a patients  immunological response to a malignancy, the Company achieved Sensitivity of 92% and Specificity of 92% for 88 patient samples, including 54 samples from patients with multiple types and severities of cancer, and 34 healthy patients.      During the initial phase of the study, which involved multiple experimental protocols and techniques for measuring immunological responses, the Company reviewed and analyzed data from a total of 315 patient samples, including 228 patients with varying stages of cancer, as well as blood samples from 87 healthy donors.                        Patient samples representing 14 different types of cancer including  Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Liver Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Appendiceal Cancer (cancer of the appendix), Uterine Cancer, Osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue), Liposarcoma (cancer of the connective tissue), and Vulvar Cancer (cancer of the Vulva) were included in the study. The study included samples from patients with early and late stage, biopsy-verified, drug-na ve (before therapy) tumors, as well as biopsy-verified, refractory (unresponsive to attempted chemotherapy) tumors.                       Sensitivity and specificity are scientific measurements commonly used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test, where sensitivity measures how good a test is at identifying people with a particular disease, and specificity measures how good a test is at identifying people without the disease. Although published results vary widely,  established diagnostic tests such as Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) , which is used by other companies to screen for Lung Cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 93% and specificity of approximately 73%, the Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) test, which is used by other companies to screen for prostate cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 21% and specificity of approximately 91%, and Mammography, used by other companies to screen for breast cancer and considered to be the  gold standard  for breast cancer screening, has reported sensitivity as low as approximately 68% and specificity as low as approximately 75%. As these results indicate, current diagnostic testing is hampered by low sensitivity, low specificity or both, meaning that the tests miss a substantial portion of the cancers they are supposed to detect, or miss-diagnose a large number of healthy patients as having cancer. There is currently no inexpensive, non-invasive, diagnostic test that excels in both sensitivity and specificity.  Our preliminary results, while extremely promising, will have to be confirmed in blinded clinical studies of sufficient size before we can seek marketing approval for  Cchek     from the FDA.                      Initial samples in our study were tested utilizing immunostaining and fluorescent microscopic imaging. While results were promising, subjectivity in interpreting the imaging results together with labor intensive and time consuming sample processing hampered the commercial viability of this approach. Subsequently, patient samples were analyzed using flow cytometry, enabling more efficient processing and analysis. In addition, ITUS is developing a software application using a proprietary neural network, which currently relies on up to 13 quantitative parameters to analyze test results. This approach, which is highly data intensive and requires substantial computer processing power to develop, results in a test which can be performed using a desktop computer.  An initial version of our neural network, which was trained to distinguish between the immunological responses from cancer patients and healthy patients, was responsible for the sensitivity and specificity results reported above. The Company expects to continue to improve its protocols, continue to upgrade its neural network-software by increasing the number of patient samples used to train the software and expanding the range of markers, increasing the data resolution, and enhancing the architecture of the software, which may enable better results.                      Related to our collaborative research agreement, the Company and/or Wistar currently have collaborations with doctors from University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, The Helen F. Graham Cancer Center and Research Institute at Christiana Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, and Virtua Health System in southern New Jersey. In most cases, patients from participating doctors at these healthcare institutions who are beginning or in some cases, continuing cancer treatment are asked to consent to have an additional tube of blood drawn for the purpose of participating in the   Cchek      patients efficacy trials. Because the number of cancer patients treated by these hospitals varies over time, and the decision whether to participate in the Cchek      patient studies is ultimately at the discretion of the patient, it is difficult to predict the number of patient samples that we will receive in any given week, or during any given month. ITUS is currently in discussions with additional doctors and healthcare providers about providing blood samples for our patient efficacy trials, and the Company has capacity available to process an additional quantity of samples. With the addition of these new sources of patient samples, the Company expects to process enough samples and generate enough data to begin its regulatory discussions in the next 6 to 12 month period.            The Market                       There are four primary markets for a cancer diagnostic test: screening, confirmatory testing, treatment monitoring, and recurrence testing.                        Screening occurs when asymptomatic people are tested for indications of cancer. Examples of existing screening tests include the mammogram for Breast Cancer, Low Dose Tomography testing for Lung Cancer, and colonoscopy for Colon Cancer. All screening tests have their strengths and weaknesses, and for many cancers there are currently no recommended screening tests available.          5          
 
    Table of Contents                          Confirmatory testing is used to confirm the results of a screening test. In certain instances, existing confirmatory testing can be invasive, painful, expensive, and have relatively high risks of complications. For example, a positive mammogram is often followed up with additional imaging, which can lead to a biopsy during which a needle is inserted into the breast to sample suspicious tissue or lesions. For Lung Cancer, existing confirmatory diagnostics include bronchoscopies, during which a flexible tube is inserted through the nose or mouth and into the lung, and needle biopsies, during which a long needle is inserted between the ribs and into the lung. One potential side effect a lung biopsy is a pneumothorax (commonly referred to as a  collapsed lung ), which has been reported to occur in approximately fifteen percent (15%) of needle biopsies of the lung. A pneumothorax can lead to other complications and sometimes requires extended hospitalization.  In addition to the potential side effects, biopsies of any sort can be extremely painful for the patient.                      Treatment monitoring includes follow-on testing to monitor the effectiveness of a specific regimen of treatment. For example, diagnostic monitoring testing may be used to monitor the effectiveness of a particular type of chemotherapy, to determine how the cancer is responding and whether such treatment should be continued.                       Finally, recurrence diagnostic testing is used for cancer survivors to test for cancer recurrence. According to statistics published by the American Cancer Society, there are currently approximately fifteen million cancer survivors in the U.S., sixty-seven (67%) of which were diagnosed with cancer five or more years ago. Most cancer survivors live in fear of recurrence, and limitations of existing diagnostics, including repeated exposure to radiation from imaging tests, and invasiveness and costs and pain from tests such as traditional biopsies, prevent cancer survivors from being tested as often as they would like.           ITUS s long term vision is to have one or more tests based upon the Cchek      platform to serve each of the markets identified above. At this stage, it is most likely that Cchek      will begin as a confirmatory diagnostic test for one particular type of cancer, but our strategy for entering the market place will not be finalized until we have completed our developmental testing and analyzed all of our preliminary data.           Competition            Background          Continuing scientific advances and discoveries, the ability to more quickly process and analyze large amounts of scientific data, and decreases in the cost of sophisticated equipment and technologies, have resulted in the potential for significant advances in cancer treatment, and in particular, cancer diagnostics. Cancer statistics gathered over the past several decades provide overwhelming evidence that the earlier that cancers are detected, the greater the survival rates. Up until now, doctors have primarily relied upon technologies such as imaging (x-rays, mammograms, CT Scans, MRI s, PET Scans, Ultrasounds) and biopsies and other invasive procedures for cancer detection and cancer diagnoses. In many cases, these diagnostic procedures were performed after patients exhibited one or more symptoms of cancer, at which point the cancer may likely no longer be at an early stage. Existing diagnostic technologies such as imaging have gotten better, and invasive diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies have become more accurate and less risky, and we expect these types of traditional diagnostic tools to continue to predominate the cancer diagnostic market for the foreseeable future.         6          
 
    Table of Contents              We believe that with advancing medical knowledge, improvements in equipment and technologies, and reduction in costs of new technologies, new types of cancer diagnostics will be created and new types of cancer diagnostic testing that will outperform many of the traditional diagnostic tests, eliminate many of the negative consequences of existing diagnostic testing, and ultimately predominate the cancer diagnostic market.           We have identified a class and subclasses of biomarkers that we believe are present in the blood of patients with malignancies, and are perfecting a process and methodology for detecting those biomarkers. The goal is to create a platform, Cchek      ,  that can be used to launch a series of simple and affordable blood tests that can be used to detect and monitor many of the most deadly forms of cancer, including lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others. It is unlikely that the Company will initially simultaneously launch tests for each of the cancers identified above, and that specific and individual cancer tests for each of the four markets identified above (screening, confirmatory testing, treatment monitoring, recurrence)  will be launched over time.         Statistics from The American Cancer Society indicate that one out of every two males, and one out of every three females that are born today, will develop some form of cancer during their lifetimes. With approximately 200 million adults in the United States alone, we believe that the market for new, non-invasive cancer diagnostic technologies and testing will be enormous, and that there will be sufficient demand to support many different technologies and tests.          Cancer Diagnostic Technologies          If successful, we believe Cchek      will have several advantages over existing diagnostic technologies. For example, repeated exposure to radiation from x-ray technologies, such as mammograms, has become an increasing concern for the medical community, causing authorities to re-evaluate the recommended frequency of such x-ray based tests.  Traditional biopsies are often impossible for some tumor based cancers depending on the location of the tumor, and are invasive, expensive, and painful enough to warrant only limited use for other cancers even when the tumor can be accessed. In addition, such biopsies are limited in their inability to detect the heterogeneity of many cancerous tumors, and the ongoing mutations that are often evident as the tumor progresses. False positives in existing testing such as the PSA test, result in otherwise healthy patients being misdiagnosed, and subject to unnecessary follow-on treatments and medical procedures.  Patient inconvenience, risk of side effects from anesthesia, and risk of other complications result in low patient compliance with otherwise effective cancer screening tests such as the colonoscopy.  These are just a few examples of the challenges with traditional diagnostic tests that we seek to eliminate with Cchek      .  This will be the foundation for the competitive advantages that we expect to have over existing diagnostic testing. We expect Cchek      will be utilized as a component of multiple diagnostic technologies and patient background information to diagnose and manage the patient s condition.         7          
 
                                                      Table of Contents          Many public and private companies have announced plans and ongoing research efforts to launch non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests and tools that can be used for non-invasive cancer testing. These companies include well established, and successful biotech companies, start-ups, and companies of all sizes.  Almost every bodily fluid, including blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and excrement, are being studied for biomarkers or indicators of one or more types of cancer. The term that has been used to describe the category of this type of non-invasive cancer diagnostic testing is  Liquid Biopsy .  In general, most of these companies are focused on identifying and analyzing one of three types of biomarkers: circulating tumor cells ( CTC s ), circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ), and Exosomes. Each of these types of biomarkers has their advantages and disadvantages, and we expect that tests incorporating these and other biomarkers will make their way into the cancer diagnostic marketplace.         ITUS believes that its Cchek      diagnostic platform has the potential for at least three distinct advantages over the types of biomarker tests referred to above. First, it appears that the biomarkers that we are using may be present in multiple types of and varying severities of cancers. As a result, we anticipate that Cchek      will become a platform from which multiple tests could be launched for multiple types of cancers. Most biomarkers are associated with and useful for only one type or sub-type of cancer. Second, it appears that the biomarkers utilized by Cchek      may be present in both advanced, and early stages of cancers. Third, we expect Cchek      to be significantly less expensive than the technologies commonly used for tests based on CTC s, ctDNA, and Exosomes.           Employees           As of October 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, we had seven full-time employees.           Other           Our principal executive offices are located at 12100 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1275, Los Angeles, California 90025, our telephone number is 310-484-5200 and our Internet website address is www.ITUScorp.com.

Item 1A.           Risk Factors.                              Our business involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, including the following risks and uncertainties:         8          
 
    Table of Contents           Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations             We have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future     .          On a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception.  As of October 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was approximately $151,165,000.  As of October 31, 2016, we had approximately $3,238,000 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and working capital of approximately $2,932,000. We incurred losses of approximately $5,016,000 in fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur material research and development expenses and to continue incurring significant legal and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations.  As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.              As a result of our current lack of financial liquidity, our independent registered public accounting firm ( auditors ) has expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a  going concern.            As a result of our limited working capital, historical losses and our current burn rate, our auditors  report for our financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2016, which is included as part of this Annual Report, contains a statement expressing substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a  going concern . Potential sources of capital include income from operations, debt, and the sale of the company s equity securities. Many factors impact our ability to generate capital including the results of our ongoing clinical trials, the price of our stock, the liquidity of our stock, factors that influence the capital markets, and the overall health of the U.S. and world economies.          Because Cchek     is at early stages of development, it is not likely that we will generate revenue from operations for the foreseeable future. In the event that we are unable to raise additional capital, the ongoing development of Cchek     would be materially and adversely impacted as would the continuing viability of the Company.         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.  In order for us to have sufficient capital to execute our business plan, fund our operations and meet our debt obligations over the next 12 months, we will need to raise additional capital.  Although we have been successful in the past in raising capital, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so in the future to the extent necessary to be able to fund our operating activities and debt obligations over the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.          We will need additional funding in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders      .           Based on currently available information as of December 7, 2016, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our activities and debt obligations for the next 12 months.   To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities, as well as net proceeds from the December 2014 AUO settlement, to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.    If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to continue to operate our business, we will be required to obtain more working capital.  We may seek to obtain working capital through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions where possible which would be junior to our existing Redemtion Debenture (as defined below). W  e cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.  If we do identify sources for additional funding,   the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities.  We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.    If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.         9       
       Table of Contents            Failure to pay our secured debt holder may result in a foreclosure.               On September 9, 2014, we issued 140 shares of Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate value of $3,500,000  (the "Series A Preferred") and a warrant to purchase 370,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  September 2014 Warrant ). The September 2014 Warrant expired on November 11, 2016.  Holders of our Series A Preferred had a one-time right to require the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred shares, which right was set to expire on November 11, 2016 (the "Redemption Date"). Under its terms, the Series A Preferred could only be redeemed from the proceeds of the sale of the Company s equity securities.  On November 11, 2016 the holder of all of our outstanding Series A Preferred exercised its right of redemption. On December 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the holder of the Series A Preferred setting forth the terms under which such redemption would take place (the  Redemption Agreement ) in lieu of paying the redemption from proceeds of the sale of equity securities. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, at closing the holder of the Series A Preferred will receive (i) $500,000 in cash,  (ii) a 12% secured debenture evidencing the remaining $3,000,000 amount to be redeemed, $1,000,000 of which is due on or before June 1, 2017 and the remainder of which is due November 11, 2017 (the  Redemption Debenture ), and (iii) a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock with substantially the same terms as the expired September 2014 Warrant at an   exercise price equal to 10% below the thirty (30) day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock at closing  . The Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the Company s assets and prohibits the Company from incurring any senior indebtedness   other than equipment financing in connection with the Company s business.            If we default under the Redemption Debenture, the creditor may seek to obtain a judgment against the Company for the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture and attempt to foreclose on assets of the Company sufficient to repay the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture. In the event of a default, if the Company is unable to re-negotiate the terms of the Redemption Debenture or raise sufficient capital to repay the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture, such default could have a material adverse impact on the ongoing operations of the Company.           The terms set forth in the Redemption Debenture may make it difficult for us to borrow additional funds in the future.           Other than trade debt, he terms of the Redemption Debenture prohibit us from incurring indebtedness that is senior to the Redemption Debenture.  This restriction may make it difficult for us to borrow additional funds from third parties. Additionally, the Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the assets of the Company which may prevent us from incurring additional secured debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt   such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.           Failure to effectively manage our potential growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results     .          Our business strategy and potential growth may place a strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and systems.  Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.         10       
       Table of Contents           Risks Related to Cchek                   Our cancer diagnostic business is  pre-revenue, and subject to the risks of an early stage biotechnology company.            Since the Company s primary focus for the foreseeable future will likely be our cancer diagnostics business, shareholders should understand that we are primarily an early stage biotechnology company with no history of revenue-generating operations, and our only assets consist of our proprietary technologies and the know-how of our officers. Therefore we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new business, in particular new businesses engaged in the early detection of certain cancers.  Cchek     is in its early stages of development, and we  still must establish and implement many important functions necessary to commercialize the technology.          Accordingly, you should consider the Company s prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their pre-revenue generating stages, particularly those in the biotechnology field. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a business with no operating history will face. In particular, shareholders should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:                       demonstrate the effectiveness of Cchek                      implement or execute our current business plan, or that our current business plan is sound;                   raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to fully effectuate our business plan;                   maintain our management team, including the members of our scientific advisory board;                   determine that the processes and technologies that we have developed or will develop are commercially viable; and/or                   attract, enter into or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners such as licensors of technology and suppliers.         Any of the foregoing risks may adversely affect the Company and  result in the failure of our business. In addition, we expect to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. At some point, we  will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be able to reach such achievements, which would have a material adverse effect on our Company.           We may have difficulty in raising capital for our cancer diagnostic business and may consume resources faster than expected.           We currently do not generate any revenue from Cchek      or otherwise and as of October 31, 2016, the Company only had $  3,238  ,000 in cash  , cash equivalents and short-term investments  . Therefore, we have a limited source of cash to meet our future capital requirements, which will include the repayment of the Redemption Debentures and may include the expensive process of obtaining FDA approval for Cchek       for each type of cancer for which we desire to launch a diagnostic test. We do not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to raise funds in the future, which would leave us without resources to continue our operations and force us to resort to the Company raising additional capital in the form of equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us. We may have difficulty raising needed capital in the near or longer term as a result of, among other factors, the very early stage of  our diagnostic business and our lack of revenues as well as the inherent business risks associated with an early stage, biotechnology company and present and future market conditions. Also, we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability to raise funds could lead to decreases in the price of our common stock and the failure of  our cancer diagnostic business which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.         11       
       Table of Contents           While our  Cchek          diagnostic technology has shown favorable results from initial testing, we cannot guarantee that these results will be replicated in future testing nor can we guarantee the success of the technology at all.          We have initially used  Cchek     to test the blood of small groups of individuals consisting of cancer patients and healthy patients and have reported sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 92%. While these preliminary results far exceed existing diagnostic testing, there is no guarantee that these results will be replicable when we test a larger group of patients or at all. If we are unable to consistently attain results that are necessary for commercialization of   Cchek     , our diagnostic technology will not have any monetary value and we will be unable to generate any revenue from this technology.          Even if we are able to attain results necessary for the commercialization of  Cchek         , our ability to commercialize the technology in the future will depend on our ability to provide evidence of clinical utility.         Our ability to successfully commercialize  Cchek      will depend on numerous factors, including whether health care providers believe that  Cchek      provides sufficient incremental clinical utility; whether the medical community accepts that  Cchek      has  sufficient sensitivity (there are no or very few false positives), specificity (detects the cancer the test is supposed to detect) and predictive value to be meaningful in patient care and treatment decisions; whether the cost of the test is reasonably priced and commercially viable; and whether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover and pay for  Cchek      and the amount that they will reimburse for such tests. These factors may present obstacles to commercial acceptance of  Cchek      .   To the extent these obstacles arise, we will need to devote substantial time and resources to overcome these obstacles, and we might not be successful. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of  Cchek      would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.        We are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility or any assurance that we will have adequate managerial, technical or financial resources to support the studies necessary to provide sufficient evidence of clinical utility of  Cchek     or to adequately differentiate our test from other diagnostic products in the manner, timeframe or cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate  Cchek     , we will not be able to generate the revenues and market growth that we seek. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of our products would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.        12          
 
    Table of Contents           Diagnostic test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize  Cchek          on a timely basis, or at all.          We have begun to devote considerable resources to research and development for  Cchek     , however there can be no assurance that  Cchek     will be capable of reliably predicting the occurrence or recurrence of any cancers with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful, or, even if such technology is clinically and commercially useful, that it will result in commercially successful products. In addition, before we can fully develop  Cchek     and commercialize any new products, we will need to:                      conduct substantial research and development;                   conduct validation studies;                   expend significant funds;                   enter into agreements and maintain relationships with third party vendors to provide third party blood samples;                   obtain regulatory approval (either CLIA, FDA or both); and                   establish or contract with the owner of a CLIA certified laboratory to process test samples.        Accordingly, our product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years, especially if the Company seeks FDA approval for each of its diagnostic tests. If  Cchek      should fail at the research or development stage, not produce sufficient clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product or not gain regulatory approval or if we should run out of cash to devote towards the commercialization of the technology or fail to establish agreements with necessary third party vendors,  we will not make it to commercialization and we will not generate any revenue from the technology.         If we fail to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our  Cchek             technology, and our ability to generate revenue and the viability of our Company will be materially impaired.         Commercialization of  Cchek     will require that we obtain either CLIA certification, FDA approval or both. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for  Cchek     , we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the technology which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.          Unless we obtain FDA approval for  Cchek         , we will be dependent on laboratory contractors for testing of patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of    Cchek       .          13          
 
    Table of Contents         To pursue the development and validation of  Cchek    , we will require access to test results obtained from patient blood samples. We have currently contracted with Wistar to provide these services. Unless and until  Cchek     receives FDA approval, we may elect to seek CLIA certification for one or more of our  Cchek      tests. Failure to receive FDA approval or CLIA certification would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and validate  Cchek      .            We will be dependent on third parties for the patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Cceck   .         To pursue our development and validation of  Cchek    , we are likely to need access, over time, to patient blood samples and such patients will need to consent to the use of their blood. As a result, we have made arrangements with Wistar and neighboring hospitals and medical practices to give us access to patient samples for the development and validation of  Cchek     .  In the event that we are unable to obtain patient samples, or access to patient samples becomes more limited due to changes in privacy laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information or due to changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain patient samples and associated information, our ability to pursue the development of  Cchek     may be slowed or halted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations         Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or the FDA or other federal, state or local agencies.         ITUS will need to seek regulatory approval in order to market  Cchek     .  The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively  CLIA ) are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified under federal law. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. The FDA regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. We may choose to seek FDA approval for one or more  Cchek      tests, opposed to seeking CLIA certification.  We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly, including FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests.       14            
 
    Table of Contents           Health insurers and other third-party payers may decide not to reimburse our  Cchek          diagnostic testing or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects and require customers to pay for the tests out of pocket.         In the United States, the regulatory process that allows diagnostic tests to be marketed is independent of any coverage determinations made by third-party payers. For new diagnostic tests, private and government payers decide whether to cover the test, the reimbursement amount for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Physicians may order diagnostic tests that are not reimbursed by third-party payers, but coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic product. Each third-party payer makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay, although many payers will follow the lead of Medicare. As a result, the coverage determination process will be a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific, clinical and economic support for the use of  Cchek     diagnostic testing to each payer separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If third-party payers decide not to cover  Cchek     or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from  Cchek     could be limited since patients who want to take the diagnostic tests would have to pay for it out of pocket. Even if one or more third-party payers decide to reimburse for  Cchek      diagnostic testing , a third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could reduce revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payers will cover  Cchek      diagnostic testing  or offer adequate reimbursement. We also cannot predict the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order  Cchek     tests if third-party payments are inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.         Whether or not health insurers and other third-party payers decide to reimburse  Cchek         , the technology may cost patients more than we anticipate.         We believe that our  Cchek      diagnostic testing  will significantly reduce the cost to patients of screening and confirmatory testing for certain types of cancer. If, however, the cost to utilize   Cchek     is more expensive than we anticipate, many patients and third-party payers may elect not to utilize the technology which would significantly impact our ability to generate revenue on the technology.         We operate in a competitive market and expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.         The clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We are aware of many different types of diagnostic tests available to detect cancer that are currently in use or being developed and many more types of diagnostic tests may be developed in the future. If we are able to successfully commercialize  Cchek     , all of these tests will compete with our product. If   Cchek      is more expensive than and/or does not have sufficient specificity, sensitivity or predictive value to compete with tests that are currently on the market, or if any other diagnostic tests that are under development, once successfully developed and commercialized, have greater specificity, sensitivity or predictive value and/or are cheaper than our technology, we may be unable to compete successfully with such products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.          15          
 
    Table of Contents         Furthermore, as the industry continues to expand and evolve, an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors may enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of diagnostic products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition,  Cchek      will compete with product offerings from large and well established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to sustain and grow our revenue.            If we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, our competitive position will be harmed.         Our ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability will be impacted by our ability to protect our  Cchek      cancer diagnostic technologies and other   proprietary discoveries and technologies. We expect to rely on a combination of patent protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and regulatory approvals to protect  Cchek      and any of our other technologies.  Our intellectual property strategy is intended to help develop and maintain our competitive position. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patent protection for  Cchek       and any other technologies , nor can we be certain that the steps we will have taken will prevent the misappropriation and unauthorized use of our technologies. If we are not able to obtain and maintain patent protection our competitive position may be harmed.          Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.        Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our   Cchek      cancer diagnostic technologies and other   proprietary discoveries and technologies   without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our   Cchek      cancer diagnostic technologies and other   proprietary discoveries and technologies  . Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third-party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing our   Cchek      cancer diagnostic technologies and other   proprietary discoveries and technologies  . However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.           We are dependent upon a few key personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect us.         Our future success of developing  Cchek     will depend on the efforts of ITUS s Executive Chairman of the Board Dr. Amit Kumar. We do not maintain  key person  life insurance on Dr. Kumar. The loss of the services of Dr. Kumar could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.           Risks Related to Legacy Patent Licensing Activities             In connection with our legacy patent licensing activities, we may not be able to license our patent portfolios which may have an adverse impact on our future operations.           We may generate revenues and related cash flows from the licensing and enforcement of patents that we currently own, from technologies that we develop and from the rights to license and enforce additional patents we have obtained, and may obtain in the future, from third parties.  However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to identify opportunities to exploit such patents or that such opportunities, even if identified, will generate sufficient revenues to sustain future operations.         16          
 
    Table of Contents            We, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us to certain material liabilities.           From time to time, we may rely upon the opinions of purported experts.  In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such opinions are made. By relying on these opinions, we may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.           In connection with patent licensing activities conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court that has ruled unfavorably against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney s fees, exposing us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.           In connection with any of our patent licensing activities, it is possible that a court that has ruled against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney s fees to defendants, exposing us or our operating subsidiaries to material liabilities, which could materially harm our operating results and our financial condition.           Our patented technologies have an uncertain market value.           Many of our patents and technologies are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.          Risks Related to Our Common Stock             The availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.           In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations, to pay down existing or then existing indebtedness, to pay for the development of our   Cchek      platform and for acquisitions of companies. We have and in the future may issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders' ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.         In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.         Any actual or anticipated sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.          17          
 
    Table of Contents            Delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.           Provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law ( DGCL ) and our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the  Certificate of Incorporation ) and by-laws ( By-Laws ) could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:                       Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;                    The authorization in our Certificate of Incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover; and                    Provisions in our By-Laws regarding stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders limit such rights to stockholders holding together at least a majority of shares of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our Board of Directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.     Together, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.           We may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.           Our reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, specifically as we continue to devote more of our resources towards our   Cchek      diagnostic technology. It is possible that in future periods, we will have no revenue or, in any event, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:         18          
 
    Table of Contents                        clinical trial results relating to our diagnostic technology;                     progress with regulatory authorities towards the certification/approval of our diagnostic technology;                    commercialization of our diagnostic technology; and                   costs related to acquisitions, alliances and licenses.       Biotechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.           The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:                       announcements of developments in the cancer diagnostic testing industry;                       developments in relationships with third party vendors and laboratories;                       announcements of developments in our remaining patent enforcement actions;                       developments or disputes concerning our patents and other intellectual property;                       our or our competitors' technological innovations;                       variations in our quarterly operating results;                       our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations of our financial results;                       a change in financial estimates or securities analysts' recommendations;                       changes in management's or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;                      announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and                       the timing of or our failure to complete significant transactions.         19          
 
    Table of Contents              In addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by changes in governmental regulations in the diagnostic testing industry and/or court rulings and/or other developments in our remaining patent licensing and enforcement actions. For example, if government regulators no longer allow for the use of diagnostic technology that has not been granted FDA approval (e.g. denying products that have only received CLIA certification), the time and cost to bring our technology to market will increase which will likely have an adverse impact on our stock price.          In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.           Our common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ Capital Market, however if our common stock is delisted for any reason, it will become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules which may make our shares more difficult to sell.           If our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will then fit the definition of a penny stock and therefore would be subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks.  The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock making it more difficult for investors to sell their shares.  The SEC s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.  The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction.  In addition, the SEC s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction.  The existence of the SEC s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices.           We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock which may adversely impact the market price of our stock.           We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.         20

    Table of Contents          General        In reviewing Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, you should refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes related thereto.         Results of Operations           Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2016 compared with Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2015            Revenue from Licensing Activities      In fiscal year 2016, we recorded revenue from licensing activities of $300,000 from two license agreements. In fiscal year 2015, we recorded revenue from licensing activities of $255,000 from six license agreements and $9,000,000 from AUO as described below. The license agreements provided for one-time, non-recurring, lump sum payments in exchange for non-exclusive retroactive and future licenses, and/or covenants not to sue. Accordingly, the earnings process from these licenses was complete and 100% of the revenue was recognized upon execution of the license agreements.     Revenue from Settlement with AU Optronics Corporation     We did not record any revenue from the settlement with AUO during the fiscal year 2016.  Revenue from the settlement with AUO was $9,000,000 in fiscal year 2015.  On December 29, 2014, the Company   and AUO entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  AUO Settlement Agreement ) and a Patent Assignment Agreement (the  AUO Patent Assignment Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company received an aggregate of $9,000,000 from AUO.  The AUO Settlement Agreement and the AUO Patent Assignment Agreement were entered into to resolve a lawsuit filed by the Company against AUO in January of 2013, in connection with the joint development and commercialization of two of the Company s thin-film display technologies.          Inventor Royalties and Contingent Legal Fees         Inventor royalties and contingent legal fees decreased by approximately $36,000 in fiscal year 2016, to approximately $111,000, from approximately $148,000 in fiscal year 2015. The decrease was due to the decrease in revenue from licensing activities.  Inventor royalties and contingent legal fees are expensed in the period that the related revenues are recognized.  The economic terms of patent agreements and contingent legal fee arrangements vary across the patent portfolios owned or controlled by the Company.           Litigation and Licensing Expenses         Litigation and licensing expenses decreased by approximately $3,395,000 to approximately $106,000 in fiscal year 2016, from approximately $3,501,000 in fiscal year 2015. Litigation and licensing expenses included approximately $3,298,000 of legal fees and litigation costs in fiscal year 2015, related to the settlement with AUO.        23          
 
    Table of Contents           Amortization of Patents         Amortization of patents was approximately $325,000 in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. We capitalize patent and patent rights acquisition costs and amortize the cost over the estimated economic useful life. During fiscal year 2016, we did not capitalize any patents or patent rights.         Research and Development Expenses    Research and development expenses increased by approximately $845,000 to approximately $1,556,000 in fiscal year 2016, from approximately $711,000 in fiscal 2015. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs in connection with the development of  Cchek     , including increased  employee compensation and related costs, other than stock option expense, of approximately $626,000 and increased costs related to our collaboration with Wistar of approximately $121,000.        Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses    Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $2,805,000 to approximately $2,710,000 in fiscal year 2016, from approximately $5,515,000 in fiscal 2015. The decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses was principally due to a decrease in employee stock option expense of approximately $1,272,000, a decrease in employee compensation and related costs, other than stock option expense, of approximately $552,000, a decrease in consultant stock option expense of approximately $484,000, a decrease in consulting and outside services expense other than stock option expenses of approximately $276,000, and a decrease in legal and accounting fees of approximately $224,000, offset by an increase in investor relations and public relations expense of approximately $198,000.         Interest Expense         Interest expense increased by approximately $68,000 to approximately $520,000 in fiscal year 2016, from approximately $452,000 in fiscal 2015. Interest expense in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 consisted of accreted interest on our patent acquisition obligation.           Interest Income          24          
 
    Table of Contents         Interest income decreased to approximately $13,000 in fiscal year 2016 compared to approximately $18,000 in fiscal year 2015, due to a decrease in funds available for short-term investments.          Liquidity and Capital Resources           Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.          Based on currently available information as of December 7, 2016, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our activities and debt obligations for the next 12 months.  Our basic monthly overhead expenses are approximately $300,000, excluding payments of principal and interest due on our Redemption Debenture in 2017.   To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities, as well as net proceeds from the December 2014 AUO settlement, to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.    If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to continue to operate our business, we will be required to obtain more working capital.  We may seek to obtain working capital through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions where possible and as permitted pursuant to the Redemption Debenture which   prohibits the Company from incurring any senior indebtedness   other than equipment financing in connection with the Company s business  .  W  e cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.  If we do identify sources for additional funding,  the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders.  Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities.  We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.    If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.  In order for us to have sufficient capital to execute our business plan, fund our operations and meet our debt obligations over the next 12 months, we will need to raise additional capital.  Although we have been successful in the past in raising capital, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so in the future to the extent necessary to be able to fund our operating activities and debt obligations over the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.         During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,382,000.  Cash provided by investing activities was approximately $1,503,000, which resulted from the proceeds on maturity of certificates of deposit totaling $3,550,000 which was offset by the purchase of certificates of deposit totaling $1,900,000 and the purchase of property and equipment of approximately $147,000.  Our cash used in financing activities was approximately $3,000, which resulted from a royalty payment of approximately $36,000 applied to the patent acquisition obligation liability, offset by the proceeds from exercise of stock options of approximately $34,000. As a result, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at October 31, 2016 decreased approximately $3,531,000 to approximately $3,238,000 from approximately $6,769,000 at the end of fiscal year 2015.         25          
 
    Table of Contents          In October 2015, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the    Sales   Agreement     ) with National Securities Corporation (     National     ) to create an at-the-market equity program under which the company could sell up to $10,000,000 worth of its common stock (the      Shares     ) from time to time through National, as sales agent.   On December 2, 2016, the Company terminated the Agreement with National.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements         We have no variable interest entities or other significant off-balance sheet obligation arrangements.           Critical Accounting Policies            The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly.         We believe that, of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 3  to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:                     Revenue Recognition; and                 Stock-Based Compensation      Revenue Recognition          Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability of amounts is reasonably assured.          Patent Licensing         In certain instances, our past revenue arrangements have provided for the payment of contractually determined fees in settlement of litigation and in consideration for the grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company.  These arrangements typically include some combination of the following:  (i) the grant of a non-exclusive, retroactive and future license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company, (ii) a covenant-not-to-sue, (iii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iv) the dismissal of any pending litigation.  In such instances, the intellectual property rights granted have been perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents.  Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we have no further obligations.  As such, the earnings process was complete and revenue has been recognized upon the execution of the agreement, when collectability was reasonably assured, and when all other revenue recognition criteria were met.        26          
 
    Table of Contents           Stock-Based Compensation          We account for stock options granted to employees and directors using the accounting guidance in ASC 718.  We recognize compensation expense for stock option awards over the requisite or implied service period of the grant.  We recorded stock-based compensation expense, related to stock options granted to employees and directors, of approximately $874,000 and $2,192,000 during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We account for stock options granted to consultants using the accounting guidance under ASC 505-50.  We recognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employee consultants during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, of approximately $-0- and $484,000, respectively.          As of October 31, 2016, there was unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements for stock options granted to employees and directors of approximately $1,139,000, which will be recognized in future periods upon vesting of the stock options.          Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected term.  If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of ASC 718 and ASC 505-50 in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.         Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This amendment updates addressing revenue from contracts with customers, which clarifies existing accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. Under the standard, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  This standard update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and are to be applied retrospectively or the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption, with early application not permitted.  In July 2015, a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new guidance was approved.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12 ( ASU 2014-12 ), Compensation   Stock Compensation. This amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period shall be treated as a performance condition. Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this update to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.        27          
 
    Table of Contents         In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ). This amendment requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period including interim periods, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and are to be applied retrospectively or the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. We do not expect this update to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ) to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This amendment requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. Adoption of this standard is required for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this amendment on November 1, 2016 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17 ) to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes. This amendment requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowances, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-17 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This is expected to increase both reported assets and liabilities. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. For public companies, the standard will be effective for the first interim reporting period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method.  The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.  The new guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election for forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.        28

Controls and Procedures             Disclosure Controls and Procedures           We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Vice President - Finance, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act.  Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President - Finance concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of fiscal year 2016.          Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting          Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide full assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.         Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016.  In making this assessment, our management used the criteria for effective internal control set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the  2013   Internal Control   Integrated Framework .  Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2016.         29          
 
    Table of Contents          This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to a permanent exemption of the Commission that permits the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016 has not been audited by our auditors, Haskell   White LLP.          Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.         Item 9B.            Other Information.                        Redemption of Series A Preferred          On September 9, 2014, we issued 140 shares of Series A Preferred having an aggregate value of $3,500,000 and the September 2014 Warrant to purchase 370,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The September 2014 Warrant expired on November 11, 2016.  Holders of our Series A Preferred had a one-time right to require the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred shares, which right was set to expire on November 11, 2016. Under its terms, the Series A Preferred could only be redeemed from the proceeds of the sale of the Company s equity securities.  On November 11, 2016 the holder of all of our outstanding Series A Preferred exercised its right of redemption. On December 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the holder of the Series A Preferred setting forth the terms under which such redemption would take place in lieu of paying the redemption from proceeds of sales of equity securities. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, upon closing the holder of the Series A Preferred will receive (i) $500,000 in cash  (ii) a 12% secured debenture evidencing the remaining $3,000,000 amount to be redeemed, and (iii) a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock.          The Redemption Debenture shall be paid in cash by the Company as follows: $1,000,000 of the principal amount shall be paid on or before June 1, 2017, and the remaining $2,000,000 of the principal amount shall be paid on or before November 11, 2017. Interest shall accrue on any unpaid principal of the Redemption Debenture at the rate of 12% per annum, payable in cash on the first day of each calendar quarter beginning 90 days after issuance of the Redemption Debenture, with all accrued and unpaid interest to be paid with the final payment of principal under the Redemption Debenture (regardless of such repayment date).   The Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the Company s assets and prohibits the Company from incurring any senior indebtedness  other than equipment financing in connection with the Company s business .            The warrant grants the holder the right to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock (such shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant, the  Warrant Shares ) at an   exercise price equal to 10% below the thirty (30) day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock at closing. The warrant expires on   November 30, 2021.  If there is not an effective registration statement covering the Warrant Shares, the warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis, otherwise the warrant holder must exercise for cash.            Pursuant to the warrant, the investor may not exercise its warrant if such exercise would result in the investor beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of our then issued and outstanding common stock.  A holder may, however, increase this limitation (but in no event exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding) by providing the Company with 61 days  notice that such holder wishes to increase this limitation.  In connection with this transaction, the Company granted the investor registration rights with respect to the Warrant Shares.            Termination of Sales Agreement          On December 2, 2016, the Company terminated its Sales Agreement with National. The Sales Agreement, which was entered into on October 2, 2015 between the parties, created an at-the-market equity program under which the Company could sell up to $10,000,000 worth of its common stock from time to time through National, as sales agent. The Company did not sell any securities pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The Company elected to terminate the Sales Agreement because it did not desire to pursue an at-the-market equity program.             PART III           Item 10.

Code of Ethics      We have adopted a formal code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.  We will provide a copy of our code of ethics to any person without charge, upon request.  For a copy of our code of ethics write to Secretary, ITUS Corporation, 12100 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1275, Los Angeles, California.         Nomination Procedures      On July 9, 2015, the Board established a nominating and corporate governance committee (the  Nominating Committee ). The Nominating Committee has a charter which will be reviewed on an annual basis by members of the committee and will be at all times composed of exclusively independent directors. The principal duties and responsibilities of the Nominating Committee are to identify qualified individuals to become board members, recommend to the Board individuals to be designated as nominees for election as directors at the annual meetings of stockholders, and develop and recommend to the Board the Company s corporate governance guidelines. In selecting directors, the Nominating Committee will consider candidates that possess qualifications and expertise that will enhance the composition of the Board, including the considerations set forth below.  The considerations set forth below are not meant as minimum qualifications, but rather as guidelines in weighing all of a candidate s qualifications and expertise.                      Candidates should be individuals of personal integrity and ethical character.                  Candidates should have background, achievements, and experience that will enhance our Board.  This may come from experience in areas important to our business,   substantial accomplishments or prior or current associations with institutions noted for their excellence.                    Candidates should have demonstrated leadership ability, the intelligence and ability to make independent analytical inquiries and the ability to exercise sound business judgment.         34          
 
    Table of Contents                       Candidates should be free from conflicts that would impair their ability to discharge the fiduciary duties owed as a director to ITUS and its stockholders, and we will consider directors  independence from our management and stockholders.                  Candidates should have, and be prepared to devote, adequate time and energy to the Board and its committees to ensure the diligent performance of their duties, including by attending meetings of the Board and its committees.                  Due consideration will be given to the Board s overall balance of diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences, as well as age, gender and ethnicity.                  Consideration will also be given to relevant legal and regulatory requirements.         We are of the view that the continuing service of qualified incumbents promotes stability and continuity in the board room, contributing to the Board s ability to work as a collective body, while giving us the benefit of the familiarity and insight into our affairs that our directors accumulate during their tenure.  Accordingly, the process of the Nominating Committee for identifying nominees for directors will reflect our practice of generally re-nominating incumbent directors who continue to satisfy the Board s criteria for membership on the Board, whom the Nominating Committee believes continue to make important contributions and who consent to continue their service on the Board.  If the Nominating Committee determines that an incumbent director consenting to re-nomination continues to be qualified and has satisfactorily performed his or her duties as director during the preceding term, and that there exist no reasons, including considerations relating to the composition and functional needs of the Board as a whole, why in the Nominating Committee s view the incumbent should not be re-nominated, the Nominating Committee will, absent special circumstances, generally propose the incumbent director for re-election.  Although we do not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying and evaluating potential director candidates, the Nominating Committee will take into account the personal characteristics (gender, ethnicity and age), skills and experience, qualifications and background of current and prospective directors  diversity as one factor in identifying and evaluating potential director candidates, so that the Board, as a whole, will possess what the nominating and corporate governance committee believes are appropriate skills, talent, expertise and backgrounds necessary to oversee our Company s business.         If the incumbent directors are not nominated for re-election or if there is otherwise a vacancy on the Board, the Nominating Committee may solicit recommendations for nominees from persons that the Nominating Committee believes are likely to be familiar with qualified candidates, including from members of the Board and management.  While the Nominating Committee may also engage a professional search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates, the Nominating Committee did not engage any third party to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating the Director Nominees.   We do not have a policy with regard to the consideration of director candidates recommended by stockholders.  Due to the size of our Company and Board, the Nominating Committee does not believe that such a policy is necessary.         Depending on its level of familiarity with the candidates, the Nominating Committee may choose to interview certain candidates that it believes may possess qualifications and expertise required for membership on the Board.  It may also gather such other information it deems appropriate to develop a well-rounded view of the candidate.  Based on reports from those interviews or from Board members with personal knowledge and experience with a candidate, and on all other available information and relevant considerations, the Nominating Committee will select and nominate candidates who, in its view, are most suited for membership on the Board.         35          
 
       Table of Contents          The members of the nominating committee are Dale Fox (Chairman) and Drs. Arnold Baskies and John Monahan.         Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert     On July 9, 2015, the Board established a separately-designated standing audit committee (the  Audit Committee ) established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Nasdaq Listing Rules.

Henry P. Herms          Options granted Mr. Herms on November 8, 2013 and February 18, 2016 provide for the vesting of the unvested portion of his options to be accelerated and such accelerated options to become immediately exercisable if Mr. Herms is terminated without cause or upon a change in control as defined below. The intrinsic value of options granted on November 8, 2013 would be $2,307, which was calculated by multiplying (a) 611 options (being the number of options granted to him on November 8, 2013 that would be accelerated) by (b) an amount equal to the excess of (x) our closing share price on October 31, 2016 of $6.35 and (y) the options  exercise price of $2.575 per share.

Under the 2010 Share Incentive Plan,  change in control  means:                      Change in Ownership: A change in ownership of the Company occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, excluding the acquisition of additional stock by a person or more than one person acting as a group who is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company.                      Change in Effective Control: A change in effective control of the Company occurs on the date that either:         o    Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; or         o      a majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board before the date of the appointment or election; provided, that this paragraph will apply only to the Company if no other corporation is a majority shareholder.     41

For this purpose,  gross fair market value  means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.         It is the intent that this definition be construed consistent with the definition of  Change of Control  as defined under Code Section 409A and the applicable treasury regulations, as amended from time to time.         Director s Compensation     There is no present arrangement for cash compensation of directors for services in that capacity.

In addition, each person who is a Director Participant and joins the Board after January 1 of any year, shall be granted on the date such person joins the Board, a nonqualified stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of common stock (or 16,000 in the case of the Chairman of the Board) pro-rated based upon the number of calendar quarters remaining in the calendar year in which such person joins the Board (rounded up for partial quarters).

        Table of Contents          INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OCTOBER 31, 2016      
      Additional information required by schedules called for under Regulation S-X is either not applicable or is included in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.            
 
      Table of Contents                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                To The Board of Directors and Shareholders     ITUS Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ITUS Corporation (the  Company ) as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.       In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.       The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has limited working capital and limited revenue-generating operations and a history of net losses and net operating cash flow deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.           /s/ Haskell   White LLP   HASKELL   WHITE LLP       Irvine, California December 7, 2016    F-1

      ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    1.          BUSINESS AND FUNDING     Description of Business    As used herein,  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  or  ITUS  means ITUS Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.   From inception through October 2012, our primary operations involved the development of patented technologies in the areas of thin-film displays and encryption.  Beginning in October of 2012 under the leadership of a new management team, we recapitalized the Company, unencumbered the Company s assets, changed the Company s name and ticker symbol, relocated the Company s headquarters, and modernized its systems.  In July of 2015, the Company s stock was accepted for listing and began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.         In June of 2015, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Anixa Diagnostics Corporation ( Anixa ), to develop a platform for non-invasive blood tests for the early detection of cancer.  That platform is called Cchek      .  In July of 2015, ITUS announced a collaborative research agreement with The Wistar Institute ( Wistar ), the nation s first independent biomedical research institute and a leading National Cancer Institute designated cancer research center, for the purpose of validating our cancer detection methodologies and establishing protocols for identifying certain biomarkers in the blood which we identified and which are known to be associated with malignancies.  In August of 2016 ITUS announced the renewal and expansion of our relationship with Wistar.  In October of 2015, ITUS and Wistar announced favorable results from initial testing of a small group of Breast Cancer patients and healthy controls.  One hundred percent (100%) of the blood samples tested from patients with varying stages of Breast Cancer showed the presence of the biomarkers we identified, and none of the healthy patient blood samples contained the biomarkers.  Breast Cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and throughout the world.         In April of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform with Lung Cancer.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among cancers in the U.S. and throughout the world, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer related deaths in the U.S. and 19 percent worldwide. In September of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform with Colon Cancer. Colon Cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in woman worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million new cases diagnosed each year, and approximately 700,000 deaths. At the end of September 2016 through the end of October 2016, the Company made similar announcements with respect to the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform for Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Liver Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer. On November 15, 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek      early cancer detection platform with six additional cancer types including   Appendiceal Cancer (cancer of the appendix), Uterine Cancer, Osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue), Liposarcoma (cancer of the connective tissue), and Vulvar Cancer (cancer of the vulva), bringing the number of cancer types for which the efficacy of   Cchek      has been validated thus far to fourteen.         Over the next several quarters, we expect Cchek  to be the primary focus of the Company.  As part of our legacy operations, the Company remains engaged in limited patent licensing activities in the area of encrypted audio/video conference calling.  We do not expect these activities to be a significant part of the Company s ongoing operations.         F-6

     During years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenue has been derived from technology licensing and the sale of patented technologies, including in connection with the settlement of litigation.  In addition to Anixa, the Company may make investments in and form new companies to develop additional emerging technologies.     AUO Lawsuit and Settlement                 On December 29, 2014,   the Company and AUO Optronics Corporation ( AUO ) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) and a Patent Assignment Agreement (the  Patent Assignment Agreement  and together with the Settlement Agreement, the  Agreements ) pursuant to which the Company received an aggregate of $9,000,000 from AUO.  The Agreements were entered into to resolve a lawsuit filed by the Company against AUO, relating to the Company s patented ePaper  Electrophoretic Display, and Nano Field Emission Display ( nFED ) technologies.                        Background          In May 2011, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the  EPD License Agreement ) and a License Agreement (the  Nano Display License Agreement ) with AUO (together the  AUO License Agreements ).  Under the EPD License Agreement, the Company provided AUO with an exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to its ePaper  Electrophoretic Display ( EPD ) patents and technology, in connection with AUO jointly developing EPD products with the Company.  Under the Nano Display License Agreement, the Company provided AUO with a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to its Nano Field Emission Display patents and technology, in connection with AUO jointly developing nFED products with the Company.          On January 28, 2013, the Company terminated the AUO License Agreements due to numerous alleged material and continual breaches of the agreements by AUO.  On January 28, 2013, the Company also filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against AUO and E Ink Corporation in connection with the AUO License Agreements, alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment, unfair business practices, and other charges (the  AUO/E Ink Lawsuit ).  In June 2013, the Company and AUO agreed to arbitrate the charges (the case against E Ink Corporation had been dismissed without prejudice) (the  AUO/E Ink Arbitration ).          The Agreements          Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, AUO paid the Company $2,000,000 in U.S. currency, net of any Taiwanese withholding taxes. The Settlement Agreement further provides that:                        the Company will dismiss the AUO/E Ink Lawsuit and AUO/E Ink Arbitration, with prejudice;                       the AUO License Agreements are terminated;                        AUO gives up all rights to the nFED Technology;      F-7

               for a period of two years, the Company agrees not to initiate (whether on its own or through a third party) any patent infringement lawsuits against AUO or its affiliates alleging infringement by AUO s or AUO s affiliates products or services, for patents owned or controlled by the Company as of the date of the Settlement Agreement.  Any potential damages for patent infringement will toll uninterrupted during this two-year period. The prohibition does not apply to patents acquired by the Company after the date of the Settlement Agreement; and                       each of AUO and the Company mutually released each other from all claims that either may have against the other in connection with the AUO License Agreements, including any claims relating to the ePaper  Electrophoretic Display and nFED patents and technologies.          Pursuant to the Patent Assignment Agreement, AUO paid the Company $7,000,000 in U.S. currency, net of any Taiwanese withholding taxes in exchange for the Company s ePaper  Electrophoretic Display patent portfolio for which AUO was previously the exclusive licensee, consisting of:                        10 active U.S. patents and 1 U.S. pending patent application; and                       103 expired and/or abandoned U.S. and foreign patents and/or patent applications.          In connection with the lawsuit and settlement, the Company incurred a total of approximately $3,604,000 of legal fees and litigation costs.         Funding      In October 2015, the      Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the      Agreement     ) with National Securities Corporation (     National     ) to create an at-the-market equity program under which it may sell up to $10,000,000 worth of its common stock (the      Shares     ) from time to time through National, as sales agent. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Shares, and may at any time suspend offers under the Agreement or terminate the Agreement. The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Company     s previously filed registration statement that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on September 18, 2015. As of October 31, 2016, no Shares have been sold under the Agreement.         During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was approximately $3,382,000.  Cash provided by investing activities was approximately $1,503,000, which resulted from the proceeds on maturity of certificates of deposit totaling $3,550,000 which was offset by the purchase of certificates of deposit totaling $1,900,000 and the purchase of property and equipment of approximately $147,000.  Our cash used in financing activities was approximately $3,000, which resulted from a royalty payment of approximately $36,000 applied to the patent acquisition obligation liability, offset by the proceeds from exercise of stock options of approximately $34,000.  As a result, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at October 31, 2016 decreased approximately $3,531,000 to approximately $3,238,000 from approximately $6,769,000 at the end of fiscal year 2015.

    Based on currently available information as of December 7, 2016, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our activities and debt obligations (Note 2) for the next 12 months.   To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities, as well as net proceeds from the December 2014 AUO settlement, to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.   If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to continue to operate our business, we will be required to obtain more working capital. We may seek to obtain working capital through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions where possible and as permitted pursuant to our existing indebtedness. W  e cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do identify sources for additional funding,   the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities.  We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.   If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.          The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. In order for us to have sufficient capital to execute our business plan, fund our operations and meet our debt obligations over the next 12 months, we will need to raise additional capital. Although we have been successful in the past in raising capital, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so in the future to the extent necessary to be able to fund our operating activities and debt obligations over the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.          2.          SUBSEQUENT EVENT            On November 11, 2016, the holder of all our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred ) with an aggregate stated value of $3,500,000 exercised its right of redemption to receive such amount from proceeds from the sale of the Company s equity securities.    On December 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the holder of the Series A Preferred setting forth the terms under which such redemption would take place (the  Series A Redemption Terms ).  Pursuant to the Series A Redemption Terms, at closing the holder of the Series A Preferred will receive (i) $500,000 in cash,  (ii) a 12% secured debenture evidencing the remaining $3,000,000 amount to be redeemed, $1,000,000 of which is due on or before June 1, 2017 and the remainder of which is due November 11, 2017 (the  Redemption Debenture ), and (iii) a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price equal to 10% below the thirty (30) day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock  at closing. The Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the Company s assets and prohibits the Company from incurring any senior indebtedness   other than equipment financing in connection with the Company s business  .           3.          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Basis of Presentation    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ITUS Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.       Revenue Recognition         Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability of amounts is reasonably assured.         F-9

        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
        Patent Licensing         In certain instances, our past revenue arrangements have provided for the payment of contractually determined fees in settlement of litigation and in consideration for the grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company.  These arrangements typically include some combination of the following: (i) the grant of a non-exclusive, retroactive and future license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company, (ii) a covenant-not-to-sue, (iii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iv) the dismissal of any pending litigation.  In such instances, the intellectual property rights granted have been perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents.  Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we had no further obligations.   As such, the earnings process was complete and revenue has been recognized upon the execution of the agreement, when collectability was reasonably assured, and when all other revenue recognition criteria were met.        Inventor Royalties and Contingent Legal Fees        Inventor royalties and contingent legal fees are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the related revenues are recognized.        Research and Development Expenses     Research and development expenses, consisting primarily of salaries and other direct costs associated with developing a platform for non-invasive blood tests for early detection of cancer, are expensed in the consolidated financial statements in the year incurred.     Fair Value Measurements     Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 )  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  In accordance with ASC 820, we have categorized our financial assets and liabilities, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as set forth below.  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.       Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:       Level 1 - Financial instruments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market which we have the ability to access at the measurement date.       Level 2 - Financial instruments whose values are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets.          F-10

  Level 3   Financial instruments whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the instrument.         The following table presents the hierarchy for our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2016:

      Our non-financial assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis include our patents and property and equipment which are measured using fair value techniques whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a condition of impairment exists. The estimated fair value of prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their individual carrying amounts due to the short term nature of these measurements.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        Cash equivalents consists of highly liquid, short term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.        Short-term Investments                At October 31, 2016 and 2015, we had certificates of deposit with maturities greater than 90 days and less than 12 months when acquired of $750,000 and $2,400,000, respectively, that were classified as short-term investments and reported at fair value.           Patents        Our only identifiable intangible assets are patents and patent rights.  We capitalize patent and patent rights acquisition costs and amortize the cost over the estimated economic useful life.  No patent acquisition costs were capitalized during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  We recorded patent amortization expense of approximately $325,000 and $325,000 during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Impairment        Long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. Should the analysis indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value and a corresponding charge would be recognized.        F-12          
    Table of Contents  
        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
         Intangible assets that are not amortized are reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company evaluates potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with its estimated fair value. Should the carrying amount exceed the estimated fair value, a corresponding charge would be recognized for the difference.        Income Taxes    We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.    Stock-Based Compensation    We maintain stock equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance and performance-based awards, or stock units to employees, non-employee directors and consultants.    Stock Option Compensation Expense         We account for stock options granted to employees and directors using the accounting guidance in ASC 718  Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ).   In accordance with ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of service based options and performance based options on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model.  For options vesting if the trading price of the Company s common stock achieves a defined target, we use a Monte Carlo simulation in estimating the fair value at grant date.  We recognize compensation expense for stock option awards over the requisite or implied service period of the grant.  With respect to performance based awards, compensation expense is recognized when the performance target is deemed probable.  We recorded stock-based compensation expense, related to stock options granted to employees and directors, of approximately $874,000 and $2,192,000, during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Included in stock-based compensation cost for employees and directors during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $393,000 and $2,093,000, respectively, related to the amortization of compensation cost for stock options granted in prior periods but not yet vested.  As of October 31, 2016, there was unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted to employees and directors, related to service based options of approximately $1,139,000 which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.        We account for stock options granted to consultants using the accounting guidance included in ASC 505-50  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  ( ASC 505-50 ).  In accordance with ASC 505-50,  we estimate the fair value of service based stock options and performance based options at each reporting period, using the Black-Scholes pricing model.  F or options vesting if the trading price of the Company s common stock achieves a defined target we estimate the fair value at each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation.  We recognize compensation expense for  service based stock options and options subject to market conditions  over the requisite or implied service period of the grant.  For performance based awards, compensation expense is recognized when the performance target is achieved.        F-13          
      Table of Contents        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS           

  We recorded consulting expense, related to stock options granted to consultants, during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $-0- and $484,000, respectively.  Stock-based consulting expense for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 includes approximately $-0- and $484,000, respectively, related to the amortization of compensation cost for stock options granted in prior periods but vested in the current period. As of October 31, 2016, there was no unrecognized consulting expense related to non-vested stock options granted to consultants.          Fair Value Determination            We use the Black-Scholes pricing model in estimating the fair value of stock options which vest over a specific period of time or upon achieving performance targets.   To determine the weighted average fair value of stock options on the date of grant, employees and directors are included in a single group.  The fair value of stock options granted to consultants is determined on an individual basis.  The stock options we granted during the year ended October 31, 2015 consisted of awards with 10-year terms that vest over one year, options with 10-year terms that vest over 36 months. The stock options we granted during the year ended October 31, 2014 consisted of awards with 10-year terms that vest over one year and options with 10-year terms that vest over 36 months, options with 5-year terms which vest immediately and options with 10-year terms which vest upon achievement of performance milestones.          The following weighted average assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015:         
          The expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.  We use the simplified method to determine expected term.  The simplified method was adopted since we do not believe that historical experience is representative of future performance because of the impact of the changes in our operations and the change in terms from historical options which vested immediately to terms including vesting periods of up to three years.  Under the Black-Scholes pricing model, we estimated the expected volatility of our shares of common stock based upon the historical volatility of our share price over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options.  We estimated the risk-free interest rate based on the implied yield available on the applicable grant date of a U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants.  We made the dividend yield assumption based on our history of not paying dividends and our expectation not to pay dividends in the future.         Under ASC 718, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.  Accordingly, if deemed necessary, we reduce the fair value of the stock option awards for expected forfeitures, which are forfeitures of the unvested portion of surrendered options.  Based on our historical experience and future expectations, we have not reduced the amount of stock-based compensation expenses for anticipated forfeitures.        F-14        
      Table of Contents  
        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      
   We will reconsider use of the Black-Scholes pricing model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate.  If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of ASC 718 in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under ASC 718 may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.        Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock     In accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share , basic net loss per common share ( Basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net loss per common share ( Diluted EPS ) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents and convertible securities then outstanding.  Diluted EPS for all years presented is the same as Basic EPS, as the inclusion of the effect of common share equivalents then outstanding would be anti-dilutive.  For this reason, excluded from the calculation of Diluted EPS for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, were options to purchase 3,086,472 and 2,672,471 shares, respectively, warrants to purchase 707,379 shares and 1,028,931 shares, respectively, preferred stock convertible into 739,958 shares.        Use of Estimates         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, determining stock-based compensation, asset impairment evaluations, tax assets and liabilities, license fee revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation lives and other contingencies.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Effect of Recently Issued Pronouncements        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This amendment updates addressing revenue from contracts with customers, which clarifies existing accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. Under the standard, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  This standard update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and are to be applied retrospectively or the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption, with early application not permitted.  In July 2015, a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new guidance was approved.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.        F-15

  In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12 ( ASU 2014-12 ), Compensation   Stock Compensation.  This amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period shall be treated as a performance condition. Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this update to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.          In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ). This amendment requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period including interim periods, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and are to be applied retrospectively or the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. We do not expect this update to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ) to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This amendment requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. Adoption of this standard is required for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this amendment on November 1, 2016 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17 ) to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes. This amendment requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowances, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Adoption of this standard is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-17 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This is expected to increase both reported assets and liabilities. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. For public companies, the standard will be effective for the first interim reporting period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election for forfeitures as they occur.  The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.        F-16

   Concentration of Credit Risks    Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents are primarily highly rated money market funds. Short-term investments are certificates of deposit within federally insured limits. Where applicable, management reviews our accounts receivable and other receivables for potential doubtful accounts and maintains an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. Our policy is to write-off uncollectable amounts at the time it is determined that collection will not occur.        Two licensees accounted for 67% and 33%, respectively, of revenues from patent licensing activities during fiscal year 2016. Three licensees accounted for 53%, 37% and 10%, respectively, of revenues from patent licensing activities during fiscal year 2015.        4.          ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES    Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following as of:         
  5.          SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY          Reverse Stock Split         On June 26, 2015, we effected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split (the  Stock Split ) of our issued common stock and preferred stock.  Each shareholders  percentage ownership and proportional voting power remained unchanged as a result of the Stock Split.  All applicable share data, per share amounts and related information in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively to give effect to the Stock Split.  As a result of the Stock Split, the number of shares of our common stock and preferred stock authorized was also decreased by the same proportion as the outstanding shares.        Common Stock Issuances    During the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we issued 10,833 shares and 11,600 shares, respectively, of common stock to consultants for services rendered, pursuant to the 2010 Share Plan.  We recorded consulting expense for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $31,000 and $46,000, respectively, for shares of common stock issued to consultants.      Stock Option Plans    As of October 31, 2016, we have two stock option plans: the ITUS Corporation 2003 Share Incentive Plan (the  2003 Share Plan ) and the ITUS Corporation 2010 Share Incentive Plan (the  2010 Share Plan ) which were adopted by our Board of Directors on April 21, 2003 and July 14, 2010, respectively.

              The 2003 Share Plan provided for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards and stock units to key employees and consultants.  The maximum number of shares of common stock in the 2003 Share Plan was 2,800,000 shares. The 2003 Share Plan was administered by the Stock Option Committee through June 2004, from June 2004 through July 2010, by the Board of Directors, from July 2010 through August 2012, by the Stock Option Committee, from August 2012 through November 2012, by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, from November 2012 to July 2015, by the Board of Directors and since July 2015 by the Compensation Committee, which determined the option price, term and provisions of each option.  The exercise price with respect to all of the options granted under the 2003 Share Plan since its inception was equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the grant date.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2003 Share Plan, the plan terminated with respect to the grant of future options on April 21, 2013.        Information regarding the 2003 Share Plan for the two years ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:

  The 2010 Share Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards and stock units to key employees and consultants.  The maximum number of shares of common stock in the 2010 Share Plan was initially 600,000 shares. On July 6, 2011, the 2010 Share Plan was amended by our Board of Directors to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock in the plan to 1,080,000 shares and on August 29, 2012, the maximum number of shares in the plan was further increased to 1,200,000 shares.  On November 8, 2013, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to provide that effective November 8, 2013, the maximum aggregate number of shares available for future issuance will be 800,000 shares and that on the first business day in 2014 and on the first business day of each calendar year thereafter the maximum aggregate number of shares available for future issuance shall be replenished such that 800,000 shares will be available. Accordingly, on November 8, 2013, January 2, 2014 and January 2, 2015, the number of shares in the 2010 Share Plan was increased to 1,957,000 shares, 2,225,400 shares and 2,569,400 shares, respectively.  In addition, on November 8, 2013, the 2010 Share Plan was amended to provide that on the first business day of each year commencing on January 2, 2014, each non-employee director of the Company at that time shall automatically be granted a 10-year stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of common stock (16,000 for the Chairman) that will vest in four equal quarterly installments. The 2010 Share Plan was administered by the Stock Option Committee through August 2012, from August 2012 through November 2012, by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, from November 2012 through July 2015, by the Board of Directors and since July 2015, by the Compensation Committee, which determines the option price, term and provisions of each option. The exercise price with respect to all of the options granted under the 2010 Share Plan was equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the grant date.  As of October 31, 2016, the 2010 Share Plan had 431,956 shares available for future grants.         Information regarding the 2010 Share Plan as of October 31, 2016 is as follows:

  In addition to options granted under the 2003 Share Plan and the 2010 Share Plan, during the years ended October 31, 2012 and 2013, the Board of Directors approved the grant of stock options to purchase 1,660,000 shares and 120,000 shares, respectively.        Information regarding stock options that were not granted under the 2003 Share Plan or the 2010 Share Plan for the two years ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:         
      The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable that were not granted under the 2003 Share Plan or the 2010 Share Plan as of October 31, 2016:         
            Re-Priced Stock Options          On January 28, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized management of the Company to re-price issued and outstanding stock options for all of the officers, directors and employees of the Company, at any time prior to February 16, 2015.  On February 5, 2015, management acted to re-price 2,184,125 issued and outstanding stock options (the  Re-Priced Options ) pursuant to the authority granted by the Board of Directors. The new exercise price of the Re-Priced Options is $2.575, the closing sales price of the Company s common stock on February 5, 2015.  All other terms of the previously granted Re-Priced Options remain the same.  The Company recorded additional stock-based compensation of approximately $297,000, as of February 5, 2015, related to this re-pricing.  This amount was determined to be the incremental value of the fair value of the Re-Priced Options compared to the fair value of the original option immediately before the re-pricing.         Preferred Stock        In May 1986, our shareholders authorized 200,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $100 per share.  The shares of preferred stock may be issued in series at the direction of the Board of Directors, and the relative rights, preferences and limitations of such shares will all be determined by the Board of Directors.  As of October 31, 2016, 140 shares of preferred stock had been designated and issued as Series A Preferred Stock.      F-20

        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   Series A Convertible Preferred Stock    On September 9, 2014, the Company designated 140 shares of the preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share, in accordance with the Certificate of Designation of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 9, 2014 (the  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ).  On September 9, 2014, 140 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $25,000 per share were issued in connection with the conversion of a Convertible Debenture due November 2016.        Ranking                   The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ranked senior to the Company s common stock, to all series of any other classes of equity which may be issued and to any indebtedness, unless the Company obtained the prior written consent of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock holder.           Redemption        At any time on or after November 11, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ), and upon at least 60 days prior written notice to the Company (a  Redemption Notice ), any holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had a one-time right to require the Company to redeem all or some of its shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (a  Redemption ) for cash generated from a subsequent sale of the Company s equity securities.  The redemption price being equal to the stated value ($25,000 per share) of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, (the  Redemption Purchase Price ).  Upon receipt of a Redemption Notice, the Company shall complete a sale or sales of its equity securities for the purpose of accumulating net proceeds sufficient to pay the Redemption Purchase Price.         On September 9, 2016, the holder of 140 shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock delivered a Redemption Notice to the Company requesting a redemption date of November 11, 2016 (it being understood by the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that the Company may only redeem shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the proceeds from the sale of the Company s equity securities). On December 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock to exchange the Series A Preferred Stock for a secured debenture, cash and warrants. See Note 2, Subsequent Event.           Optional Conversion        Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had the right at any time convert their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into such number of shares of the Company s common stock in such an amount equal to (a) the stated value of $25,000 per share of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, divided by the conversion price of $4.73, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock being converted.          The holder did not have the right to convert any portion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock if after giving effect to such conversion, the holder, together with any affiliate thereof, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.

        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
         The embedded conversion option had certain anti-dilution protection provisions which would be triggered if the Company issues its common stock, or certain common stock equivalents, (as defined) at a price below $3.55 per share.         Board and Observer Rights        Each holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right, upon 10 days' prior written notice, to designate one representative, reasonably acceptable to the Company, who shall be entitled to attend and observe meetings of the Company s Board of Directors in a non-voting observer capacity (the  Observer ).        Accounting for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock        The Company determined that the economic characteristics and risks of the conversion feature and the preferred stock instrument were clearly and closely related as equity instruments and accordingly, the conversion feature would not require separate accounting.   In addition, the redemption feature was contingent upon Series A Convertible Preferred Stock not being converted into common stock and upon the holder delivering a redemption notice to the Company.   Further, the redemption purchase price may only be paid from the proceeds of a subsequent sale of equity securities. Accordingly, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was accounted for as an equity instrument. Further, because the conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of $4.73 per share was less than the Company s closing stock price on the date of this transaction, the Company determined that the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contained a beneficial conversion feature. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded in additional paid-in-capital as a result of the Company s accumulated deficit .          Common Stock Purchase Warrants        As of October 31, 2016, we had warrants to purchase 10,000 shares and 10,000 shares of common stock at $9.25 and $13.875 per share, respectively, expiring on August 19, 2019, warrants to purchase 369,979 shares of common stock at $7.75 per share expiring on November 11, 2016, warrants to purchase 8,000 shares of common stock at $6.925 per share expiring on June 2, 2017 and warrants to purchase 309,400 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share expiring on July 15, 2019.    6.          COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      Patent Acquisition Obligations     As of October 31, 2016, we have incurred obligations due no later than November 2017 related to the acquisition of patents, which have a discounted present value of approximately $4,172,000, and which amount will be reduced by royalties paid during the period, if any.  The payment due in November 2017 is payable at the option of the Company in cash or common stock.  We recorded interest expense of approximately $520,000 and $452,000, respectively, for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, for the accretion of interest on patent acquisition obligations.  The payment due date of November 2017 may be extended for up to two years if any patent infringement lawsuit initiated by the Company is stayed because of any re-exam or similar proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

     Leases      We lease approximately 3,000 square feet of office space in Los Angeles, California pursuant to a lease that expires May 31, 2019.  The lease contains base rentals of approximately $11,000 per month with annual increases of approximately 3% and an escalation clause for increases in certain operating expenses.   As of October 31, 2016, our non-cancelable operating lease commitments for the years ending October 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were approximately $129,000, 134,000 and $80,000, respectively.  Rent expense for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $104,000 and $100,000, respectively.      Litigation Matters     On December 29, 2014, we settled our lawsuit against AUO which had been filed on January 28, 2013. For a more detailed description of the settlement with AUO see Note 1,  Business and Funding - Description of Business - AUO Lawsuit and Settlement .     Other than suits we bring to enforce our patent rights we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings other than that which arise in the ordinary course of business.  We believe that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.        7.          INCOME TAXES            Income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:     
      The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax asset, net, at October 31, 2016 and 2015, are as follows:

        ITUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       
  As of October 31, 2016, we had tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $79,428,000 and $1,110,000, respectively, available within statutory limits (expiring at various dates between 2020 and 2035), to offset any future regular Federal corporate taxable income and taxes payable.  If the tax benefits relating to deductions of option holders  income are ultimately realized, those benefits will be credited directly to additional paid-in capital. Certain changes in stock ownership can result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers that can be utilized each year. As of October 31, 2016, management has not determined the extent of any such limitations, if any.   We had New York, California and Pennsylvania tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $76,847,000, $4,849,000 and $841,000, respectively, as of October 31, 2016, available within statutory limits (expiring at various dates between 2020 and 2035), to offset future corporate taxable income and taxes payable, if any, under certain computations of such taxes.   We have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset due to our current and historical pre-tax losses and the uncertainty regarding their realizability.  The primary differences from the Federal statutory rate of 34% and the effective rate of 0% is attributable to certain permanent differences and a change in the valuation allowance. The following is a reconciliation of income taxes at the Federal statutory tax rate to income tax expense (benefit):         
      During the two fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, we incurred no Federal and no State income taxes. We have no unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2016 and 2015 and we account for interest and penalties related to income tax matters in marketing, general and administrative expenses.  Tax years to which our net operating losses relate remain open to examination by Federal authorities and other jurisdictions to the extent which the net operating losses have yet to be utilized.

Warrant to Purchase 500,000 Shares       ITUS CORPORATION   COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT       This certifies that, for good and valuable consideration, ITUS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (including any successor thereto with respect to the obligations hereunder, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the   Company  ), grants to  Adaptive Capital LLC  or permitted assigns (the   Warrantholder  ) the right to subscribe for and purchase, in whole or in part, from time to time from the Company Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares (the   Warrant Shares  ) of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the   Common Stock  ), at the purchase price per share $[___] (the   Exercise Price  ) at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time on the Expiration Date, all subject to the terms, conditions and adjustments herein set forth. The terms that are capitalized herein shall have the meanings specified in Section 11 hereof, unless the context shall otherwise require.       This Warrant (  Warrant  ) is being issued pursuant to the terms of that certain letter agreement, dated December 1, 2016, by and between the Company and Warrantholder.          1.       Duration and Exercise of Warrant: Limitation on Exercise: Payment of Taxes.          1.1.    Duration and Exercise of Warrant.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, this Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the Warrantholder by:       (a)       the surrender of this Warrant to the Company, with a duly executed Exercise Form specifying the number of Warrant Shares to be purchased, during normal business hours on any Business Day prior to the Expiration Date, and the delivery of payment to the Company of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares specified in the Exercise Form in the form of cash or certified or bank check payable to the order of the Company; or       (b)       if at any time after the initial effectiveness of the Registration Statement (as defined below), there is not an effective Registration Statement covering the Warrant Shares at the time of exercise, in lieu of any cash payment, the surrender of this Warrant to the Company, with a duly executed Exercise Form specifying the number of Warrant Shares to be purchased, during normal business hours on any Business Day prior to the Expiration Date, in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock computed by using the following formula:       X= Y (A -B)      A       Where X =    the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Warrantholder pursuant to the net exercise.   Y =   the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Warrant being exercised or, if only a portion of such Warrant is being exercised, the portion of such Warrant being canceled (at the time of such calculation).   A =   the Weighted Average Price of one share of Common Stock (at the date of such calculation).   B =    the Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation).          
      The Company agrees that such Warrant Shares shall be deemed to be issued to the Warrantholder as the record holder of such Warrant Shares as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been surrendered and payment made for the Warrant Shares as aforesaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person entitled to receive such shares as the record holder thereof while the transfer books of the Company for the Common Stock are closed for any purpose (but not for any period in excess of five (5) days); but any such surrender of this Warrant for exercise during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for exercise immediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the exercise had been made on the date this Warrant was surrendered and for the number of shares of Common Stock and at the Exercise Price in effect at the date of such surrender. This Warrant and all rights and options hereunder shall expire on the Expiration Date, and shall be wholly null and void and of no value to the extent this Warrant is not exercised before it expires.         The delivery by (or on behalf of) the Warrantholder of the Exercise Form and the applicable Exercise Price as provided above shall constitute the Warrantholder's certification to the Company that it is an  accredited investor,  as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, as of the exercise date.       1.2.    Warrant Shares Certificate . A stock certificate or certificates for the Warrant Shares specified in the Exercise Form shall be delivered to the Warrantholder within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Exercise Form by the Company and payment of the purchase price. If this Warrant shall have been exercised only in part, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the stock certificate or certificates, deliver to the Warrantholder a new Warrant evidencing the rights to purchase the remaining Warrant Shares, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.       1.3     Payment of Taxes.  The issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Warrantholder for any stock transfer or other issuance tax in respect thereto; provided, however, that the Warrantholder shall be required to pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the then Warrantholder as reflected upon the books of the Company.       2.       Restrictions on Transfer: Restrictive Legends .         2.1.    Limitation on Transfer . The Warrantholder shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, give, assign, hypothecate, pledge, encumber, grant a security interest in or otherwise dispose of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) (each a   Transfer  ) this Warrant or any right, title or interest herein or hereto, except in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant. Any attempt to Transfer this Warrant, in whole or in part, or any rights hereunder in violation of the preceding sentence shall be null and void ab initio and the Company shall not register any such Transfer.       2.2.    Transfer Procedures . If the Warrantholder wishes to Transfer this Warrant to a transferee (a   Transferee  ) under this Section 2, the Warrantholder shall give notice to the Company through the use of the assignment form attached hereto as Exhibit B of its intention to make any Transfer permitted under this Section 2 not less than five (5) days prior to effecting such Transfer, which notice shall state the name and address of each Transferee to whom such Transfer is proposed. This Warrant may, in accordance with the terms hereof, be transferred in whole or in part. If this Warrant is transferred in whole, the assignee shall receive a new Warrant (registered in the name of such assignee or its nominee) which new Warrant shall cover the number of shares assigned. If this Warrant is transferred in part, the assignor and assignee shall each receive a new Warrant (which, in the case of the assignee, shall be registered in the name of the assignee or its nominee), each of which new Warrant shall cover the number of shares not so assigned and in respect of which no such exercise has been made in the case of the assignor and the number of shares so assigned, in the case of the assignee.         2.3     Transfers in Compliance with Law: Substitution of Transferee.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Warrant, no Transfer may be made pursuant to this Section 2 unless (a) the Transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions hereto, (b) the Transfer complies in all respects with the applicable provisions of this Warrant, and (c) the Transfer complies in all respects with applicable federal and state securities laws, including, without limitation, the Securities Act. If requested by the Company in its reasonable judgment, the transferring Warrantholder shall supply to the Company (x) an opinion of counsel, at such transferring Warrantholder's expense, to the effect that such Transfer complies with the applicable federal and state securities laws; and (y) a written statement to the Company, in such form as it may reasonably request, certifying that the Transferee is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act.       3.       Legends .         Each Warrant (and each Warrant issued in substitution for any Warrant pursuant hereto) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:       NEITHER THIS WARRANT NOR THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR BLUE SKY LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SAID ACT.       Each stock certificate for Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of any Warrant and each stock certificate issued upon the direct or indirect transfer of any such Warrant Shares shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:       THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, ASSIGNED,TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR BLUE SKY LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SAID ACT.        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrantholder may require the Company to issue a Warrant or a stock certificate for Warrant Shares, in each case without a legend, if either (i) such Warrant or such Warrant Shares, as the case may be, have been registered for resale under the Securities Act or (ii) the Warrantholder has delivered to the Company an opinion of counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Company) which opinion shall be addressed to the Company and be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company's counsel, to the effect that such registration is not required with respect to such Warrant or such Warrant Shares, as the case may be.       4.       Reservation of Shares, Etc.          The Company covenants and agrees as follows:       (a)      All Warrant Shares that are issued upon the exercise of this Warrant will, upon issuance, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, not subject to any preemptive rights, and free from all taxes, liens, security interests, charges, and other encumbrances with respect to the issuance thereof, other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue.       (b)      During the period within which this Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized and reserved, and keep available free from preemptive rights out of its authorized Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon exercise of this Warrant, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant.       5.       Loss or Destruction of Warrant . In case this Warrant shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue and deliver in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant, mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing an equivalent right or interest, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and an indemnity or bond, if requested, also reasonably satisfactory to it.       6.       Ownership of Warrant .         6.1     Ownership of Warrant . The Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Warrant is registered as the holder and owner hereof (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Company) for all purposes and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary, until presentation of this Warrant for registration of transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant represented hereby, if properly assigned in compliance with this Agreement, may be exercised by an assignee for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued.         6.2     Limitations on Exercise . The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant and the Warrantholder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant or to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the holder, together with any affiliate thereof, would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) in excess of 4.99% (the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. Since the Warrantholder will not be obligated to report to the Company the number of shares of Common Stock it may hold at the time of an exercise hereunder, unless the exercise at issue would result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock without regard to any other shares which may be beneficially owned by the Warrantholder or an affiliate thereof, the Warrantholder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section will limit any particular exercise and to the extent that the Warrantholder determines that the limitation contained in this Section applies, the determination of which portion of the principal amount of this Warrant is exercisable shall be the responsibility and obligation of the Warrantholder. If the Warrantholder has delivered an Exercise Notice for a portion of this Warrant that, without regard to any other shares that the Warrantholder or its affiliates may beneficially own, would result in the issuance in excess of the permitted amount hereunder, the Company shall notify the Warrantholder of this fact and shall honor the exercise for the maximum principal amount permitted to be exercised on such exercise date in accordance with Section I and, any principal amount tendered for exercise in excess of the permitted amount hereunder shall remain outstanding under this Warrant. By written notice to the Company, the Warrantholder may (but only as to itself and not to any other holder) from time to time increase the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company. Upon request of the Company, the Warrantholder shall promptly advise the Company as to the number of shares of Common stock then owned by the Warrantholder.       7.       Certain Adjustment .         7.1.    Adjustment for Certain Events.  The number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:       (a)       Stock Dividends: Stock Splits . If at any time after the Issuance Date of this Warrant (i) the Company shall pay a stock dividend or make any other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock shall have been increased by a subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, then, on the date of the payment of such dividend or immediately after the effective date of subdivision or split-up, as the case may be, the number of shares to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant will be increased so that the Warrantholder will be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned immediately following such action had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto, and the Exercise Price will be adjusted as provided in Section 7.1(f).        (b)       Combination of Stock . If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Issuance Date of this Warrant shall have been decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, immediately after the effective date of such combination, the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant will be decreased so that the Warrantholder thereafter will be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned immediately following such action had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto, and the Exercise Price will be adjusted as provided in Section 7.1(f).       (c)       Reorganization, etc . If any capital reorganization of the Company, or any reclassification of the Common Stock, or any consolidation or share exchange of the Company with or merger of the Company with or into any other Person or any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any other Person, shall be effected in such a way that the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or assets (whether such stock, other securities or assets are issued or distributed by the Company or another Person) with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, upon exercise of this Warrant, the Warrantholder shall have the right to receive the kind and amount of stock, other securities or assets receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lease or other transfer by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant had this Warrant been exercised immediately before such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lease or other transfer, subject to adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 7.1.       (d)       Fractional Share.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued to the Warrantholder in connection with the exercise of this Warrant. Instead of any fractional shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable to such Warrantholder, the Company will pay to the Warrantholder a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to that fractional interest of the then current fair market value per share of Common Stock (based on the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock).       (e)       Carryover .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.1, no adjustment shall be made to the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to the Warrantholder (or to the Exercise Price) if such adjustment represents less than one percent (1%) of the number of shares to be so delivered, but any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment that together with any adjustments so carried forward shall amount to one percent (1%) or more of the number of shares to be so delivered. However, upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall make all necessary adjustments not theretofore made to the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to the Warrantholder (or to the Exercise Price) up to and including the date upon which this Warrant is exercised. All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest share, as applicable.          (f)        Exercise Price Adjustment.   Whenever the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant is adjusted as provided pursuant to this Section 7.1, the Exercise Price payable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and of which the denominator shall be the number of Warrant Shares purchasable immediately thereafter; provided, however, that the Exercise Price for each Warrant Share shall in no event be less than the par value of such Warrant Share.       7.2.    No Adjustment for Dividends . Except as provided in Section 7.1, no adjustment in respect of any dividends shall be made during the term of this Warrant or upon the exercise of this Warrant. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no adjustments shall be made on Warrant Shares issuable on the exercise of this Warrant for any cash dividends paid or payable to holders of record of Common Stock prior to the date as of which the Warrantholder shall be deemed to be the record holder of such Warrant Shares.       7.3     Notice of Adjustment . Whenever the number of Warrant Shares or the Exercise Price of such Warrant Shares is adjusted, as herein provided, or the rights of the Warrantholder shall change by reason of other events specified herein, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Warrantholder, notice of such adjustment or adjustments and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the number of Warrant Shares and the Exercise Price of such Warrant Shares after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made.       8.       Amendments.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of the Warrants (including this Warrant) may be amended and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company has obtained the written consent of the Warrantholder.       9.       Notices of Corporate Action.          So long as this Warrant is outstanding and has not been exercised in full, in the event of:       (a)      any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right,       (b)      any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company or any consolidation or merger involving the Company and any other party or any transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Company to any other party, or        (c)      any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company,       the Company will deliver to the Warrantholder a notice specifying (i) the date or expected date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right and the amount and character of any such dividend, distribution or right and (ii) the date or expected date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place and the time, if any such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or other securities) for the securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be delivered at least ten (10) days prior to the date therein specified, in the case of any date referred to in the foregoing subdivisions (i) and (ii).       10.      Registration Rights .         10.1   Registration Right       (a)      The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   Commission  ), following the closing of the Company s next financing, but in any event prior to February 28, 2017, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or other applicable form under the Securities Act (the   Registration Statement  ) covering the resale the Registrable Securities (as defined in Section 11) by the Warrantholder (and certain other subscribers of the Company's securities). Notwithstanding anything in this Warrant to the contrary, the Company may, by written notice to the Warrantholder, delay the filing of a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, if in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, the filing of any registration statement would adversely affect a material proposed or pending acquisition, merger or other material corporate event to which the Company is or expects to be a party.       (b)      For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Company shall not be liable for liquidated damages with respect to any Warrants or Warrant Shares.       10.2   Obligations of the Company. In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities as contemplated by Section 10.1, the Company shall:       (a)      prepare a Registration Statement and file it with the Commission, and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as soon as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event within 180 days after the Issuance Date, which Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;        (b)      use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement until the Registrable Securities can be sold under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or such earlier date when all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold publicly; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to keep the Registration Statement effective for a period of more than three years from the Issuance Date;       (c)      furnish to the Warrantholder such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, and such other documents, as the Warrantholder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by the Warrantholder;       (d)      use reasonable efforts to (i) register and qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions reasonably requested by the Warrantholder, (ii) prepare and file in those jurisdictions all required amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements, (iii) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all times the Registration Statement is in effect, and (iv) take all other actions necessary or advisable to enable the disposition of such securities in all such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 10;       (e)      use its reasonable best efforts to prepare a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement to correct any untrue material statement or omission, and deliver a number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the Warrantholder as he, she or it may reasonably request;       (f)       promptly notify the Warrantholder (or, in the event of an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement at the earliest possible time;       (g)      provide a transfer agent and registrar, which may be a single entity, for the Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of the Registration Statement; and       (h)      cooperate with the Warrantholder to enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the case may be, and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Warrantholder may reasonably request in order for the Holder and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement.         10.3   Obligations of the Warrantholder.       (a)      It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Sections 10.1 and 10.2 with respect to the Warrantholder that the Warrantholder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding the Warrantholder, the Registrable Securities held by the Warrantholder and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents and agreements in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement, the Company shall notify the Warrantholder of the information the Company requires from the Warrantholder (the   Requested Information  ) if the Warrantholder elects to have any of its Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement. If within three (3) Business Days of the filing date the Company has not received the Requested Information from the Warrantholder, then the Company may file the Registration Statement without including Registrable Securities of the Warrantholder.       (b)      The Warrantholder, by its acceptance of the Registrable Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement hereunder.       (c)     In the event of an underwritten offering, the Warrantholder agrees to enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, including, without limitation, customary indemnification and contribution obligations, with the managing underwriter of such offering and to take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities, unless the Warrantholder has decided not to participate.       (d)      The Warrantholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 10.2(e), the Warrantholder will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until its receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 10.2(e). In addition, the Company may restrict disposition of Registrable Securities and the Warrantholder will not be able to dispose of such Registrable Securities, if the Company shall have delivered a certificate to the Warrantholder signed by an officer of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company a delay in the disposition of such Registrable Securities is necessary because the Company has determined that such sales would require public disclosure by the Company of material nonpublic information that is not included in such registration statement.       10.4   Expenses of Registration. In connection with any and all registrations pursuant to Section 10, all expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registration, filings or qualifications, including, without limitation, all registration, listing, filing and qualification fees, printing and accounting fees and costs and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company shall be borne by the Company.        10.5   Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Warrant:       (a)     To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Warrantholder (in such capacity) and its members, managers, directors, officers and/or agents, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for the Warrantholder, and each Person, if any, who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (each, an     Indemnified Party  ), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities joint or several) (collectively,   Claims  ) to which any of them may become subject under of the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (each, a   Violation   (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the Commission), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 10.5(d) with respect to the number of legal counsel, in the event that a conflict arises with Company's attorneys where Warrantholder deems it necessary, in Warrantholder's reasonable discretion, to engage outside, independent counsel, the Company shall promptly reimburse the Warrantholder, and each such other Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.5, as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim, whether or not such Claim, investigation or proceeding is brought or initiated by the Company or a third party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 10.5(a) shall not (i) apply to a Claim arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Warrantholder expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, any prospectus or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any failure of the Warrantholder to deliver a prospectus as required by the Securities Act; or (ii) apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Warrantholder and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Warrantholder as provided herein.        (b)        In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Warrantholder is participating in such capacity, the Warrantholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the same extent and in the same manner set forth in Section 10.5(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any underwriter and any other stockholder selling securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or any of its directors or officers or any Person who controls such stockholder or underwriter (each, also an     Indemnified Party  ), against any Claim to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim arises out of or is based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Warrantholder expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and the Warrantholder shall promptly reimburse an Indemnified Party, as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim, whether or not such Claim, investigation or proceeding is brought or initiated by the Indemnified Party or a third party; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 10.5(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Warrantholder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.       (c)        The Company shall be entitled to receive indemnification from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers, and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution to the same extent as provided above, with respect to information about such Persons so furnished in writing by such Persons expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement.       (d)      Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Section 10.5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 10.5, deliver to an indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly given notice, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;    provided, however  , that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for such party, representation of such party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The Company shall pay for only one legal counsel for the Holder and any Indemnified Party related thereto; such legal counsel shall be selected by the Warrantholder or such other Indemnified Party subject to the Company's approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to another under this Section 10.5, except to the extent that such failure to notify results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantive rights or defenses. The indemnification required by this Section 10.5 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred and is due and payable.         10.6   Contribution.

Our report dated December 7, 2016, contains an explanatory paragraph that states that the Company has limited working capital and limited revenue-generating operations and a history of net losses and net operating cash flow deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

  COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AGREEMENT    Exhibit A      Verification of giant circulating macrophages by microfiltration using whole blood from tumor bearing patients      Rationale : There is extant published data showing that a  giant  circulating macrophage-like cell (DTAM cells) is present in whole blood in all tumor bearing humans tested, while none of these cells are detectable in non-tumor bearing human blood samples. These DTAM cells express macrophage markers, seem to be phagocytic and may be detected through a number of techniques. Detection of this cell and its functions could lead to development of a simple test for tumor bearing individuals, response to therapy etc. Verification of  these observations and further development is needed to develop a commercial test by Collaborator.

      Exhibit A-1      Verification of giant circulating macrophages by microfiltration using whole blood from tumor bearing patients      Rationale : There is extant published data showing that a    giant    circulating macrophage-like cell (DTA M cells) is present in whole blood in all tumor bearing humans tested, while none of these cells are detectable in non-tumor bearing human blood samples. These DTA M cells express macrophage markers, seem to be phagocytic and may be detected through a number of techniques. Detection of this cell and its functions could lead to development of a simple test for tumor bearing individuals, response to therapy etc. Verification of these observations and further development is needed to develop a commercial test by Collaborator.
