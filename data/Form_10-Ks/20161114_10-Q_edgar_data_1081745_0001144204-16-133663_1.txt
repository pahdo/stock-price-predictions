CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated
into this report by reference contain, and we may from time to time make, forward-looking statements. From time to time in the
future, we may make additional forward-looking statements in presentations, at conferences, in press releases, in other reports
and filings and otherwise. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements
that refer to plans, intentions, objectives, goals, targets, strategies, hopes, beliefs, projections, prospects, expectations or
other characterizations of future events or performance, and assumptions underlying the foregoing. The words  may, 
 could,   should,   would,   will,   project,   intend, 
 continue,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   forecast,   expect, 
 plan,   potential,   opportunity,   scheduled,   goal,   target, 
and  future,  variations of such words, and other comparable terminology and similar expressions and references to
future periods are often, but not always, used to identify forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements about the following: 

our prospects, including our future business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, margins, profitability, cash flow, cash position, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, backlog of orders and revenue, our targeted growth rate, and our goals for future revenues and earnings;   

the effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations of current and future economic, business, market and regulatory conditions, including the current economic and market conditions and their effects on our customers and their capital spending and ability to finance purchases of our products, services, and technologies;   

the effects of fluctuations in sales on our business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, margins, profitability, cash flow, capital expenditures, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations;   

our products, services, technologies and systems, including their quality and performance in absolute terms and as compared to competitive alternatives, their benefits to our customers and their ability to meet our customers  requirements, and our ability to successfully develop and market new products, services, and technologies;   

our markets, including our market position and our market share;   

our ability to successfully develop, operate, grow and diversify our operations and businesses;   

our business plans, strategies, goals and objectives, and our ability to successfully achieve them;   

the sufficiency of our capital resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, availability of borrowings under our credit and financing arrangements and other capital resources, to meet our future working capital, capital expenditure, lease and debt service and business growth needs;   

the value of our assets and businesses, including the revenues, profits and cash flow they are capable of delivering in the future;   

industry trends and customer preferences and the demand for our products, services, and technologies;   

the nature and intensity of our competition, and our ability to successfully compete in our markets;   

business acquisitions, combinations, sales, alliances, ventures and other similar business transactions and relationships; and   

the effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations of litigation and other claims and proceedings that arise from time to time.   

Any forward-looking statements we make are based on our current
plans, intentions, objectives, goals, targets, strategies, hopes, beliefs, projections and expectations, as well as assumptions
made by and information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance
or events, but are subject to and qualified by substantial risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are difficult to predict
and are often beyond our control. Forward-looking statements will be affected by assumptions and expectations we might make that
do not materialize or that prove to be incorrect and by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks,
uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which have not materially changed as of the date of this
report, as well as other risks, uncertainties and factors discussed elsewhere in this report, in documents that we include as exhibits
to or incorporate by reference in this report, and in other reports and documents we from time to time file with or furnish to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In light of these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make. 

Any forward-looking statements contained in this report speak
only as of the date of this report, and any other forward-looking statements we make from time to time in the future speak only
as of the date they are made. We undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement or to publicly
disclose any update or revision for any reason, whether as a result of changes in our expectations or the underlying assumptions,
the receipt of new information, the occurrence of future or unanticipated events, circumstances or conditions or otherwise.

1. Business Organization and Nature of Operations  

Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments,
Inc. ( Intellinetics ), is a Nevada corporation incorporated in 1997, with a single operating subsidiary, Intellinetics,
Inc., an Ohio corporation ( Intellinetics Ohio,  together with Intellinetics, the  Company,   we, 
 us  and  our ). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio
became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. 

The Company is an enterprise content management ( ECM )
software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, the Company s
products, services and process models serve, principally, the critical needs of law enforcement and compliance agencies within
the state and local government establishment. 

The Company provides its software solutions principally through
(i) the direct licensing of its software installed on customer computer platforms, and (ii) providing the applications as a service,
accessible through the internet. The Company s comprehensive solutions include services that range from pre-installation
assessment, project scoping, implementation, consulting and ongoing software maintenance and customer support. 

2. Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim
financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8.03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP applicable for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal accruals) considered for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company
as of September 30, 2016 and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, have been included. The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through
the issuance of these financial statements. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016 or any other interim or future period.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2016. 

The Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2015 includes the impact of the restatement on the applicable unaudited financial information for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The restatement relates to the overstatement of revenue on one customer contract during the three months ended June 30,
2015 which was identified by the Company and corrected in the third quarter of 2015 and had no impact on the statement of operations
and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The effect of the restatement on previously issued quarterly
financial information as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is set forth as follows: 

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
(unaudited) 

Previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
quarterly periods ended prior to December 31, 2015 have not been and will not be amended. 

3. Liquidity and Management s Plans  

Through September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred an accumulated
deficit since its inception of $14,562,936. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $159,553. 

From the Company s inception, it has generated revenues
from the sales and implementation of its internally generated software applications. 

The Company s business plan is to increase its sales and
market share by developing an expanded network of resellers through which the Company will sell its expanded software product portfolio.
The Company expects that this marketing initiative will require that it hire and develop an expanded sales force and enhance its
product marketing efforts, all of which will require additional capital. 

The Company expects that through the next 12 months, the capital
requirements to fund the Company s growth, service existing debt obligations, and to cover the operating costs as a public
company will consume substantially all of the cash flows that it intends to generate from its operations. The Company further believes
that during this period, while the Company is focusing on the growth and expansion of its business, the gross profit that it expects
to generate from operations will not generate sufficient funds to cover these anticipated operating costs. Our cash requirements
are insufficient by approximately $103,000 per month. During 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has
used the proceeds from convertible note issuances and the sale of common stock to sustain operations and to follow through on the
execution of its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company has or will be able to obtain sufficient funds to fund the
Company s operations. Given these conditions, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon
increasing its revenues and successfully managing its cash requirements. In addition, the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrants into
established markets, the competitive environment in which the Company operates and its cash requirements. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Since inception, the Company s operations have primarily
been funded through a combination of gross margins, state business development loans, bank loans, convertible loans and loans from
friends and family, and the sale of securities. Although management believes that the Company has access to additional capital
resources, there are currently no commitments or arrangements in effect that would provide for new financing and there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
raised $559,285 through the sale of its common stock and warrants. The proceeds from the sale were used to fund the Company s
working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. 

The current level of cash and operating margins may not be enough
to cover the existing fixed and variable obligations of the Company, so increased revenue performance and the addition of capital
are critical to the Company s success. 

The Company s financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should it be unable to continue as a going concern. 

4. Corporate Actions  

On February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio was acquired by Intellinetics,
when it was known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc., pursuant to a reverse merger, with Intellinetics Ohio surviving as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Intellinetics. 

On September 1, 2014, the Company changed its name from GlobalWise
Investments, Inc., to Intellinetics, Inc. and effected a one-for-seven (1-for-7) reverse stock split of the Company s common
stock. All share and per share amounts herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts. 

Significant estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances
related to receivables, the recoverability of long-term assets, depreciable lives of property and equipment, deferred taxes and
related valuation allowances. The Company s management monitors these risks and assesses its business and financial risks
on a quarterly basis. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk   

The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial
institutions. At times, the Company s cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. 

The number of customers that comprise the Company s customer
base, along with the different industries, governmental entities and geographic regions, in which the Company s customers
operate, limits concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable. The Company does not generally require collateral
or other security to support customer receivables; however, the Company may require its customers to provide retainers, up-front
deposits or irrevocable letters-of-credit when considered necessary to mitigate credit risks. The Company has established an allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon facts surrounding the credit risk of specific customers and past collections history. Credit losses
have been within management s expectations. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company allowance for doubtful
accounts was $17,919 and $23,786, respectively. 

Property and Equipment   

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets on a straight-line basis. Furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and purchased software are depreciated
over three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter,
generally seven to ten years. Upon retirement or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization of these assets are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in the results
of operations. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived
assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 360,  Property, Plant, and Equipment. 
The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment, for recoverability when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are
not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation
that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. 

Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount
of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset
or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or
asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for
this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group. 

Share-Based Compensation   

The Company accounts for stock-based payments to employees in
accordance with ASC 718,  Stock Compensation.  Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock that are recognized
in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant. 

The Company accounts for stock-based payments
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 and ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees,  which requires
that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, with the measurement of such compensation
being subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. 

The grant date fair value of stock option awards is recognized
in earnings as share-based compensation cost over the requisite service period of the award using the straight-line attribution
method. The Company estimates the fair value of the stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The
exercise price of options is specified in the stock option agreements. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility
of the Company s stock for the previous period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted
is based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based upon
a U.S. Treasury instrument with a life that is similar to the expected term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based
upon the yield expected on date of grant to occur over the term of the option. 

On January 1, 2016, the Company granted employees stock options
to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company ( Shares ) at an exercise price of $0.90 per Share in accordance
with the 2015 Intellinetics Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), with vesting continuing until 2019. The total
fair value of $196,250 for these stock options will be recognized by the Company over the applicable vesting period. The total
stock option compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12,226 and $85,820, respectively. 

On February 10, 2016, the Company granted employees stock options
to purchase 210,000 Shares at an exercise price of $0.96 per Share, in accordance with the 2015 Plan, with vesting continuing until
2020. The total fair value of $174,748 for these stock options will be recognized by the Company over the applicable vesting period.
The total stock option compensation for the three (3) and nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,012 and $27,769, respectively. 

On January 2, 2016, the Company issued 69,433 new Shares of
restricted common stock to directors of the Company in accordance with the 2015 Plan. Stock compensation of $62,500 was recorded
on the issuance of the Shares. 

Software Development Costs   

Software development costs for software to be sold or otherwise
marketed incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. The Company defines establishment
of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment
of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the product are capitalized, if material. To
date, all software development costs for software to be sold or otherwise marketed have been expensed as incurred. In accordance
with ASC 350-40,  Internal-Use Software,  the Company capitalizes purchase and implementation costs of internal use
software. No such costs were capitalized during the periods presented. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Stock Compensation  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation
  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which
simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards
and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter
of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting
standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in
its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and
the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Debt Issuance Costs  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU 2015-03. The guidance is effective for
public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the new guidance effective
January 1, 2016. Debt issuance costs that are now presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt
liability amounted to $2,131 and $4,255 on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Revenue Recognition  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of
ASU 2014-09 is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict
the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to
which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, ASU 2014-09 requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with
the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation. Entities will generally be required to make more estimates and use more judgment than under current guidance,
which will be highlighted for users through increased disclosure requirements. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following
standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
( ASU 2016-08 ); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ); and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12 ). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12
with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the  new revenue standards ). In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of
the new revenue standards for one year beyond the originally specified effective date. The update is now effective for public entities
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Earlier application is permitted only
as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Three basic transition methods are available   full retrospective, retrospective with certain practical expedients, and a
cumulative effect approach. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of the new revenue standards will
have on the consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard. 

Revenue Recognition   

a) Sale of Software   

The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC Topic
985-605,  Software Revenue Recognition.  

The Company records revenues from the sale of software licenses
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software product has been installed, there are no significant uncertainties
surrounding product acceptance by the customer, the fees are fixed and determinable, and collection is considered probable. Revenues
included in this classification typically include sales of additional software licenses to existing customers and sales of software
to the Company s Resellers (See section h)   Reseller Agreements, below). 

The Company assesses whether payment terms are customary or
extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring. The Company s sales arrangements
generally include standard payment terms. These terms effectively relate to all customers, products, and arrangements regardless
of customer type, product mix or arrangement size. 

If an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the
license arrangement, revenues related to the undelivered element are deferred based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE )
of the fair value of the undelivered element. Often, multiple-element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses
and the associated post-contract customer support ( PCS ) are sold together. The Company has established VSOE of the
fair value of the undelivered PCS element based on the contracted price for renewal PCS included in the original multiple element
sales arrangement, as substantiated by contractual terms and the Company s significant PCS renewal experience, from the Company s
existing customer base. 

The Company records the revenues for the sales of software with
professional services as prescribed by ASC 985-605, in accordance with the contract accounting guidelines in ASC 605-35,  Revenue
Recognition: Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,  after evaluating for separation of any non-ASC 605-35 elements
in accordance with the provisions of ASC 605-25,  Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Element Arrangements,  as updated.
The Company accounts for these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred
to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract, or on a completed contract basis when dependable estimates are not available. 

The fair value of any undelivered elements in multiple-element
arrangements in connection with the sales of software licenses with professional services are deferred based upon VSOE. 

b) Sale of Software as a Service   

Sale of software as a service ( SaaS ) consists
of revenues from arrangements that provide customers the use of the Company s software applications, as a service, typically
billed on a monthly or annual basis. Advance billings of these services are not recorded to the extent that the term of the arrangement
has not commenced and payment has not been received. Revenue on these services is recognized ratably over the term of the underlying
arrangement. 

c) Sale of Software Maintenance Services   

Software maintenance services revenues
consist of revenues derived from arrangements that provide PCS to the Company s software license holders. These revenues
are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Advance billings of PCS are not recorded to the extent that the term of the
PCS has not commenced and payment has not been received. 

d) Sales of Professional Services   

Professional services consist principally of revenues from consulting,
advisory services, training and customer assistance with management and uploading of data into the Company s applications.
When these services are provided on a time and material basis, the Company records the revenue as the services are rendered, since
the revenues from services rendered through any point in time during the performance period are not contingent upon the completion
of any further services. Where the services are provided under a fixed priced arrangement, the Company records the revenue on a
proportional performance method, since the revenues from services rendered through any point in time during the performance period
are not contingent upon the completion of any further services. 

e) Sale of Third Party Services   

Sale of third party services consist principally of third party
software and/or equipment as a pass through of software and equipment purchased from third parties at the request of customers. 

f) Deferred revenues   

The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to software
maintenance support agreements, when the customer pays for the contract prior to the time the services are performed. Substantially
all maintenance agreements have a one-year term that commences immediately following the delivery of the maintained products or
on the date of the applicable renewal period. 

g) Rights of return and other incentives   

The Company does not generally offer rights of return or any
other incentives such as concessions, product rotation, or price protection and, therefore, does not provide for or make estimates
of rights of return and similar incentives. The Company, from time to time, may discount bundled software sales with PCS services.
Such discounts are recorded as a component of the software sale and any revenue related to PCS is deferred over the PCS period
based upon appropriate VSOE of fair value. 

h) Reseller agreements   

The Company executes certain sales contracts through resellers
and distributors (collectively,  Resellers ). The Company recognizes revenues relating to sales through Resellers when
all the recognition criteria have been met in other words, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred
in the reporting period, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is probable. In addition, the Company assesses the
credit-worthiness of each Reseller, and if the Reseller is undercapitalized or in financial difficulty, any revenues expected to
emanate from such Resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. 

Advertising   

The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $641 and $1,587 and $12 and $1,879,
respectively. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has outstanding stock options
which have not been included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive. As such,
the numerator and the denominator used in computing both basic and diluted net loss per share for each period are the same. 

Income Taxes   

The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income
tax return. The provision for income taxes is computed by applying statutory rates to income before taxes. 

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as of each period-end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount expected to be realized. A 100% valuation allowance has been established on deferred tax assets at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income. 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in its
financial statements as required under ASC 740,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .  The standard prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition accounting. Management determined there were no material uncertain positions
taken by the Company in its tax returns. 

Statement of Cash Flows   

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash includes cash on
hand and demand deposits held by banks. 

6. Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are comprised of the following: 

Total depreciation expense on the Company s property and
equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $2,437 and $8,160, and $2,589 and $8,640
respectively. 

7. Notes Payable  

On July 17, 2009, Intellinetics Ohio, now the sole operating
subsidiary of the Company, issued a note payable to the Ohio State Development Authority in the amount of $1,012,500, bearing interest
at a rate of 6.00% per annum ( Authority Loan No. 1 ). Pursuant to the terms of the Authority Loan No. 1, Intellinetics
Ohio was required to pay only interest through September 30, 2010 and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments of $23,779
each through September 1, 2015. The Authority Loan No. 1 is secured by a senior secured interest on all business assets financed
with loan proceeds, as well as a second secured interest in all business assets. Upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, Intellinetics
Ohio is required to pay a loan participation fee of $101,250, which is accounted for as a loan premium, accreted monthly, utilizing
the interest method, over the term of the Authority Loan No. 1. In June 2014, Intellinetics Ohio and the Ohio State Development
Authority entered into a Notice and Acknowledgement of Modification to Payment Schedule relating to Authority Loan No.1, deferring
a portion of the principal and interest payment until June 1, 2015. On September 25, 2015, Intellinetics Ohio and the Ohio State
Development Authority entered into a Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement related to Authority Loan No. 1, deferring a portion
of the principal payment until October 1, 2016 and extending the maturity date until August 1, 2018. As of September 30, 2016,
the principal amount outstanding under Authority Loan No.1 was $403,373. 

On June 3, 2011, Intellinetics Ohio issued a note payable to
the Ohio State Development Authority in the amount of $750,000, bearing interest at a rate of 1% per annum for the first 12 months,
then interest at a rate of 7% per annum for the second 12 months ( Authority Loan No. 2,  and together with Authority
Loan No. 1, the  Authority Loans ). Intellinetics Ohio was not obligated to remit payments of principal until September
1, 2013. The monthly principal and interest payments, beginning on the third anniversary of the loan origination, are $14,850 and
are payable on a monthly basis through August 1, 2018. The Authority Loan No. 2 is secured by a senior secured interest on all
business assets financed with loan proceeds, as well as a second secured interest in all business assets. Upon maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, Intellinetics Ohio is required to pay a loan participation fee of $75,000, which is accounted for as a loan premium,
accreted monthly utilizing the interest method, over the term of the Authority Loan No. 2. The interest rate of 1% during the first
12 months of this loan was considered to be below market for that period. Intellinetics Ohio further determined that over the life
of the Authority Loan No. 2, the effective interest rate was 5.6% per annum. Accordingly, during the first 12 months of the Authority
Loan No. 2, Intellinetics Ohio recorded interest expense at the 5.6% rate per annum. The difference between the interest expense
accrual at 5.6% and the stated rate of 1% over the first 12 months is credited to deferred interest. The deferred interest amount
that is accumulated over the first 12 months of the loan term will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining
term of the Authority Loan No. 2. On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, deferred interest of $159,304 and $136,078, respectively,
was reflected within long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In June 2014, Intellinetics Ohio and
the Ohio State Development Authority entered into a Notice and Acknowledgement of Modification to Payment Schedule, deferring a
portion of the principal and interest payment until June 1, 2015. On September 25, 2015 Intellinetics Ohio and the Ohio State Development
Authority entered into a Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement related to Authority Loan No. 2, deferring a portion of the interest
payment until October 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under Authority Loan No. 2 was $469,661. 

The Authority Loans were granted to Intellinetics Ohio in connection
with the State of Ohio s economic development programs. The proceeds from these loans were used by Intellinetics Ohio to
support its efforts in developing software solutions for its customers. 

The Authority Loans are subject to certain covenants and reporting
requirements. Intellinetics Ohio is required to, within three years of the respective loan origination dates of each of the Authority
Loans, have created and/or retained an aggregate of 25 full time jobs in the State of Ohio. If Intellinetics has not attained these
employment levels by the respective dates, then the interest rates on the Authority Loans shall increase to 10% per annum. In July
2014, Intellinetics Ohio informed the State of Ohio that it would not meet the required employment level. As a result of this non-compliance
with a covenant of Authority Loan No. 1, the Ohio State Development Authority exercised its right to increase the interest rate
from 6.0% to 7.0%, effective October 1, 2014. The approximate impact of this increase is to raise Intellinetics Ohio s balloon
payment by $6,000 on Authority Loan No. 1, which is due, as amended on August 1, 2018. Intellinetics Ohio has had past instances
of non-compliance with certain of the loan covenants. Intellinetics Ohio is currently in compliance with all the other loan covenants.
There can be no assurance that Intellinetics Ohio will not become non-compliant with one or more of these covenants in the future. 

Between June 24, 2014 and July 7, 2014, the Company issued convertible
promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $135,000 (the  Convertible Notes ) to two accredited investors (the  Note
Investors ). The Convertible Notes matured on December 31, 2015 (the  Maturity Date ) and bore interest at an
annual rate of interest of 10% until maturity, with interest payable quarterly. The Note Investors had a right, in their sole discretion,
to convert the Convertible Notes into Shares under certain circumstances at a conversion rate of $0.56 per Share. Because the Convertible
Notes had not been fully repaid by the Company or converted into Shares at the election of the Note Investors prior to the Maturity
Date, the Convertible Notes began accruing interest at the annual rate of 12% commencing on the Maturity Date. The Company used
the proceeds of the Convertible Notes for working capital, general corporate purposes, and debt repayment. On January 6, 2016,
the Note Investors converted $135,000 of the Convertible Notes and accrued interest thereon of $35,038 into 303,912 Shares and
141,698 warrants to purchase Shares, as part of a private placement and note exchange commenced in December 2015. The warrants
have an exercise price equal to $0.65 per Share and contain a cashless exercise provision. All warrants are immediately exercisable
and are exercisable for five years from issuance. Interest expense of $113,762 was recorded on the issuance of these warrants. 

The table below reflects all notes payable at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with the exception of related party notes disclosed in Note 8 - Notes Payable - Related
Parties.

reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, deferred interest of $159,304 and $136,078, respectively, was reflected within long term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets. 

With respect to all notes outstanding (other than the notes
to related parties), interest expense, including the amortization of deferred financing costs, accrued loan participation fees,
original issue discounts, deferred interest and related fees, interest expense related to warrants issued for the conversion of
convertible notes, and the embedded conversion feature was $18,528 and $173,576 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively, and $34,804 and $82,907, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out
of legally available funds. However, the current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain earnings, if any, for the operation
and expansion of the business. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled
to share ratably in all assets of the Company that are legally available for distribution. 

Sales of Unregistered Securities and Conversion of Convertible
Promissory Notes   

On December 11, 2015, the Company commenced a private offering
of securities (the  Equity Offering ) with certain accredited investors for up to 1,666,666 units for a price of $1.20
per unit (the  Units ). Each Unit consisted of two Shares and a warrant to purchase one Share. The warrants are exercisable
to purchase one Share at an exercise price of $0.65 per Share, contain a cashless exercise provision, and are exercisable for five
years after issuance. This Equity Offering was open for a period terminating on December 31, 2015 with an option to extend until
January 31, 2016 at the election of the Company. Simultaneously with this Equity Offering, the Company also offered to existing
noteholders the ability to convert into common stock any outstanding convertible notes issued by the Company, plus accrued interest,
at each note s conversion price (the  Note Conversion Offering ). In addition, upon such conversion, noteholders
received warrants containing the same exercise terms and price as investors in the Equity Offering. 

On January 6, 2016, noteholders converted $135,000 of convertible
promissory notes with accrued interest of $35,038 into 303,912 Shares and also received 141,698 warrants, as part of the Note Conversion
Offering. 

On January 25, 2016, the Company entered into security purchase
agreements with accredited investors for 506,599 Units, which consisted of 1,013,198 Shares with 506,599 warrants for aggregate
cash proceeds of $607,919, as part of the Equity Offering. 

The Company retained Taglich Brothers, Inc. (the  Placement
Agent ) as the exclusive placement agent for the Equity Offering and the Note Conversion Offering. In compensation, the Company
paid the Placement Agent a cash payment of 8% of the gross proceeds of the Equity Offering and of the face value of the current
outstanding convertible promissory notes that were converted in the Note Conversion Offering, along with warrants to purchase Shares,
and the reimbursement for the Placement Agent s reasonable out of pocket expenses, FINRA filing fees and related legal fees. 

On January 27, 2016, the Company paid the Placement Agent cash
in the amount of of $62,237 and issued the Placement Agent 131,682 warrants to purchase Shares at an exercise price at $0.715 per
Share, under the terms of the Placement Agent agreement for the Equity Offering and the Note Conversion Offering. Of the warrants
issued to the Placement Agent, 30,363 warrants were issued in conjunction with the Note Conversion Offering, and underwriting expense
of $24,207 was recorded for the issuance of these warrants. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company charged $0 and $113,762, respectively, in interest expense for the warrants issued to the noteholders and $24,207 in underwriting
expenses in regards to the warrants issued to the Placement Agent for the convertible promissory notes, utilizing the Black-Scholes
valuation model to value the warrants issued. The weighted-average grant date fair value of warrants issued was determined to be
$0.80. 

The estimated values of warrants, as well as the assumptions
that were used in calculating such values were based on estimates at the issuance date as follows: 

Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Offering and the Note Conversion
Offering, the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the re-sale of the Shares sold in the
Equity Offering and the Note Conversion Offering and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent warrants. The registration
statement was declared effective on May 5, 2016. 

Issuance of Restricted Common Stock to Directors   

On January 2, 2016, the Company issued 69,433 Shares of restricted
common stock to directors of the Company in accordance with the 2015 Plan, and as part of an annual compensation plan for both
employee and non-employee directors. The grant of Shares was not subject to vesting. Stock compensation of $62,500 was recorded
on the issuance of the common stock. 

Exercise of Warrants   

On February 15, 2013, the Company and A. Michael Chretien, a
member of the Board of Directors, entered into a return to treasury agreement, whereby A. Michael Chretien returned 500,000 Shares
to the Company. As consideration for A. Michael Chretien returning to the Company treasury these 500,000 Shares, the Company issued
one four-year warrant to A. Michael Chretien with a right to purchase 500,000 Shares at $0.007 per Share within four years of the
shareholders of the Company increasing the number of authorized Shares, with piggyback registration rights. The warrant has a right
of first refusal for A. Michael Chretien to exercise up to 500,000 Shares prior to the Company issuing Shares in any transaction.
The Company issued the warrant in reliance on an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and
Rule 506 of Regulation D, as promulgated by the SEC. On February 15, 2016, A. Michael Chretien exercised the warrant and purchased
500,000 Shares at $0.007 per Share.

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates
and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition accrued expenses, financing operations, contingencies and litigation.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate
carry value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. These accounting policies are
described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements included in this report
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Company Overview   

The Company is an enterprise content management ( ECM )
software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, the Company s
products, services and process models serve, principally, the critical needs of law enforcement and compliance agencies within
the state and local government establishment. The Company provides its software solutions principally through (i) the direct licensing
of its software installed on customer computer platforms and (ii) providing the applications as a service, accessible through the
internet. The Company s comprehensive solutions include services that range from pre-installation assessment, project scoping,
implementation, consulting and ongoing software maintenance and customer support. In time, the Company anticipates that the provision
of  cloud  application services, or software as a service, will become a more significant part of its software sales
business. 

The Company s software products allow customers to manage
 enterprise content  (unstructured data such as hard-copy scanned documents, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, JPEG
files, images, pictures, faxes, audio/video files, emails, and PowerPoint presentations) through its entire life cycle. The Company s
platform, Intellivue , specializes in improving and enhancing business operations for clients by making document and content
management simple, accessible and affordable. The Company offers industry-specific vertical  composite content applications 
( CCA ) to clients in a pre-configured, on-demand basis through the  On-demand Solution Store . 
This approach to deploying templates for specific business processes empowers clients to affordably manage their complete document
life cycle inherently within the turnkey IntellivueTM platform. 

To date, most of our software customers install our software
onto computers at their location (premises-based). In time, the Company anticipates that the provision of  cloud  application
services, or software as a service, will become a more significant part of its software sales business. We anticipate that cloud-based
services will become the principal part of our software sales business and a primary source of revenues for us, because this model
allows customers to avoid significant upfront costs for hardware and installation services required for a premises-based delivery.
That said, we are just beginning to see our customers migrate to such cloud-based services. Our revenues from cloud-based delivery
of our software, as a percentage of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were 19% and 10% respectively. 

Our current sales strategy is to focus our sales efforts toward
a much greater percentage of sales through intermediaries, such as software resellers and multi- function device resellers, rather
than through direct sales. We have developed marketing programs with resellers that facilitate their selling and support of our
software solutions. We refer to these resellers as our  channel partners.  We believe that our channel partner strategy
improvements have increased the competitive strength of our platform of products. In addition, we have established a set of business
solutions templates that provide base software configurations which we believe will facilitate our delivery and installation of
software to our customers. We believe that these advancements, in the aggregate, will allow us to license and sell our products
to a broader customer base, shortening our sales cycle, making margins more consistent, and allowing us to expand our sales through
new channel partnerships. We continue to devote significant efforts, in both development and marketing, in bringing about this
change in core strategic focus for the Company. 

Revenues   

Revenues are generated from the licensing, subscription and
maintenance of our enterprise software products and from professional services fees in connection with the implementation and integration
of software applications. Our revenues, especially our license revenues, are impacted by the competitive strength of our software
products, as well as general economic and industry conditions. 

For our sales of software our customer base has traditionally
been made up of customers with larger projects that can take as much as nine (9) months to two (2) years to complete. For these
projects, our policy is to recognize revenue on the percentage of completion basis, measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred
to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract, or on a completed contract basis when dependable estimates are not available. 

Cost of Revenues   

We maintain a staff of software design engineers, developers,
installers and customer support personnel, dedicated to the development and implementation of customer applications, customer support
and maintenance of deployed software applications. While the total costs related to these personnel are relatively consistent from
period to period, the cost of revenues categories to which these costs are charged may vary depending on the type of work performed
by our staff. 

Costs of revenues also include the costs of server hosting and
SaaS application, as well as certain third-party costs and hardware costs incurred. Third-party and hardware costs may vary widely
from quarter to quarter. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses   

Sales expenses consist of compensation and overhead associated
with the development and support of our channel sales network, as well as our direct sales efforts. Marketing expenses consist
primarily of compensation and overhead associated with the development and production of product marketing materials, as well as
promotion of the Company s products through the trade and industry. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses consist of the compensation
and overhead of administrative personnel and professional services firms performing administrative functions, including management,
accounting, finance and legal services, plus expenses associated with infrastructure, including depreciation, information technology,
telecommunications, facilities and insurance. 

Interest, Net   

Interest, net, consists primarily of interest expense associated
with our notes payable. See Results of Operations   Interest Expense   Net, for additional information. 

How We Evaluate our Business Performance and Opportunities  

Major Quantitative and Qualitative Factors We
Consider in the Evaluation of our Business   

The major qualitative and quantitative factors we consider in
the evaluation of our operating results include the following: 

Our current strategy is to focus upon cloud-based delivery of our software products through channel partners. Historically, our revenues have mostly resulted from premise-based software licensing revenue and professional services revenue. Our observation of industry trends leads us to anticipate that cloud-based delivery will become our principal software business and a primary source of revenues for us, but we are just beginning to see our customers migrate to cloud-based services. Accordingly, when we evaluate our results, we assess whether our cloud-based software revenues are increasing, relative to prior periods and relative to other sources of revenue. Additionally, we assess whether our sales resulting from relationships with channel partners are increasing, relative to prior periods and relative to direct sales to customers. Finally, we consider the number of channel partners with which we have a contract or other relationship to be an indicator of our performance and future results.   

Our customer engagements often involve the development and licensing of customer-specific software solutions and related consulting and software maintenance services. When analyzing whether to undertake a particular customer engagement, we often consider all of the following factors as part of our overall strategy to grow the business: (i) the profit margins the project may yield, (ii) whether the project will allow us to enter a new geographic market, (iii) whether the project would enable us to demonstrate our capabilities to large national resellers, or (iv) whether the project would help to develop new product and service features that we could integrate into our suite of products, resulting in an overall product portfolio that better aligns with the needs of our target customers. As a result of this pipeline analysis, we may take on projects with a lower project margin if we determine that the project is valuable to our business for the other reasons discussed.   

Our sales cycle is long, sometimes lasting 18-24 months. Even when a project begins, we often perform pre-installation assessment, project scoping, and implementation consulting. Our revenue and profit in any particular period is significantly influenced by sales efforts and preliminary project work conducted in prior periods but not completed and recognized until the current period. Therefore, when we plan our business and evaluate our results, we consider the revenue we expect to recognize from projects in our late-stage pipeline.   

Our research and development efforts and expenses to create new software products are critical to our success. When developing new products or product enhancements, our developers collaborate with our own employees across a wide variety of job functions. We also gather in-depth feedback from our customers and channel partners. We evaluate new products and services to determine their likelihood of market success and their potential profitability.   

We monitor our costs and capital needs to ensure efficiency as well as an adequate level of support for our business plan.   

Uncertainties, Trends, and Risks that can cause
Fluctuations in our Operating Results   

Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past
and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors. Factors that affect our operating results
include the following: 

our capital needs, and the costs at which we are able to obtain capital;   

general economic conditions that affect the amount our customers are spending on their software needs, the cost at which we can provide software products and services, and the costs at which we can obtain capital;   

the development of new products, requiring development expenses, product rollout, and market acceptance;   

the length of our sales cycle;   

the fact that many of our customers are governmental organizations, exposing us to the risk of early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions, and other penalties not typically associated with private customers;   

our relationships with our channel partners, for purposes of product delivery, introduction to new markets and customers, and for feedback on product development;   

our need to increase expenses at the beginning of a customer project, while associated revenue is recognized over the life of the project;   

the potential effect of security breaches, data center infrastructure capacity, our use of open-source software, and governmental regulation and litigation over data privacy and security;   

whether our clients renew their agreements and timely remit our accounts receivable;   

whether we can license third-party software on reasonable terms;   

our ability to protect and utilize our intellectual property; and   

the effects of litigation, warranty claims, and other claims and proceedings.   

Due to all these factors and the other risks discussed in Part
I, Item IA of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our results of operations should not be relied
upon as an indication of our future performance. Comparisons of our operating results with prior periods is not necessarily meaningful
or indicative of future performance. 

Results of Operations  

Overview   

We reported net losses of $246,767 and $253,553 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease in net loss of $6,786 or 3%. We reported gross
profit of $537,532 and $491,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase

30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase in operating expenses of $177,460, or 30%. The increase in operating
expenses was principally related to stock option compensation, director fees and professional fees associated
with adding additional personnel for the future growth of the Company. We reported net losses of $1,184,497 and $1,130,173
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase in net loss of $54,324 or 5%. We
reported gross profit of $1,449,134 and $1,401,243 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
an increase of $47,891, or 3%. We reported operating expenses of $2,448,766 and $2,179,726 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $269,040, or 12%. The increase in operating expenses was principally
related to stock option compensation, director fees, marketing and professional fees associated with adding additional personnel
for the future growth of the Company. 

Revenues   

We reported total revenues of $679,445 and $621,974 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $57,471 or 9%. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, revenues were $1,919,585 and $1,767,919, respectively, representing an increase of $151,666
or 9%. 

Sale of Software  

Revenues from the sale of software principally consist of sales
of additional or upgraded software licenses and applications to existing customers and sales of software to our resellers. These
software revenues were $96,869 and $136,459, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
a decrease of $39,590, or 29%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, revenues were $289,437 and
$449,219 representing a decrease of $159,782, or 36%. The decreases were due to concentrating our efforts to develop and expand
our software as a service as discussed below. 

Sale of Software as a Service  

For those customers that wish to avoid the upfront costs of
typical premises-based software installations, we provide access to our software as a service, accessible through the internet.
Our customers typically enter into our software as a service agreement for periods in excess of one year. Under these agreements,
we generally provide access to the applicable software, data storage and related customer assistance and support. Our software
as a service revenues were $137,343 and $64,817 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
an increase of $72,526, or 112%. Our software as a service revenues were $363,842 and $182,322, for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $181,520 or 100%. The increase in revenue year-over-year was primarily
the result of new customers and relationships with channel partners. 

Sale of Software Maintenance Services  

Software maintenance services revenues consist of fees for post
contract customer support services provided to license holders. These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support,
enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available. A substantial portion of these revenues
were generated from customers to whom we sold software in prior years who have continued to renew their maintenance agreements.
The support and maintenance agreements typically have a term of 12 months. Our software maintenance support revenue was $256,441
and $239,506, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $16,935, or 7%.
Our software maintenance support revenue was $748,354 and $700,116 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing an increase of $48,238, or 7%. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of the sale of new customer software
and the continued maintenance of previous customers, for which maintenance agreements are renewed each year. 

Sale of Professional Services  

Professional services revenues consist of
revenues from consulting, discovery, training, and advisory services to assist customers with document management needs. These
revenues include those arrangements where we do not sell software license as an element of the overall arrangement. Professional
services revenues were $153,895 and $152,169 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
an increase of $1,726, or 1%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, professional services revenues
were $337,680 and $327,189, respectively, representing an increase of $10,491 or 3%. The increase primarily resulted from an increase
in requests from our clients in the second quarter of 2016. 

Sale of Third Party Services  

Third party services consist of third party vendor software,
hardware and/or services purchases as requested by our customers in conjunction with Intellinetics core software or services. Third
party services revenues were $34,897 and $29,023, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing an increase of $5,874 or 20%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, third party services
were $180,272 and $109,073, an increase of $71,199, or 65%. The increase was primarily from document scanning projects during the
first and second quarters of 2016. 

Cost of Revenues   

The cost of revenues during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $141,913 and $130,694, respectively, representing an increase of $11,219, or 9%. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the cost of revenues was $470,451 and $366,676, representing an increase of $103,775,
or 28%. The increase in cost of revenue for the period ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to additional labor costs in completing
software services, and the cost of third party services. 

Gross Margins   

Overall gross margin for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were 79% and 79%, respectively, representing no change. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
gross margins were 75% and 79%. The decrease in gross margin year-over-year is primarily as result of the mix in revenues, primarily
professional and third party services. 

Operating Expenses   

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses were $420,935 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $390,841 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an
increase of $30,094, or 8%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense in the 3 rd  quarter of 2016.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $1,598,185 and $1,548,096, representing
an increase of $50,089 or 3%. The increase was primarily due to warrant expense relating to the conversion of notes payable to
equity, employee stock option expense and directors  fees and stock expense issued in 2016, offset from a reduction in stock
option compensation expense in 2015. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses  

Sales and marketing expenses increased to $338,843 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $191,325 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an
increase of $147,518 or 77%. The increase was primarily related to our hiring additional sales personnel for business development
for additional channel partners and with market branding of our products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, sales and marketing expenses were $842,421 and $622,990, representing an increase of $219,431 or 35%. The increase
was due to the increase in sales personnel and market branding in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization was $2,437 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,589 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $152
or approximately 6%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, depreciation and amortization was $8,160
and $8,640, representing a decrease of $480. The decrease was the result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated. 

Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net, was $22,084 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $160,078 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing
a decrease of $137,994 or 86%. The decrease resulted from a decrease in the average debt balance outstanding as a result from the
conversion of the convertible promissory notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, interest expense
was $184,865 and $351,690, a decrease of $166,825 or 47%. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average debt balance
outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 offset by interest expense charged for warrants on the conversion of
the convertible promissory notes in the first quarter of 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have financed our operations primarily through a combination
of cash on hand; cash generated from operations, and proceeds from private sales of equity. As of September 30, 2016, our major
liquidity indicators are: 

From our inception, we have generated revenues
from the sales and implementation of our internally generated software applications. Our plan is to increase our sales and market
share by developing an expanded network of resellers through which we expect to sell our expanded software product portfolio. We
expect that this marketing initiative will require us to develop an expanded sales force and enhance our product marketing efforts,
all of which will require additional capital. Although management believes that we may have access to additional capital resources,
there are currently no commitments in place for new financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on
commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

On January 25, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase
agreement with certain accredited investors for a private placement of common stock with attached warrants for gross proceeds of
$607,919, which was part of a private placement commenced in December 2015. The proceeds from the private placement were used to
fund our working capital needs and debt repayment. 

The Company expects that through the next 12 months the capital
requirements to fund the Company s growth and to cover the operating costs as a public company will consume substantially
all the cash flows that it intends to generate from its operations. The Company further believes that during this period, while
the Company is focusing on the growth and expansion of its business, the gross profit that it expects to generate from operations
may not generate sufficient funds to cover these anticipated operating costs. Our cash requirements are insufficient by approximately
$103,000 per month. Assuming over the next 9 to 12 months, we do not increase our cash flow generated from operations or obtain
additional capital or debt financing, we will not have sufficient liquidity to fund operations. 

There is no assurance that the Company s plans as discussed
above will materialize and/or that the Company will have sufficient funds to fund the Company s operations. Given these conditions,
the Company ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon increasing its revenues, successfully managing its cash requirements,
and raising additional funds. 

Assuming that we are successful in our growth plans and development
efforts, we believe that we will be able to raise additional funds through sales of our common stock, issuance of debt or some
other financing source. However, we currently have no agreements, commitments, or other arrangements in place that would provide
any additional funds, and thus there is no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional funds or that any such funds
we do raise would be sufficient to fund our operations or would be on acceptable terms. 

Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Shares Issued and Outstanding and Shares Reserved
for Exercise of Warrants  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has 16,815,850 Shares
issued and outstanding, 5,444,924 Shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 1,930,557 Shares reserved
for issuance under the 2015 Intellinetics Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. 

Our Shares are available for quotation on the OTCQB Venture
Market, and we believe this is important for raising capital to finance our growth plan. We intend to deploy any future capital
we may raise to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, develop ancillary software products, enhance our internal infrastructure,
support the accounting, auditing and legal costs of operating as a public company, and provide working capital. We currently have
no commitment to raise any additional capital in the future and there is no assurance we will be able to do so.

Summary of Current Outstanding Indebtedness  

The Company s outstanding indebtedness
at September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

There were no material commitments for capital

Cash Flows   

Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,249,649 and $411,111 respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net
cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss adjusted for non- cash expenses of $325,101 and a
decrease in net operating liabilities of $390,253. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net cash used in operating
activities was primarily attributable to the net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses of $590,073 and an increase in net operating
liabilities of $128,989. 

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $6,867 and $3,888, respectively, and was related to the purchase of property and equipment. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $298,951. The net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the sale of common stock,
offset by $263,834 of notes payable repayments, of which $83,834 was repaid to related parties. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $402,939. The net cash provided by financing activities resulted from new related party borrowings
of $582,000, offset by $179,061 of notes payable repayments, of which $23,248 was repaid to related parties. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

There have been no significant changes during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and use of estimates in our  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ending in December 31, 2015. 

Liquidity, Going Concern and Management s
Plans   

We have incurred substantial recurring losses since our inception.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We are also in the
process of exploring strategies to increase our existing revenues. We believe we will be successful in these efforts; however,
there can be no assurance we will be successful in raising additional debt or equity financing or finding any other financing source
to fund our operations on terms agreeable to us. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to exercise its judgment. We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing
sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities,
our recognition of revenues and expenses, and other financial information. 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments.
Areas in which we exercise significant judgment include, but are not necessarily limited to, our valuation of accounts receivable
and income taxes. 

We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors,
including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, and the
attributes of our products and services. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments
and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. 

While we believe that the factors we evaluate
provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results
will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ
from such estimates. 

A description of significant accounting policies that require
us to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the allowance for
doubtful accounts and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. 

We establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on certain
percentages of accounts sixty days or more past due and when available information causes us to believe that credit loss is probable.
Due to historical losses, a full valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures.  

With the participation of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that we are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as a result of
the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 

The following material weakness, which relates to internal control
over financial reporting, was identified in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
has not been remediated: 

We did not maintain technical accounting knowledge,
and training in the application of GAAP commensurate with our complexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements.  In
connection with the audit of the December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements a number of required adjustments were identified
by our independent registered public accounting firm related to our offering of stock and warrants and the conversion of convertible
debt.  As a result, there is a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements,
including disclosures, will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We are evaluating the continuing material weakness, as well
as the need and costs to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function.  As
our operations are relatively small, we do not anticipate being able to hire additional internal personnel until such time as our
operations are large enough to justify the hiring of additional accounting personnel. As necessary, we may engage consultants in
the future in order to ensure proper accounting for our consolidated financial statements. 

(b) Changes in internal control over
financial reporting.  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

None. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  

Our business and operating results are subject to many risks,
uncertainties and other factors. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, affairs, assets, financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. These risks, uncertainties and other factors
include the information discussed elsewhere in this report as well as the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which have not materially changed as of the date of this report.

the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have not previously been included on a Form 8-K.
