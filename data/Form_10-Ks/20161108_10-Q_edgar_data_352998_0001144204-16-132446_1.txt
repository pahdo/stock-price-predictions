  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03   of
Regulation S-X .  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by other reports we
may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from those audited consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016.  

1.       Organization
and Business   

Teligent, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
(collectively the  Company ), is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company. Our mission is to become a leader in the
specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded and generic
injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada.  In the United States, we currently market twelve generic
topical pharmaceutical products and four branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products.  Through the completion of an
acquisition, we now sell a total of twenty generic and branded generic injectable products and medical devices in Canada. 
Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts.  We also provide development, formulation,
and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter ( OTC ), and cosmetic markets.  We operate
our business under one segment. Effective October 23, 2015, we changed our name from IGI Laboratories, Inc. to Teligent, Inc. 
On October 26, 2015, our common stock, which was previously listed on the NYSE MKT, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
under the trading symbol  TLGT.   Our office, laboratories and manufacturing facilities are located at 105 Lincoln
Avenue, Buena, New Jersey. 

2.        Liquidity   

The Company s principal
sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents of approximately $74.6 million at September 30, 2016 and cash from operations.
The Company terminated its $10 million credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation, as agent, and GE Capital Bank
and certain other institutions, as lenders, in February 2016. 

On December 10, 2014, the Company
entered into a purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell its 3.75%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $139 million, after
expenses of approximately $4.8 million, upon completion of the transaction. The sale was completed on December 16, 2014. See Note
6. 

The Company may require additional
funding and this funding will depend, in part, on the timing and structure of potential business arrangements. If necessary, the
Company may continue to seek to raise additional capital through the sale of its equity or through a strategic alliance with a
third party. There may also be additional acquisition and growth opportunities that may require external financing. There can be
no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The Company also has the ability
to defer certain product development and other programs, if necessary. The Company believes that its existing capital resources
will be sufficient to support its current business plan and operations beyond  2017. 

3.       Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   

Use of Estimates    

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Significant estimates include valuation of the derivative liability, sales returns and allowances ( SRA ),
allowances for excess and obsolete inventories, allowances for doubtful accounts, provisions for income taxes and related deferred
tax asset valuation allowances, stock based compensation, the impairment of long-lived assets (including intangibles and goodwill)
and accruals for environmental cleanup and remediation costs. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Stock Based Compensation    

ASC 718-10 defines the fair-value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans and transactions used by the Company to account for its issuances
of equity instruments to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value as well as to acquire
goods or services from non-employees. Transactions in which the Company issues stock-based compensation to employees, directors
and advisors and for goods or services received from non-employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued. The Company utilizes pricing models in determining the fair values of options and warrants issued as stock-based compensation.
These pricing models utilize the market price of the Company s common stock and the exercise price of the option or warrant,
as well as time value and volatility factors underlying the positions. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the
vesting period of the grant. 

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments    

The carrying amounts of cash
and cash equivalents, trade receivables, restricted cash, notes payable, accounts payable, capital leases and other accrued liabilities
at September 30, 2016 approximate their fair value for all periods presented. The Company measures fair value in accordance with
ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . ASC 820-10 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing
the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted
prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing
for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. The fair value
hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. 

The Company measures its derivative
liability at fair value. The derivative embedded convertible option related to the Notes issued December 16, 2014 was valued using
the  with  and  without  analysis. A  with  and  without  analysis is a standard
valuation technique for valuing embedded derivatives by first considering the value of the Notes with the option and then considering
the value of the Notes without the option. The difference is the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The embedded derivative
is classified within Level 3 because it is valued using the  with  and  without  method, which does utilize
inputs that are unobservable in the market. 

On May 20, 2015, the Company received approval to
increase its authorized shares sufficient to allow for the conversion of the entire note into equity at its annual shareholders
meeting. Therefore, the derivative liability of $18.3 million was reclassified into stockholders equity. The Company recorded a
change in the fair value of the derivative liability through May 20, 2015 of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
On May 20, 2015, the Company reclassified the fair value of the derivative liability into stockholders equity due to the approval
of sufficient shares. Based on the closing price of the Company s common stock as of September 30, 2016, the net carrying
value of the Notes was approximately $112.6 million compared to their face value of $143.75 million as of September 30, 2016. However,
this variance is due to the conversion feature in the Notes rather than to changes in market interest rates. The Notes carry a
fixed interest rate and therefore do not subject the Company to interest rate risk. 

Earnings (Loss) Per
Share    

Basic earnings (loss) per share
of common stock is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common stock equivalents include shares issuable
upon the conversion of the Notes and the exercise of options and warrants. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the potential dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share, as
their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

(in thousands except shares and per share
data)  

Revenue Recognition    

 The Company considers revenue
realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or contractual services
rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured in conformity with ASC 605,   Revenue
Recognition  . 

The Company derives its revenues
from three basic types of transactions: sales of its own pharmaceutical products, sales of manufactured product for its customers
included in product sales, and research and product development services and other services performed for third parties. 
Due to differences in the substance of these transaction types, the transactions require, and the Company utilizes, different revenue
recognition policies for each. 

Product Sales, net, include Company Product Sales
and Contract Manufacturing Sales, as follows: 

Product Sales, Net  

  (in thousands)  

Company Product Sales   : 
The Company records revenue from Company product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer,
which is typically upon delivery of products to the customer. 

As is customary in the pharmaceutical
industry, the Company s gross product sales from Company label products are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving
at reported net product sales. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products, an estimate of SRA is recorded, which
reduces product sales. Accounts receivable and/or accrued expenses are also reduced and/or increased by the SRA amount. These adjustments
include estimates for chargebacks, rebates, cash discounts and returns and other allowances. These provisions are estimates based
on historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract
sales terms with direct and indirect customers. The estimation process used to determine our SRA provision has been applied on
a consistent basis and no material adjustments have been necessary to increase or decrease our reserves for SRA as a result of
a significant change in underlying estimates. The Company will use a variety of methods to assess the adequacy of our SRA reserves
to ensure that our financial statements are fairly stated. These will include periodic reviews of customer inventory data, customer
contract programs, subsequent actual payment experience, and product pricing trends to analyze and validate the SRA reserves. 

The provision for chargebacks
is our most significant sales allowance. A chargeback represents an amount payable in the future to a wholesaler for the difference
between the invoice price paid to the Company by our wholesale customer for a particular product and the negotiated contract price
that the wholesaler s customer pays for that product. The Company s chargeback provision and related reserve varies
with changes in product mix, changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventories. The provision for chargebacks
also takes into account an estimate of the expected wholesaler sell-through levels to indirect customers at contract prices. The
Company will validate the chargeback accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest wholesale
customers. This customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future chargeback claims based on
historical chargeback and contract rates. These large wholesalers represent 90% - 95% of the Company s chargeback payments.
The Company continually monitors current pricing trends and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks
is fairly stated. 

Net revenues and accounts receivable balances in the
Company s consolidated financial statements are presented net of SRA estimates. Certain SRA balances are included in accounts
payable and accrued expenses. 

Gross-To-Net Sales Deductions  

  (in thousands)  

Net Company product sales
of $13.9 million and $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included in
product sales, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Company product sales of $34.2 million and
$23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included in product sales, net in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accounts receivable are presented net of SRA balances of $26.0 million and
$11.1 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts payable and accrued expenses include $2.9 million and
$1.3 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for certain fees related to services provided by the wholesalers.
Wholesale fees of $1.5 million and $1.4 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were included in cost of goods sold. Wholesale fees of $2.8 million and $4.7 million for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were included in cost of goods sold. In addition, in connection with four of the
sixteen products the Company currently manufactures, markets and distributes in its own label in the U.S., in accordance with
an agreement entered into in December 2011, the Company is required to pay a royalty calculated based on net sales to one of
its pharmaceutical partners. The royalty is calculated based on contracted terms of 40% of net sales for the four products,
which is to be paid quarterly to the pharmaceutical partner. In accordance with the agreement, net sales exclude fees related
to services provided by the wholesalers. Accounts payable and accrued expenses include $0.8 million and $1.0 million at
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to these royalties. Royalty expense of $0.9 million and $1.2 million was
included in cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Royalty expense of $2.2
million and $2.8 million was included in cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The Company includes significant estimates to arrive at net product sales arising from wholesaler chargebacks,
Medicaid and Medicare rebates, allowances and other pricing and promotional programs. 

Contract Manufacturing
Sales  : The Company recognizes revenue when title transfers to its customers, which is generally upon shipment of products.
These shipments are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally
or in written form. The revenues associated with these transactions, net of appropriate cash discounts, product returns and sales
reserves, are recorded upon shipment of the products and are included in product sales, net on the Company s Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Operations. 

Research and Development
Services and Other Income :   The Company establishes agreed upon product development agreements with its customers
to perform product development services. Product development revenues are recognized in accordance with the product development
agreement upon the completion of the phases of development and when the Company has no future performance obligations relating
to that phase of development. Revenue recognition requires the Company to assess progress against contracted obligations to assure
completion of each stage. These payments are generally non-refundable and are reported as deferred until they are recognizable
as revenue. If no such arrangement exists, product development fees are recognized ratably over the entire period during which
the services are performed. Other types of revenue include royalty or licensing revenue, and would be recognized based upon the
contractual agreement upon completion of the earnings process. 

Property, Plant and Equipment    

Depreciation and amortization
of property, plant and equipment is provided for under the straight-line method over the assets  estimated useful lives as
follows: 

Useful Lives    
 
      Buildings and Improvements  
      10 - 30 years   
 
      Machinery and Equipment  
       3 - 10 years   

Repair and maintenance costs
are charged to operations as incurred while major improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed, the related
cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any gains or losses are included in operating results. Interest expense
is capitalized on the portion of debt that is attributable to the expenditures for the plant expansion, related equipment and direct
personnel costs. 

Concentration of Credit Risk    

Major customers of the Company
are defined as having revenue greater than 10% of total revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, two of the Company s
customers accounted for 31% of the Company s revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, three of the Company s
customers accounted for 47% of the Company s revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, three of the Company s
customers accounted for 40% of the Company s revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, three of the Company s
customers accounted for 58% of the Company s revenue. Two of these customers are the same for both periods. Accounts receivable
related to the Company s major customers comprised 45% of all accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016. The   loss
of one or more of these customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and harm our business and results of operations .  

Expansion into foreign operations
in the fourth quarter of 2015 has generated net revenues greater than 10% outside of the United States. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, domestic net revenues were $13.5 million and foreign net revenues were $2.7 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, domestic net revenues were $41.2 million and foreign net revenues were $7.7 million. As of September 30, 2016,
domestic assets were $135.5 million and foreign assets were $51.7 million. 

Derivatives    

The Company accounts for its
derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815-10,  Derivatives and Hedging . ASC 815-10 establishes accounting
and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. ASC 815-10 also requires that changes
in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in results of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met. The Company has not entered into hedging activities to date. The Company's derivative liability was the embedded convertible
option of its Notes issued December 16, 2014 (see Note 6), which has been recorded as a liability at fair value until May 20, 2015,
and was revalued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value of the instruments included in the consolidated statements
of operations as non-operating income (expense). Due to the approval of the sufficient shares at the Company s annual shareholder
meeting, the liability for the embedded derivative was reclassified to equity on May 20, 2015. The Company has no derivatives at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Foreign Currency Translation    

The net assets of international
subsidiaries where the local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates
are recorded in the foreign currency translation account, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
reflected as a separate component of equity. For those subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
currency, non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in other (income) expense, net. 

Reclassification    

Certain prior year amounts were
reclassified to conform to current year presentation. There was no impact on the net assets or changes in net assets as a result
of the reclassification. 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements    

In February 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities . The update supersedes Topic 840, Leases and requires the recognition of lease assets and lease
liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between
finance leases and operating leases, with cash payments from operating leases classified within operating activities in the statement
of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public business
entities, which for the Company means January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
The update includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The amendments in this update are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Rescission of SEC Guidance Because
of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting (SEC Update) .
The update is a result of adoption of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. SEC Staff Observer comments found in Topic
605 are therefore not recommended to be relied upon and have been superseded. The comments are found in the following topics: 1)
Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process, 2) Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, 3) Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (including Reseller of the Vendor s Products), and 4) Accounting for Gas-Balancing
Arrangements. As these amendments require changes to the U.S. GAAP Financial Reporting Taxonomy, they will be incorporated into
the proposed 2017 Taxonomy and finalized as part of the annual release process. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .
The update addresses issues identified by the FASB-IASB Joint Transition Resource Group (TRG), a group formed in June, 2014 in
order to inform the Boards about potential implementation issues that could arise as a result of organizations implementing the
May, 2014 revenue guidance. It affects entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services within an
entity s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on
its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The update provides users with more useful information for decision making regarding
expected credit losses on financial instruments/commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures,
reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive
cash. Credit quality of the entity s assets now plays a key role in this update. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public business entities, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. For the Company, the amendments are effective January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) . The update provides users with
classification guidance on eight specific cash flow topics as follows: 1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs, 2) Settlement
of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the
Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing, 3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination, 4) Proceeds from
the Settlement of Insurance Claims, 5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned
Life Insurance Policies, 6) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees, 7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions
and 8) Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 for public business entities, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. For the Company, the amendments are effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU
on its consolidated financial statements. 

4.      Inventories  

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in-first-out method. 

Inventories
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following: 

5.      Property, Plant and Equipment  

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: 

The Company recorded depreciation
expense of $679,000 and $379,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were $139,000 of interest and $0 of interest, respectively,
capitalized into construction in progress. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were $236,000
of interest and $0 of interest, respectively, capitalized into construction in progress. 

On December 16, 2014, the Company
issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). On December
22, 2014, the Company announced the closing of the initial purchasers  exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional
$18.75 million aggregate principal amount. The Notes were offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes
were approximately $139 million, after deducting underwriting fees and other related expenses of approximately $4.8 million. Accrued
interest in the amount of $1.6 million related to the Notes was included in accrued expenses as of September 30, 2016. 

The Notes bear interest at a
fixed rate of 3.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2015,
and mature on December 15, 2019, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes are convertible into shares of the
Company s common stock, cash or a combination thereof. 

The Notes are convertible at
an initial conversion price of approximately $11.29 per share, which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of 88.5716 shares
per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in certain events, such as distributions of dividends or stock splits.
Holders may convert their Notes at their option prior to September 15, 2019, when or if certain conditions have been met or circumstances
have occurred, such as if the Company s stock price exceeds 130% of the conversion price under the Notes for a designated
period of time, or if the trading price of the Notes is, for a designated period of time, less than 98% of the closing sale price
of the Company s common stock multiplied by the then-current conversion rate of the Notes, or if the Company calls Notes
for redemption, or if certain specified corporate events occur. Holders may also convert their Notes at their option at any time
on or after September 15, 2019 and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the stated maturity
date. In addition, following the occurrence of certain changes of control of the Company described in the Indenture governing the
Notes or termination of trading of the Company s common stock or other securities into which the Notes are convertible (a
 make-whole fundamental change ) or the delivery by the Company of a notice of redemption, the conversion rate for
a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or such notice of redemption will
increase in certain circumstances. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, the Company may redeem for cash any or all outstanding
Notes on or after December 19, 2017 in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. 

The Notes and any common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, applicable state securities laws or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable
exemption from registration requirements. The Company does not intend to file a registration statement for the resale of the Notes
or any common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction
in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful. 

Since the Company did not have
sufficient authorized shares available to share-settle the conversion option in full prior to May 20, 2015, the embedded conversion
option did not qualify for equity classification and instead was separately valued and accounted for as a derivative liability.
On December 16, 2014, the initial value allocated to the derivative liability was $43.7 million of the $143.75 million principal
amount of the Notes, which represents a discount to the debt to be amortized through interest expense using the effective interest
method through the maturity of the Notes. Accordingly, the effective interest rate used to amortize the debt discount on the Notes
is 12.94%. During each reporting period through May 20, 2015, the derivative liability was marked to fair value with the change
in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. This resulted in a change in the fair value of the derivative
liability of $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and a change in the fair value of the derivative liability of $23.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

On May 20, 2015, the Company
received shareholder approval for the increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance upon
conversion of the Notes. As a result, the conversion option can now be share-settled in full, and now qualifies for equity classification,
and the bifurcated derivative liability no longer needs to be accounted for as a separate derivative on a prospective basis as
of May 20, 2015. The remaining unamortized debt discount that arose at the date of debt issuance from the original bifurcation
will continue to be amortized using the effective interest method through interest expense.  After adjusting the derivative
liability to market value on May 20, 2015, the Company reclassified the entire $18.3 million value of the derivative liability
to stockholders equity. 

The remaining unamortized discount and unamortized
debt financing costs will be amortized over the remaining term of the debt of 3.21 years. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the net carrying amount of the Notes and the remaining unamortized debt discount were as follows: 

Deferred financing costs associated
with the Notes include fees of $3.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $4.2 million at September 30, 2015. The assumptions used
in connection with the valuation of the convertible option of the Notes issued December 16, 2014, utilizing the  with 
and  without  method (discussed in Note 3) was as follows: 

For the three months and the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded the following expenses in relation to the Notes: 

(1) Included within  Interest
and other expense, net  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, offset by interest income and capitalized interest 

7.    Goodwill
and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill   

The Company acquired the assets
of Canadian pharmaceutical company Alveda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in November 2015. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded
goodwill of $0.4 million. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, and
whenever events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below
its carrying value. There have been no events or changes in circumstances that would have reduced the fair value of our reporting
unit below its carrying value from December 31, 2015, through September 30, 2016. No impairment losses were recognized during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Changes in goodwill during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): 

Intangible Assets   

The following sets forth the
major categories of the Company s intangible assets and the weighted-average remaining amortization period as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

We test for impairment of definite-lived
intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. No such triggering
events were identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and therefore no impairment loss
was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Changes in intangibles during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):      

Assuming
no additions, disposals or adjustments are made to the carrying values and/or useful lives of the intangible assets, annual amortization
expense on product rights and other related intangibles as of September 30, 2016 over the remainder of 2016 and each of the next
five years is estimated to be as follows ($ in thousands): 

*IPR D amounts will be amortized
once products become saleable, and are not included in the table above. 

8.     Stock-Based Compensation  

Stock Options  

The 1999 Director Stock Option
Plan, as amended (the  Director Plan ), provides for the grant of stock options to non-employee directors of the Company
at an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share on the date of the grant. An aggregate of 1,975,000 shares have been
approved and authorized for issuance pursuant to the Director Plan. A total of 2,634,798 options have been granted to non-employee
directors through September 30, 2016, and 807,782 of those have been forfeited through September 30, 2016 and returned to the option
pool for future issuance. The options granted under the Director Plan vest in full one year after their respective grant dates
and have a maximum term of ten years. As of September 30, 2016, there were 650,000 shares of common stock options outstanding.
As of September 30, 2016, the 147,984 options available were transferred to a plan that has superseded the Director Plan, as discussed
further in this section. 

On June 26, 2009, the Board of
Directors adopted, and the Company s stockholders subsequently approved by partial written consent, the IGI Laboratories,
Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ). The 2009 Plan became effective on July 29, 2009. The 2009 Plan allows
the Company to continue to grant options and restricted stock, as under the 1999 Plan, but also authorizes the Board of Directors
to grant a broad range of other equity-based awards, including stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ( RSUs )
and performance awards. On April 12, 2010, the Board of Directors adopted, and the Company s stockholders subsequently approved,
an amendment and restatement of the 2009 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for grant under such plan
by adding 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The 2009 Plan, as amended on May 29, 2010, authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of the
Company s common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the 2009 Plan. The maximum number of shares that may be subject
to awards made to any individual in any single calendar year under the 2009 Plan is 1,000,000 shares. As of September 30, 2016,
there were 188,234 RSUs outstanding, 1,333,412 shares of stock outstanding, and 3,280,367 shares of common stock options outstanding.
As of September 30, 2016, the 73,885 options available were transferred to a plan that has superseded the 2009 Plan, as discussed
further in this section. 

On May 25, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016
Plan ). The 2016 Plan provides for the issuance of awards of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock,
plus any shares of common stock that are represented by awards granted under our Director Plan and 2009 Plan that are forfeited,
expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock
back to the Company on or after May 25, 2016. Generally, shares of common stock reserved for awards under the 2016 Plan that lapse
or are canceled, will be added back to the share reserve available for future awards. However, shares of common stock tendered
in payment for an award or shares of common stock withheld for taxes will not be available again for grant. The 2016 Plan provides
that no participant may receive awards for more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock in any fiscal year. As the 2016 Plan supersedes
both the Director Plan and the 2009 Plan, any available shares from both are now incorporated into the 2016 Plan. As of September
30, 2016, there were 20,000 shares of common stock outstanding and options to purchase 158,500 shares of common stock outstanding.
As of September 30, 2016, there were a total of 2,043,369 shares of common stock available under the 2016 Plan. 

As of September 30, 2016,
there were options to purchase 4,088,867 shares of common stock outstanding collectively in the Director Plan, 2009 Plan, and
the 2016 Plan. 

The fair value of each option
award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula that uses assumptions noted in the following
table. Expected volatilities and risk-free interest rates are based upon the expected life of the grant. The interest rates used
are the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. 

A summary of option activity
under the Director Plan, the 2009 Plan and the 2016 Plan as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the period are presented below: 

Based upon application of the
Black-Scholes option-pricing formula described above, the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, were $3.44 and $3.83, respectively. 

The following table summarizes
information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016: 

Outstanding:   

Exercisable:   

As of September 30, 2016, the
intrinsic value of the options outstanding was $14.1 million and the intrinsic value of the options exercisable was $13.6 million.
The intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $93,329. As of September 30, 2016,
there was approximately $3.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost that will be recognized through September 2019 related
to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2016 Plan. 

Restricted Stock and RSUs  

The Company periodically grants restricted stock and RSU awards to certain officers and other employees
that typically vest one to three years from their grant date. The Company recognized $192,000 and $250,000 of compensation expense
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $564,000 and $498,000 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to restricted stock and RSU awards.  Stock compensation expense is recognized
over the vesting period of the restricted stock and RSUs.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.2 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock and RSUs, all of which will be recognized through
January 2019. 

9.      Stock Warrants  

In connection with the private
placement of the Company s common stock on December 8, 2010, the Company granted common stock warrants to purchase up to
338,182 and 16,364 shares, respectively, to each of its two placement agents for $1.21 per share, which expired on December 8,
2015. There are no stock warrant activities during 2016 and no outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company conducts operations and is subject to tax in certain foreign countries. It is the intent of
the Company to permanently reinvest any earnings and profits generated by its foreign affiliates. Additionally, one of its foreign
affiliates is subject to tax in Estonia. Estonia has a dual tax rate: 0% for earnings and profits as they are generated and 20%
for earnings and profits that are distributed to shareholders. The Company has taken the position that the 20% tax rate applies
only when dividends have been declared and recognized as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has provided no taxes on the current
earnings generated by its Estonian affiliate. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is
recognized based on the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based upon the tax rate expected for the
full calendar year applied to the pre-tax income of the interim period adjusted for discrete items. The Company excludes from the
calculation of the annual effective tax rate those jurisdictions that are projected to operate at a loss and in which a tax benefit
will not be recognized. 

At December 31, 2015, the
Company s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled $35.9 million. The Company s ability to use net operating
loss carry forwards is subject to substantial limitation in future periods under certain provisions of Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limit the utilization of net operating losses upon a more than 50% change in ownership
of the Company s stock that is held by 5% or greater stockholders. The Company examined the application of Section 382 with
respect to an ownership change that took place during 2010, as well as the limitation on the application of net operating loss
carry forwards. The Company believes that operating losses subsequent to the change date in 2010 (aggregating $7.8 million) are
not subject to Section 382 limitations. The Company has estimated that the annual limitation starting in 2010 aggregates from $1.0
million to $2.3 million per year including the effect of amortization of built in gains. The Company s loss carryforwards
may be further limited in the future if additional ownership changes occur. 

The Company is subject to the
provisions of ASC 740-10-25,   Income Taxes  . ASC 740 prescribes a more likely-than-not threshold for the financial
statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, the Company undergoes a process to evaluate whether income tax accruals are
in accordance with ASC 740 guidance on uncertain tax positions.  For federal purposes, post 1998 tax years remain open to
examination as a result of net operating loss carryforwards. The Company is currently open to audit by the appropriate state income
taxing authorities for tax years 2012 to 2014. The Company has not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions at September
30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is currently auditing the Company s 2014 income
tax return and has requested copies of the Company s 2013 and 2015 income tax returns for review purposes. The audit is currently
in the discovery phase and no issues have been raised by the IRS. 

The Company is involved from
time to time in claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company has made adequate
provision for potential liabilities, if any, arising from any such matters. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and
the costs and other effects of pending or future litigation, governmental investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings
(whether civil or criminal), settlements, judgments and investigations, claims and changes in any such matters, and developments
or assertions by or against the Company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses, could have
a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results. 

On May 21, 2015, Horizon Pharma
Ireland Limited, HZNP Limited and Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., (collectively  Horizon ), filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey against us alleging infringement of certain United States patents based upon
our submission to the U.S Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ) of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA )
seeking FDA approval to market diclofenac topical solution 2% before the expiration of the patents asserted in the complaint. 

On June 30, 2015, August 11,
2015, September 17, 2015, October 27, 2015 and February 5, 2016, Horizon filed additional complaints in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging infringement of other of its United States patents in relation
to the Company s submission of the same ANDA. 

On July 21, 2015, September 11, 2015, October 6, 2015, October 21, 2015, December 17, 2015, and March
17, 2016 the Company filed answers, affirmative defenses and counterclaims with respect to the complaints filed by Horizon. 
In those filings, the Company asserted that the patents alleged to be infringed in the complaints filed by Horizon are invalid
and not infringed by us. On April 27, 2016, Horizon and the Company filed a stipulation of dismissal to dismiss the cases. 
The court entered an order dismissing the cases on May 2, 2016. On May 9, 2016, Horizon and the Company entered into a settlement
agreement.  Under the settlement agreement, the Company obtained a license to market diclofenac topical solution 2% no later
than January 10, 2029 or earlier in certain circumstances, including the resolution by settlement or court decision of other third
party litigation involving diclofenac topical solution 2% or the market entry by other third party generic versions of diclofenac
topical solution 2%. At this time, the Company cannot estimate if or when any of those earlier events might occur. No consideration
was exchanged as part of the settlement and the company has not recorded accruals related to this case. 

On December 4, 2015, Galderma
Laboratories, L.P. and Galderma S.A., collectively referred to as Galderma, filed a complaint in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Texas against the Company alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 6,106,848 based upon the
Company s submission to the FDA of an ANDA seeking FDA approval to market clobetasol propionate lotion 0.05% before the expiration
patent asserted in the complaint. On January 5, 2016, Galderma and the Company entered into a Settlement and License Agreement,
the terms of which are confidential. On January 22, 2016, the case was dismissed with prejudice. 

12.      Asset Purchase Agreements  

Sebela   

On March 31, 2016, the Company
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and certain other ancillary agreements with Sebela International Limited, an Irish company
resident in Bermuda (  Sebela  ). The Company acquired all rights, title and interests of Sebela in its existing
inventory and certain of its contracts associated with two medical devices, which the Company had previously developed. 

The transaction is accounted
for as a purchase of the product and product rights, and as such the initial payment and related costs to acquire the assets (excluding
inventory) are included as part of product acquisition costs totaling $330,000. The Company will amortize the costs over fifteen
years, the useful life of the acquired products and products rights. In addition, the Company purchased approximately $69,000 of
inventory related to the products acquired. 

AstraZeneca   

On September 24, 2014, the Company
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with AstraZeneca in which the Company acquired all rights, title, and interests of AstraZeneca
and its affiliates in Abbreviated New Drug Applications and New Drug Applications associated with eighteen products (collectively
the  Purchased Regulatory Approvals ) and certain documents relating thereto (together with the Purchased Regulatory
Approvals, the  Purchased Assets ). 

The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase of the product and product rights, and as such the initial payment, related costs to acquire the
assets, and a milestone payment were all included as part of product acquisition costs totaling $6.9 million. In addition,
the Company agreed to pay, for each product manufactured by the Company pursuant to a Purchased Regulatory Approval, a
royalty on future gross profits from product sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as amended in the First Amendment to the
Asset Purchase Agreement, by and between the Company and AstraZeneca, dated November 13, 2015, the Company at any time prior
to June 30, 2016, could satisfy in full its royalty obligations with a single payment of $3.0 million. The Company elected to
make the single payment as of June 30, 2016, bringing the total costs related to the asset purchase to $9.9 million and
relieving the Company from any future royalties to AstraZeneca. 

ITEM   2.    Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Company Overview   

Strategic Overview   

Teligent, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(collectively the  Company ) is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company. Our mission is to become a leader in the
specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded and generic
injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada.  In the United States, we currently market twelve generic
topical pharmaceutical products and four branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products.  Through the completion of an
acquisition, we now sell a total of twenty generic and branded generic injectable products and medical devices in Canada. 
Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts.  We also provide development, formulation,
and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter ( OTC ), and cosmetic markets.  We operate
our business under one segment. Effective October 23, 2015, we changed our name from IGI Laboratories, Inc. to Teligent, Inc. 
On October 26, 2015, our common stock, which was previously listed on the NYSE MKT, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
under the trading symbol  TLGT.   Our office, laboratories and manufacturing facilities are located at 105 Lincoln
Avenue, Buena, New Jersey. 

Currently, we have two platforms for growth: 

Developing, manufacturing and marketing a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products in our own label in topical, injectable, complex and ophthalmic dosage forms; and,   

Managing our current contract manufacturing and formulation services business.   

We have been in the contract
manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused
on the growth of our own generic specialty pharmaceutical business. Since 2010, we have focused on transitioning our business to
include more customers in the topical prescription pharmaceutical industry. In 2014, we broadened our target product focus from
topical pharmaceuticals to include a wider specialty pharmaceutical approach. We believe that expanding our development and commercial
base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics, complex generics and
ophthalmic generics (what we call our  TICO strategy ), will leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and
broaden our platform for more diversified strategic growth. 

As of the date of this report, we have 25 drug products that
have been previously approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and six drug products that have been
previously approved by Health Canada. Our pipeline includes 34 Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs ) filed with
the FDA, for additional pharmaceutical products. We have an additional 34 product candidates at various stages of our development
pipeline. We have also experienced an increased rate of review by the FDA of applications filed in Generic Drug User Fee Amendments
( GDUFA ), Year 3 and Year 4, which began October 1, 2014, and October 1, 2015, respectively. We submitted six ANDAs
in the first nine months of 2016. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical pharmaceutical market through
the filing of additional ANDAs with the FDA and the subsequent launch of products as these applications are approved. Our target
is to file at least fifteen ANDAs in total in 2016 through our internal product development program, and we plan to submit 8 regulatory
filings with Health Canada in 2016. We will also seek to license or acquire further products, intellectual property, or pending
applications to expand our portfolio. 

The manufacturing and commercialization
of generic specialty pharmaceutical markets is competitive, and there are established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors
actively engaged in all phases of our business. We currently only manufacture and sell topical generic pharmaceutical products.
We have also started selling injectable products as of the fourth quarter of 2015, consistent with our TICO strategy. We have
made significant progress on our facility expansion in Buena, New Jersey, to support our increased activity. As we continue to
execute our TICO strategy, we will compete in other markets, including the ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical market, and expect
to face other competitors. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, we had sales to two customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers were
two of the three large wholesale drug distributors. These customers had sales of $2.9 million, and $2.0 million, respectively,
and represented 31% of total revenues. Accounts receivable related to these major customers comprised 45% of all accounts receivable
as of September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, 36% of our total product sales, net were to one of the
three large wholesale drug distributors. The three large wholesale drug distributors are: AmerisourceBergen Corporation ( ABC ),
Cardinal Health, Inc. ( Cardinal ), and McKesson Drug Company ( McKesson ). ABC accounted for approximately
42% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 40% of our total product
sales, net were to two of those three large wholesale drug distributors noted below. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
50% of our total product sales, net were to one of the three large wholesale drug distributors. 

ABC, Cardinal and
McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies.
None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally, if sales to any one of these distributors were to
diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products
either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a
delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on
our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, ABC, Cardinal and McKesson have
recently entered into strategic alliances with Walgreens, CVS Caremark,  Rite-Aid, and Wal-Mart,
respectively.  Since Walgreens, CVS Caremark and Rite-Aid are customers for several of our products, the loss of
our distributor relationship with any of the three large wholesalers could result in a reduction to our revenues. 

We consider our business relationships
with ABC, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change
in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products
and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue,
business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to seek to diversify our existing portfolio of specialty
generic drug products through internal research and development, we expect to file up to 15 ANDAs in 2016. In addition, we continue
to explore business development opportunities to add additional products and or capabilities to our existing portfolio. 

Our customers in the contract manufacturing business
generally consist of pharmaceutical companies, as well as cosmetic and OTC product marketers, who require product development/manufacturing
support. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 78% of our contract manufacturing revenue was derived from
pharmaceutical customers, as compared to 91% of total contract manufacturing revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 90% of our contract manufacturing revenue was derived from pharmaceutical
customers, as compared to 85% of total contract manufacturing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. None of our
contract manufacturing services customers represented greater than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and one contract manufacturing services customer represented greater than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. One of our contract manufacturing services customers represented 11% of total revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and one of our contract manufacturing services customers represented 11% of total revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Recent Events   

On May 16, 2016, we announced
approval of an ANDA for Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP, 0.1%. This is our fifth approval from our internally developed pipeline
of topical generic pharmaceutical products. We launched Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP, 0.1% in the second quarter of 2016. 

On July 8, 2016, we announced
approvals of two ANDAs: Triamcinolone Acetonide Lotion USP, 0.1% and Triamcinolone Acetonide Lotion USP, 0.025%. The FDA has now
approved seven ANDAs from our internally developed pipeline of topical generic pharmaceutical products. Triamcinolone Acetonide
Lotion USP, 0.1% and Triamcinolone Acetonide Lotion USP, 0.025% were both launched in the third quarter of 2016. 

On August 23, 2016, we announced
approval from Health Canada of a New Drug Submission ( NDS ) for our Estonian subsidiary: Gentamicin Injection USP
40mg/mL in 2mL ampoules. On August 25, 2016, we announced Health Canada s approvals of three Abbreviated New Drug Submissions
( ANDS ) for our Estonian subsidiary: Baclofen Injection 0.05mg/mL, Baclofen Injection 0.5mg/mL and Baclofen Injection
2mg/mL. On September 30, 2016, we announced approval from Health Canada for Lidocaine Hydrochloride Topical Solution USP. On October
5, 2016, we announced approval from Health Canada for Lidocaine Ointment USP 5%. All six of these are the first approvals for our
Estonian subsidiary and will all be distributed by our business in Canada. We expect all six of these products to be launched in
2017. 

Results of Operations   

Three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015   

We had a net loss of $2.7 million,
or $0.05 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.05 per share,
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which resulted from the following: 

Revenues (in thousands):   

Revenues were $16.2 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.6 million for the same period in the prior year. This represents
a $4.6 million increase in 2016 from 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our own generic pharmaceutical
product line and our entry in to the specialty generic injectable market in the U.S. and Canada. This increase was slightly offset
by a decrease in contract manufacturing revenues for the same period in the prior year, specifically a decline in sales to one
of our customers. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expect contract manufacturing revenue as a percentage of total revenue
to decline over time. 

Research and development services
and other income will not be consistent and will vary, from period to period, depending on the required timeline of each development
project and/or agreement. 

Costs and Expenses (in
thousands):   

Cost of sales increased for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the increase in total revenue. Cost of
sales increased as a percentage of total revenue to 50% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 48% for same
period in 2015. This increase in cost of revenue as a percent of sales was primarily due to increased revenue from our own generic
pharmaceutical product line driven by new product launches and our entry into the specialty generic injectable market as well as
changes in product pricing and related fees, such as wholesaler fees. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expect cost
of sales as a percentage of total revenue to decline over time. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1.3 million as compared to the same period in 2015. In 2016,
there were increases of $0.7 million in amortization expense related to assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, $0.3 million
in salaries and related costs, $0.3 million in expenses related to our Canadian operations, $0.1 million in recruiting fees, $0.2
million in other corporate expenses and $0.2 million in expenses related to our Estonia operations offset by a decrease in professional
fees of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in stock based compensation related to options and restricted stock. 

Product development and research
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.8 million as compared to the same period in 2015. 
 Consistent with our strategy to expand our portfolio of generic prescription pharmaceutical products, we increased clinical
study expense by $0.2 million. We continued to hire to support our strategy, which resulted in an increase of $0.5 million in
salaries and related costs, an increase of $0.3 million in exhibit batch costs, an increase of $0.2 million in expenses related
to Canadian operations, an increase of $0.1 million in stock based compensation related to options and restricted stock, and a
$0.1 million increase in overhead costs. These were offset by decreases in consulting fees of $0.3 million, pilot batch study
costs of $0.1 million, professional fees of $0.1 million, and fees related to GDUFA and the associated filing of our applications
with the FDA of $0.1 million. 

Other Income
(Expense) (in thousands):   

Interest
expense increased by $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase
is related to the interest expense, amortization of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs of the Notes (see Note
6), partially offset by capitalized interest of our facility expansion and interest income from the intercompany loan. Foreign
exchange gain of $0.4 million was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to the foreign currency
translation of our intercompany loans denominated in U.S. dollars to our foreign subsidiaries. These loans are to be repaid in
November 2022.  

Net  Loss
(in thousands, except per share numbers):   

Net loss for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $2.7 million as compared to a net loss of $2.9 million in the same period last year. The decrease
is due to increases in revenues and foreign currency exchange gain in the amount of $0.4 million, offset by the increases in costs
and expenses in 2016, noted above. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to September 30, 2015   

We had a net loss of $6.6 million,
or $0.12 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $13.0 million, or $0.25 per share,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which resulted from the following: 

Revenues
(in thousands):   

Revenues were $49.0 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $31.2 million for the same period in the prior year. This represents a $17.8
million increase in 2016 from 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our own generic pharmaceutical product
line and our entry in to the specialty generic injectable market in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, our contract manufacturing
revenues increased over the same period in the prior year, primarily due to our acquisition of two new customers, one in the fourth
quarter of 2015 and one within the first six months of 2016, for which we manufactured one of our generic topical products in a
private label, offset by a slight decline in purchase orders. 

Research and development services
and other income will not be consistent and will vary, from period to period, depending on the required timeline of each development
project and/or agreement. 

Costs and Expenses
(in thousands):   

Cost of sales increased for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the increase in total revenue. Cost of sales
decreased as a percentage of total revenue to 48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 51% for same period
in 2015. This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the increased revenue from our own generic
pharmaceutical product line driven by new product launches and our entry in to the specialty generic injectable market. Sales related
to our own label products generally have lower cost of sales percentages than our contract manufacturing product revenues; however,
sales to one new contract manufacturing customer, where we sold more of our generic products in a private label, did reduce cost
of sales as a percentage of sales. In addition, in the first nine months of 2016, our costs of revenue include the write-down of
the inventory step up in basis in the amount of $0.5 million.  The inventory step-up was initially recorded in connection
with our acquisition of Alveda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in November 2015.  Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expect
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue to decline over time. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $4.3 million as compared to the same period in 2015. In 2016,
there were increases of $2.1 million in amortization expense related to assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, $1.0 million
in expenses related to our Canadian operations, $0.3 million in salaries and related costs, other corporate expenses of $0.3 million,
$0.3 million in recruiting fees, $0.1 million in conferences and seminars, $0.1 million in board of directors fees, $0.1 million
in occupancy and business insurance, $0.3 million in expenses related to our Estonia operations offset by a decrease in professional
fees of $0.3 million. 

Product development and research
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $3.2 million as compared to the same period in 2015. Consistent
with our strategy to expand our portfolio of generic prescription pharmaceutical products, we increased headcount, which resulted
in an increase of $1.5 million in salaries and related costs, $1.0 million increase in clinical studies, $0.7 million increase
in exhibit batch costs, an increase of $0.5 million in expenses related to Canadian operations, $0.4 million increase in stock
based compensation related to options and restricted stock, $0.1 million fees related to GDUFA and the associated filing of our
applications with the FDA, $0.1 million increase in professional fees, and a $0.2 million increase in overhead costs. These were
partially offset by decreases in consulting fees of $0.9 million, pilot batch study costs of $0.3 million and technology license
fees of $0.1 million. 

Other Income
(Expense) (in thousands):   

Interest expense increased by
$0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase is related to the
interest expense, amortization of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs of the Notes (see Note 6), partially offset
by capitalized interest related to our facility expansion and interest income from the intercompany loan. Foreign exchange gain
of $1.3 million was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to the foreign currency translation
of our intercompany loans denominated in U.S. dollars to our foreign subsidiaries. These loans are to be repaid in November 2022.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $23.1 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability
as a result of the change in the fair value of our derivative liability, caused primarily by the decrease in the price of our common
stock. Due to the approval of the sufficient shares at the Company s annual shareholder meeting, the liability for the embedded
derivative was reclassified to equity on May 20, 2015, and as such there is no change in the fair value of the derivative liability
recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net (Loss) Income
(in thousands, except per share numbers):   

Net loss for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $6.6 million as compared to net income of $13.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease
is due to increases in costs and expenses in 2016 and the change in the fair value of derivative liability in 2015 in the amount
of $23.1 million, partially offset by foreign currency exchange gain of $1.3 million noted above and increases in revenues in 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our cash
flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized
in the following table (in thousands): 

Operating
Activities   

Our operating
activities provided $3.0 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.8 million of cash provided
by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The cash provided by operating activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was a result of the non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including
the receipt of $4.4 million Goods and Services Tax (GST) refund from the Canadian Revenue Agency, originally paid during the Alveda
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. The cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
was a result of the net income, offset by the change in the fair value of derivative liability and the non-cash expenses and changes
in operating assets and liabilities for the period. 

Investing Activities   

Our investing activities used
$15.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.8 million of cash used in investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The funds used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $12.2 million for
capital expenditures, mainly related to the ongoing facility expansion, $3.0 million for the royalty payment to AstraZeneca (see
Note 12), $0.3 million for the asset purchase of all rights, title and interests of Sebela (see Note 12), and $0.1 million related
to other investments. The funds used for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were for the purchase of two additional products
and capital expenditures related to additional equipment for the compounding and packaging areas and additional IT equipment. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid the additional aggregate of $6.0 million that was payable at the time
of the Company s first filing with the FDA related to any asset purchased from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP. 

Financing Activities   

Our financing activities used
$71,000 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.3 million of cash used during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly $70,000 of principal payments on capital
lease obligations and $36,000 in expenses related to recovery from a stockholder offset by proceeds from the exercise of options
to purchase common stock of $35,000. The cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly the $3,160,000 principal
payment on the note payable and $98,000 principal payments on capital lease obligations. 

Our principal sources of liquidity
are cash and cash equivalents of approximately $74.6 million at September 30, 2016 and future cash from operations. Our working
capital was $94.3 million at September 30, 2016. 

We may require additional funding
and this funding will depend, in part, on the timing and structure of potential business arrangements. If necessary, we may continue
to seek to raise additional capital through the sale of its equity or through a strategic alliance with a third party. There may
also be additional acquisition and growth opportunities that may require external financing. There can be no assurance that such
financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient
to support our current business plan beyond November 2017. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
as of the date of this report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our condensed consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates
and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. 

Please refer to our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a complete list of all Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. See also
Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

As of September 30, 2016, our principal
debt obligation was related to our Notes.  Interest accrues at a fixed rate of 3.75% on the outstanding principal amount
of the Notes and is paid semi-annually every June 15 and December 15 until the Notes mature on December 15, 2019.  Since
the interest rate is fixed, we have no market risk related to the Notes. 

Our revolving Credit Agreement with General
Electric Capital Corporation, as agent (the  Agent ), and GE Capital Bank and the other financial institutions party
thereto, as lenders (the  Lenders ), called for interest to accrue based on a premium above either the current prime
rate or current LIBOR rates.  Therefore, borrowings pursuant to this revolving credit facility were subject to market
risk.  We terminated the Credit Agreement in February 2016. 

Our financial instruments include cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the Notes. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate book value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  Based on
the closing price of our common stock as of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our Notes was approximately $112.6 million compared
to their face value of $143.75 million as of September 30, 2016.  However, this variance is due to the conversion feature
in the Notes rather than to changes in market interest rates.  As noted above, the Notes carry a fixed interest rate
and therefore do not subject us to interest rate risk. 

ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September
30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

There was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting during our third quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II  

  OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings  

We are involved from time to time in claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, we have made adequate provision for potential liabilities,
if any, arising from any such matters. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the costs and other effects of pending
or future litigation, governmental investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil or criminal),
settlements, judgments and investigations, claims and changes in any such matters, and developments or assertions by or against
us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results. 

On May 21, 2015, Horizon Pharma Ireland
Limited, HZNP Limited and Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., (collectively  Horizon ), filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against us alleging infringement of certain United States patents based upon our
submission to the FDA of an ANDA seeking FDA approval to market diclofenac topical solution 2% before the expiration of the patents
asserted in the complaint. On June 30, 2015, August 11, 2015, September 17, 2015, October 27, 2015 and February 5, 2016, Horizon
filed additional complaints in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against us alleging infringement
of other of its United States patents in relation to our submission of the same ANDA. On July 21, 2015, September 11, 2015, October
6, 2015, October 21, 2015, December 17, 2015, and March 17, 2016 we filed answers, affirmative defenses and counterclaims with
respect to the complaints filed by Horizon.  In those filings, we asserted that the patents alleged to be infringed in the
complaints filed by Horizon are invalid and not infringed by us. 

On April 27, 2016, Horizon and the Company
filed a stipulation of dismissal to dismiss the cases.  The court entered an order dismissing the cases on May 2, 2016. On
May 9, 2016, Horizon and the Company entered into a settlement agreement.  Under the settlement agreement, we obtained a license
to market diclofenac topical solution 2% no later than January 10, 2029 or earlier in certain circumstances, including the resolution
by settlement or court decision of other third party litigation involving diclofenac topical solution 2% or the market entry by
other third party generic versions of diclofenac topical solution 2%. At this time, we cannot estimate if or when any of those
earlier events might occur. 

On December 4, 2015, Galderma Laboratories,
L.P. and Galderma S.A., (collectively  Galderma ), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas against us alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 6,106,848 based upon our submission to the FDA
of an ANDA seeking FDA approval to market clobetasol propionate lotion 0.05% before the expiration patent asserted in the complaint.
On January 5, 2016, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Galderma, the terms of which are confidential. On
January 22, 2016, the case was dismissed with prejudice. 

ITEM 1A.   
       Risk Factors.    

Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors, 
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties
which could adversely affect our future results. Except as set forth below, the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 have not materially changed. 

Risks Related to Our Business  

We rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion
of our revenues.  

We depend on a limited number of customers
for a large portion of our revenue. Two of our customers accounted for 31% of our revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and three of our customers accounted for 47% of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, three of our customers accounted for 40% of our revenue and for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, three of our customers accounted for 58% of our revenue. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant
impact on our revenues and harm our business and results of operations. 

We had net revenue from one product, econazole
nitrate cream, which accounted for 5% and 52% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and 10% and 52% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we had net revenue from lidocaine ointment, which accounted for 34% of total revenues, which we launched at
the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

We have a history of losses and cannot
assure you that we will become profitable, and as a result, we may have to cease operations and liquidate our business.  

Prior to 2014, our expenses have exceeded
our revenue in each of the last nine years, and no net income has been available to common stockholders during each of these years.
As of September 30, 2016, our stockholders  equity was $61.7 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $39.5 million.
Our future profitability depends on revenue exceeding expenses, but we cannot assure you that this will occur. If we do not become
profitable or continue to raise external financing, we could be forced to curtail operations and sell or liquidate our business,
and you could lose some or all of your investment. 

The Company is exposed to market risk
from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  

The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions
denominated in currencies of the local jurisdiction. Additionally, the Company may enter into acquisition, licensing, borrowing
or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency exposure. Since the Company cannot, with certainty, foresee and
mitigate against such adverse fluctuations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively affect the Company s
results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

Risks Related to the Notes  

We may not have the ability to raise
the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes, purchase the Notes as required pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing
the Notes or pay the redemption price for any Notes we redeem, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay
cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.  

On December 16, 2014, we completed the
sale of $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the  Notes ) to Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as the initial purchasers and on December 22, 2014, we issued to the initial
purchasers an additional $18.75 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing
the Notes, following a certain events, holders of notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes for cash. Such
event may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing
indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay
the purchase price in cash with respect to any notes surrendered by holders for purchase at that time, make cash payments upon
conversions or pay the redemption price for any notes we redeem. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities
or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the notes (even if required pursuant to the terms of the indenture),
make cash payments upon conversions of the notes or pay the redemption price for any notes we redeem would result in an event of
default with respect to the notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any.
If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have
sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes, make cash payments upon conversions thereof or pay the redemption
price for any notes we redeem. 

Servicing our debt requires a significant
amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.  

Our ability to make scheduled payments
of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of or to refinance our indebtedness, including the
Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary
capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as
selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our
ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be
able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on
our debt obligations. 

To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy
all or a portion of our conversion obligation, conversions of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders,
including holders who had previously converted their Notes.  

The holders of our Notes can require us,
under certain circumstances, to convert their Notes. We have the option to satisfy this conversion obligation with cash, shares
of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election. To the extent we issue shares of our
common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, the conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the
ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion
could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short
selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock. 

Our substantial indebtedness could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under
the Notes.  

After giving effect to the issuance of the Notes, we will have
a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness was $143.75 million. Our substantial
level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal
of, interest on, or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other financial
obligations and contractual commitments, may have a material adverse impact on us. For example, it could 

make
it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding and other future debt obligations;  

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions or a downturn in the industries in which we operate;  

impair
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate
purposes;  

require
us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to the payment to our financing sources, thereby reducing the availability
of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and  

place
us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors.  

Risks Related to Our Securities  

Shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid which
may affect the trading price of our common stock.  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was approximately 311,376 shares.
As a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader
public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the
trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. 

Our stock price is, and we expect it
to remain, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of common stock
at or above the price for which they were acquired.  

Our stock price is, and we expect it to
remain, volatile, which could limit investors  ability to sell stock at a profit. During the last two fiscal years, our stock
price has closed at a low of $2.93 in the first quarter of 2014 and a high of $11.52 in the first quarter of 2015. The volatile
price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment, to sell shares at a profit at any
given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance. A variety of factors may affect the market price of our common stock. These
include, but are not limited to: 

publicity
regarding actual or potential clinical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;  

delay
or failure in initiating, completing or analyzing nonclinical or clinical trials or the unsatisfactory design or results of these
trials;  

achievement
or rejection of regulatory approvals by our competitors or us;  

announcements
of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;  

developments
concerning proprietary rights, including patents;  

developments
concerning our collaborations;  

regulatory
developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;  

economic
or other crises, especially given the recent financial deterioration in the markets in which we compete, and other external factors;  

stock
market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical
and consumer products industry;  

actual
or anticipated sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders;  

period-to-period
fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations; and  

speculation
about our business in the press or the investment community.
