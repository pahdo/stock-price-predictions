1.   
       Nature
    of Operations    

Ecosciences,
Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 26, 2010. The Company s principal business
is focused on the development, production and sale of environmentally focused wastewater products. It currently produces organic
tablets and powders to be used regularly and in lieu of harmful chemical cleaning products in grease trap and septic tank systems.
The Company intends to generate revenue through the sale of tablets and powders to domestic and international customers in the
food and sanitation industries as well as residential consumers.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a recurring nature considered necessary to present fairly the Company s
financial position and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods shown.  

The
preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year.  

2.   
       Going
    Concern    

These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant
revenue since inception and has not generated significant earnings. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to
continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has accumulated losses of
$1,202,134 and a working capital deficit of $1,082,292. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

*     On
                                         May 9, 2014, the Company entered into a Master Loan Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ),
                                         whereby the lender agreed, from time to time, to purchase from the Company one or more
                                         Promissory Notes for the account of the Company, provided, however, that the aggregate
                                         principal amount of all Promissory Notes then outstanding shall not exceed $500,000 and
                                         that no Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured. Amounts borrowed under the
                                         Loan Agreement are evidenced by an unsecured, non-recourse Promissory Note, bearing interest
                                         at a rate of 8% per annum, maturing on the first anniversary date thereof, and may be
                                         prepaid by the Company before the maturity date. Amounts borrowed under the Loan Agreement
                                         and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. The Loan Agreement will automatically terminate
                                         and be of no further force and effect upon the earlier to occur of (i) the satisfaction
                                         of all indebtedness, including the promissory notes and any additional indebtedness issued
                                         thereafter, between the Company and the lender and (ii) written termination notice is
                                         delivered by the Company or the lender to the other party. Two notes matured in May 2015
                                         and were not repaid. Therefore, under the default terms of the Loan Agreement, all remaining
                                         promissory notes immediately become due and payable.

g)  
      On
    July 19, 2016, the Company entered a Securities Purchase Agreement whereas the Company agreed to issue two Convertible Redeemable
    Notes for an aggregate of $121,000. The Convertible Redeemable Notes bear interest at 12% per annum and contain a 10% original
    issue discount, such that the purchase price of each $60,500 note is $55,000. The principal amount and any interest thereon
    are due one year following the borrowing date. During the first six months that the first Convertible Redeemable Note is in
    effect, the Company may redeem the Note at 140% of the par value plus accrued interest. The first of the two Convertible Redeemable
    Notes was paid to the Company on July 19, 2016. The second Convertible Redeemable Note ( Back-End Note ) shall
    initially be paid for by an offsetting $55,000 promissory note issued to the Company by the lender, provided that prior to
    the conversion of the Back-End Note, the lender must have paid off the promissory note in cash. Payment to the Company under
    the promissory note must be no later than April 19, 2017. As of October 27, 2016 the second Convertible Redeemable Note has
    not funded. The promissory note will initially be secured by the pledge of the Back-End Note. Pursuant to the agreements,
    the Convertible Redeemable Notes are convertible into shares of common stock at any time at a conversion price equal to 50%
    of the average of the three lowest trading prices of the common stock for the twenty prior trading days including the day
    upon which a notice of conversion is received by the Company. In connection with the first Convertible Redeemable Note, the
    Company incurred financing costs of $3,000 and an original issue discount of $5,500, which have been recorded as a discount.

The
    embedded conversion option qualifies for derivative accounting and bifurcation under ASC 815-15  Derivatives and Hedging .
    The initial fair value of the conversion feature of $90,990 resulted in an additional discount to the note payable of $52,000
    and the remaining $38,990 was recognized as a loss on changes in fair value of derivative liability. During the three months
    ended August 31, 2016, the Company recorded accretion of $11,479 increasing the carrying value of the note to $11,479. At
    August 31, 2016, the Company owed accrued interest of $855.   

h)  
      On
    July 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note agreement for $56,750. The principal amount and any
    interest thereon are due nine months following the borrowing date. The Note bears interest at 12% per annum, increasing to
    24% per annum if any principal or interest in not paid when due. For the first 180 days, the Company has the right to prepay
    the Note of up to 150% of all amounts owed. Pursuant to the agreement, the Note is convertible into shares of common stock
    at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price of the common stock during the
    25 trading days prior to the issue date and (ii) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price of the common stock during the
    25 trading day period prior to conversion. The Company incurred financing costs of $6,750 which has been recorded as a discount.   

The
    embedded conversion option qualifies for derivative accounting and bifurcation under ASC 815-15  Derivatives and Hedging .
    The initial fair value of the conversion feature of $79,631 resulted in an additional discount to the note payable of $50,000
    and the remaining $29,631 was recognized as a loss on changes in fair value of derivative liability. During the three months
    ended August 31, 2016, the Company recorded accretion of $13,212 increasing the carrying value of the note to $13,212. At
    August 31, 2016, the Company owed accrued interest of $802.   

7.   
       Derivative
    Liabilities    

The
embedded conversion options of the Company s convertible debentures described in Note 6 contain conversion features that
qualify for embedded derivative classification. The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end of every reporting
period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial
instruments.  

The
table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities:

7.   
       Derivative
    Liabilities (continued)    

The
Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the warrant derivative liabilities and embedded conversion option
liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on various assumptions.
The model incorporates the price of a share of the Company s common stock (as quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board),
volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result
in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations:  

8.   
       Preferred
    Stock    

a)  
      On
    June 4, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the  Amendment ) to its Certificate of Designation
    for the Company s Series C convertible preferred stock originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April
    20, 2015. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company increased the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion
    of each share of Series C preferred stock from 10 shares to 12 shares but also added the restriction that the holder has to
    wait until the one year anniversary date of issuance before the holder can elect to convert. Also, the Company removed the
    right of the holder to elect to have any portion of the shares be repurchased by the Company at $0.10 per share, and amended
    the voting rights to increase the voting equivalency of each share of Series C preferred stock from 10 shares to 12 shares
    of common stock.   

b)  
      On
    June 4, 2015, the Company designated 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series D convertible preferred stock. The holders
    of the Series D convertible preferred stock may elect to convert their shares at any time and from time to time and after
    the first year anniversary of the issue date. Each share of Series D convertible preferred stock is convertible into 10 shares
    of common stock of the Company; provided, however, that the holder is prohibited from converting such number of shares of
    Series D convertible preferred stock that would result in the stockholder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the common
    stock of the Company. The holders of the Series D convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to a number of votes equal
    to the number of shares of common stock into which the Series D shares held are convertible.   

c)  
      On
    June 4, 2015, upon execution of the Management Services Agreement referred to in Note 9 (a), the Company issued 100,000 shares
    of the Series D convertible preferred stock to the President of the Company at $0.10 per share in exchange for management
    services.   

d)  
      On
    June 4, 2015, upon execution of the Services Agreements referred to in Note 9 (b), the Company issued 400,000 shares of the
    Series D convertible preferred stock to persons or companies at $0.10 per share in exchange for services.   

e)  
      On
    June 11, 2015, upon execution of the Services Agreements referred to in Notes 9 (d) and (e), the Company issued 110,000 shares
    of the Series D convertible preferred stock to persons or companies at $0.10 per share in exchange for services.   

f)  
      On
    September 11, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the  Amendment ) to amend the provisions of
    the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation for the Company s Series A convertible preferred
    stock originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on May 8, 2014. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company restated
    the conversion and redemption terms of the Series A convertible preferred stock. For shares of Series A convertible preferred
    stock issued prior to September 11, 2015, the holders shall have the right to convert the shares from the first anniversary
    date of issuance. For shares of Series A convertible preferred stock issued on or after September 11, 2015, the holders shall
    have the right to convert the shares from October 1, 2016. The Company may also redeem all, or any portion of, the outstanding
    shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for $0.40 per share.   

g)  
      On
    September 11, 2015, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, whereby the Company issued 125,000 shares of Series
    A preferred stock at $0.20 per share for proceeds of $25,000.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

You
should read the following discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors
we describe in this report and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Forward
Looking Statements    

Some
of the information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can
identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate  and  continue,  or similar words. You should read statements that contain
these words carefully because they:  

discuss
    our future expectations;   

contain
    projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition; and   

state
    other  forward-looking  information.   

We
believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately
predict or over which we have no control. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this Report.  

Unless
stated otherwise, the words  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  or  Ecosciences 
in this section collectively refer to Ecosciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eco-Logical Concepts, Inc., a Delaware
corporation.  

Corporate
History    

We
were formerly known as On-Air Impact, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( On-Air Impact ). From the date of our inception
on May 26, 2010 until the consummation of the reverse merger described below on May 9, 2014, On-Air Impact had been a  shell
company  (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )).  

On
May 9, 2014, On-Air Impact and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eco Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Merger Sub ),
consummated a reverse merger (the  Merger ) with Eco-Logical Concepts, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Eco-Logical ),
pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 9, 2014 (the  Merger Agreement ),
whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Eco-Logical with Eco-Logical being the surviving corporation and replacing Merger Sub
as On-Air Impact s wholly-owned subsidiary. Since the Merger, the business and operations of Eco-Logical have been business
and operations of On-Air Impact.  

At
the closing of the Merger:  

Every
    one hundred (100) shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Eco-Logical issued and outstanding immediately prior
    to the closing of the Merger was converted into one (1) share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common
    Stock ), of On-Air Impact, rounding up to the nearest whole number for resulting fractional shares; and   

Each
    share of Series A Non-Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Eco-Logical issued and outstanding immediately
    prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into one share of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001
    per share (the  Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock ), of On-Air Impact.   

In
addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 9, 2014, Joel Falitz, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Eco-Logical,
was appointed to serve as the Chairman of our Board of Directors for a one-year period until the next annual stockholders 
meeting or until his successor is elected and qualified and as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer
of the Company.  

As
a result of the Merger, On-Air Impact ceased to be a shell company. The information contained in our  Super Form 8-K 
filed on May 15, 2014 constitutes the current  Form 10 information  necessary to satisfy the conditions contained
in Rule 144(i)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ).  

The
Merger was intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes. Even though On-Air Impact was the
legal acquirer, Eco-Logical is considered to be the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the Company s historical financial
statements before the Merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Eco-Logical before the Merger in this
Report and all future filings with the SEC.  

To
better reflect our new operations as a result of the Merger, on June 23, 2014, the Company changed its name from  On-Air
Impact  to  Ecosciences, Inc.  On June 23, 2014, we also increased our authorized capital stock from 100 million
shares of Common Stock to 500 million shares; and from 10 million shares of  blank check  Preferred Stock, par value
$0.0001 per share ( Preferred Stock ) to 50 million shares. We also effectuated a 500-for-1 forward stock split of
our outstanding Common Stock on June 23, 2014 (the  Forward Stock Split ).  

On
July 21, 2014, the ticker symbol of our Common Stock on the OTCQB was changed from  OAIR  to  ECEZ  to
better reflect our new name.  

As
a result of the Merger and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of the past financial results of On-Air Impact,
Inc. is not pertinent, and under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the historical financial results
of Eco-Logical, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.  

The
following discussion highlights Ecosciences  results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our consolidated
financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management
believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented
herein. The following discussion and analysis is based on Ecosciences  unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contained in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.  

Overview    

Our
wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Eco-Logical Concepts Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the  Company,   Eco, 
 Eco-Logical,   our,  we,   us,  and similar terms), was incorporated in the state of
Delaware on November 30, 2011.  

Located
in Jericho, New York, Eco-Logical provides bio-remediation services for sewers, sludge ponds, septic tanks, lagoons, farms, car
washes, portable sanitation facilities, grease tanks, lakes and ponds. We provide a suite of tablet-based products that can be
added to waste systems. The active ingredients in our tablets oxygenate wastewater, remove hydrogen sulfide odors, prevent corrosion
in wastewater systems and initiate aerobic biological breakdown of organic sludge including fats, oils and grease. The tablets
are non-toxic to the environment, non-caustic and comprised of natural ingredients that do not require any special permitting
for use and disposal. The product is simple to use directly by the end consumer.  

The
Company s bioremediation products are sold under the brands Trap-Eze, Sept-Eze, Tank-Eze and Wash-Eze.  

The
Company has formulated a business model that management believes can help it grow and achieve economies of scale over time. We
have undertaken the necessary due diligence and prepared a business that will enable us to compete in the market for bio-remediation
services.  

The
Company is focused on building, acquiring and investing in businesses around ecological and life sciences. From waste water remediation
to healthcare and more, Ecosciences is committed to building a better living environment for all people.  

Product
Development    

Growth
Strategy of the Company    

Our
mission is to maximize stockholder value through expanding the scope of products offered. We intend to conduct research and development
to bring new, improved products to market to ensure we are competitive in our market space. We intend to focus on growing our
distribution channels using master-distributor relationships, full-line distributors and other similar sales channels. We intend
to build product and brand awareness through a direct retail channel using online marketing and info-commercials, which we believe
will provide a feedback benefit for the growth of our other distribution channels as well as to establish opportunities for indirect
retail sales channels, such as through chain stores and small retailers.  

We
have been working to set up regional distributors in several different market segments, such as septic systems, grease traps,
ponds, agricultural and wastewater. Sales this fiscal year have primarily been to Mexico, and we are currently finalizing more
orders locally in New Jersey. All sales were completed in US dollars and have not been subject to any foreign taxes.  

During
the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2016, we commenced developing additional eco-based products in order to expand our product line.
During the quarter ended November 30, 2015, we successfully test marketed a liquid version of our Tank-Eze bioremediation product
( Liquid Tank-Eze ). Liquid Tank-Eze is different than the regular Tank-Eze in that it does not have the oxygen feature
and is designed to be primarily used in the treatment of drain lines prior to, or in conjunction with, Tank-Eze. As part of its
test marketing, we sold the Liquid Tank-Eze product in a four ounce (4 oz.) concentrated size through our online channels. We
intend to increase our marketing of Liquid Tank-Eze with a wider and more official launch in the near future. We also intend to
sell a line of eco-friendly certified green cleaning solutions, including but not limited to, a multi-surface cleaner and a glass
cleaner.  

Critical
Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments    

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments,
our commitments to strategic alliance partners and the timing of the achievement of collaboration milestones. We base our estimates
and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially
different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Besides the estimates identified
above that are considered critical, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related
disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience
and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances
change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical.  

Results
of Operations    

Three
Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2015    

The
following table presents Eco-Logical s results of operations for the periods indicated and as a percentage of total revenue.
Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.  

* Amounts
may not sum due to rounding.  

The
following tables present our revenue and operating expenses for the periods indicated.  

Revenue    

Our
Revenue increased 3.52% for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015. The
increase is attributed to more repeat sales from existing customers.  

Costs
and Expenses    

Costs
of Sales   

Our
Costs of Sales decreased 26.72% for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015.
The decrease is due to a decrease in sales volume through E-commerce which carries additional shipping and merchant fees.  

Operating
Expenses   

Our Operating Expenses decreased 15.45% for
the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease is the result of a
decrease in Management Fees as well as several less significant decreases in administrative costs. 

Interest
Expense   

Our
Interest Expense increased 637.03% for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended August 31,
2015. The increase is attributable to the sale of additional promissory notes to finance operations, some of which included debt
discounts which are amortized to interest expense each period.  

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources    

At
August 31, 2016, we had $9,435 in cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of $1,202,134; and had $3,472 in revenues for the three-month
period ended August 31, 2016. In their report for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, our auditors have expressed that there is
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred operating losses since our formation and
expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. We expect to incur substantial losses for
the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital
expenditures for the next several years and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future.
We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures.
As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able
to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively
impact the value of our Common Stock.  

To
date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of Convertible Promissory Notes to Joel Falitz and other non-affiliated
third parties and the issuance and sale of equity securities for cash consideration. During the quarter ended August 31, 2016,
we have financed our operations by the following:  

Auctus
    Fund, LLC  . On July 25, 2016, the Company closed on the issuance of a Convertible Promissory Note, dated July 19, 2016
    (the  Issue Date ), in the original principal amount of $56,750 (the  Auctus Note ) to Auctus Fund,
    LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Auctus ), pursuant to which Auctus funded $50,000 to the Company after
    the deduction of $6,750 of diligence and legal fees. The Company sold the Auctus Note to Auctus pursuant to a Securities Purchase
    Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2016, between the Company and Auctus.   

The
Auctus Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum and matures on April 19, 2017. Any amount of principal or interest on
the Auctus Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-four percent (24%) per annum from the due
date thereof until the same is paid. The Company has the right to prepay the Auctus Note with a premium of up to 150% of all amounts
owed to Auctus, depending upon when the prepayment is effectuated. The Auctus Note may not be prepaid after the 180th day after
the Issue Date.  

All
principal and accrued interest on the Auctus Note is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the election
of Auctus at any time at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price of the common
stock during the 25 trading days prior to the Auctus Note being issued and (ii) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price of
the common stock during the 25 trading day period prior to conversion ( Conversion Price ).  

If
the Company fails to maintain its status as  DTC Eligible  for any reason, or, if the Conversion Price is less than
$0.001, the principal amount of the Auctus Note shall increase by $15,000 and the Conversion Price shall be redefined to mean
forty percent (40%).  

The
Auctus Note contains default events which, if triggered and not timely cured, will result in default interest and penalties. The
Auctus Notes provides for  piggyback  registration rights for shares issuable upon the conversion of the Auctus Note.  

ADAR
    Bays, LLC  . On July 21, 2016, the Company closed a Securities Purchase Agreement ( ADAR SPA ) with ADAR
    Bays, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( ADAR ), providing for the purchase of two Convertible Redeemable
    Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $121,000 (the  ADAR Notes ), with the first note being in the amount
    of $60,500 ( ADAR First Note ) and the second note being in the amount of $60,500 ( ADAR Back End Note ),
    each with a 10% original issue discount ( OID ). ADAR First Note was funded, with the Company receiving $55,000,
    net of the 10% OID. With respect to ADAR Back End Note, also with a 10% OID, ADAR issued a note to the Company in the amount
    of $55,000 to offset ADAR Back End Note, secured by ADAR Back End Note ( Secured Note ). The funding of ADAR Back
    End Note is subject to certain conditions as described in ADAR Back End Note. As of October 27, 2016 the second Convertible
    Redeemable Note has not funded. ADAR is required to pay the principal amount of the Secured Note in cash and in full prior
    to executing any conversions under ADAR Back End Note.   

The
ADAR Notes may be converted by ADAR at any time into shares of Company s common stock calculated at the time of conversion,
except for ADAR Back End Note, which requires full payment of the Secured Note by ADAR before conversions may be made, at a conversion
price equal to 50% of the average of the three lowest trading prices of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations
Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded
in the future ( Exchange ), for the twenty (20) prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion
is received by the Company. In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion price
shall be decreased to 40% instead of 50% while that  Chill  is in effect. In no event shall the Holder be allowed
to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder
and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  

The
ADAR Notes bear an interest rate of 12%, and are due and payable on July 19, 2017. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common
Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares.
The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice. The Secured Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum is payable no later
than April 19, 2017, unless the Company does not meet the  current information requirements  required under Rule 144
of the Securities Act, in which case ADAR may declare the ADAR Back End Note to be in Default (as defined in that note) and cross
cancel its payment obligations under the Secured Note as well as the Company s payment obligations under ADAR Back End Note.  

During
the first six months the ADAR First Note is in effect, the Company may redeem the ADAR First Note by paying to an amount equal
to 140% of the face amount plus any accrued interest. The ADAR First Note may not be prepaid after the six-month anniversary.
The ADAR Back End Note may not be prepaid, except that if the ADAR First Note is redeemed by the Company within 6 months of the
issuance date of the ADAR First Note, all obligations of the Company under the ADAR Back End Note and all obligations of ADAR
under the Secured Note will be automatically be deemed satisfied and such notes will be automatically be deemed cancelled and
of no further force or effect.  

The
ADAR SPA and ADAR Notes contain certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default including if the Company
is delinquent in its periodic report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and increases in the amount of the principal
and interest rates under the Notes in the event of such defaults. In the event of default, at the option of ADAR and in ADAR s
sole discretion, ADAR may consider the Notes immediately due and payable.  

On
    August 25, 2016, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Agreement for $10,000 with a third party unaffiliated
    lender. The Note bears interest at 8% per annum, and the principal amount and any interest thereon are due one year following
    the borrowing date. Pursuant to the agreement, the Note is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price to
    be mutually finalized between the Company and the holder of the Convertible Promissory Note within 48 hours of the conversion
    request.   

On
    August 25, 2016, the Company borrowed $1,237 from the President of the Company, $1,000 of which was repaid on August 30, 2016.
    The loan is unsecured, non-recourse and non-interest bearing.   

On November
                                         1, 2016, the Company sold a Promissory Note to an unaffiliated lender for the aggregate
                                         principal amount of $12,500, bearing interest at a rate of 8% per annum and maturing
                                         the first year anniversary of the date of issuance. The Company may prepay the principal
                                         and accrued interest at any time without penalty. 

Working
Capital    

Since the Company s inception, we have
incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of August 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit
of $1,082,292, an accumulated deficit of $1,202,134 and a stockholders  deficit of $1,082,292. 

At
August 31, 2016, the Company was indebted to the President of the Company and a company controlled by the President of the Company
for $49,083. The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

We
do not believe our cash resources are sufficient to implement our current business plan, support operations and meet current obligations
for the next 12 months. We plan to raise additional capital to finance our operations. There can be no assurance that financing
will be available when required in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms or at all. In the event that the necessary additional
financing is not obtained, we may be required to reduce our discretionary overhead costs substantially, including research and
development, general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses or otherwise curtail operations.

       Services    

1.1  
      The
    Company hereby engages you, and you hereby accept such engagement, as the Company s Chief Operating Officer of the Company
    on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

1.2  
      You
    shall provide to the Company the management services set forth on   Schedule A   attached hereto (the   Services  ).   

1.3  
      To
    the extent you perform any Services on the Company s premises or using the Company s equipment, you shall comply
    with all applicable policies of the Company relating to business and office conduct, health and safety and use of the Company s
    facilities, supplies, information technology, equipment, networks and other resources.   

2.  
       Term    

The
term of this Agreement is set forth on   Schedule A  , unless earlier terminated in accordance with  Section 8 
(the   Term  ). Any extension of the Term will be subject to mutual written agreement between the parties.  

3.  
       Compensation
    (Fees and Expenses)    

3.1  
      As
    full compensation for the Services and the rights granted to the Company in this Agreement, the Company shall pay you a fixed
    fee set forth on   Schedule A   (the   Fees  ), payable as set forth on   Schedule A  ,
    and, as a restricted stock grant, issue to you the shares of the Company s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the

    A  .    

3.2  
      The

3.3  
      The
    Company shall have the right to withhold from any amount payable hereunder any Federal, state and local taxes in order for

      Upon
    earning the Restricted Shares in accordance with   Schedule A  , you and the Company shall enter into a Restricted

    where a credit card payment would be feasible and applicable.    

3.6  
      The
    Company shall pay all undisputed Fees   Expense within five (5) business days after the Company s receipt of an
    invoice submitted by you in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in   Schedule A  .

    the results and proceeds of the Services performed under this Agreement (collectively, the   Deliverables  ),
    including all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights (collectively, the   Intellectual
    Property Rights  ) therein. You agree that the Deliverables are hereby deemed a  work made for hire 
    as defined in 17 U.S.C.  101 for the Company. If, for any reason, any of the Deliverables do not constitute a  work
    made for hire,  you hereby irrevocably assign to the Company, in each case without additional consideration, all right,
    title and interest throughout the world in and to the Deliverables, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein.

      Any
    assignment of copyrights under this Agreement includes all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any
    other rights that may be known as  moral rights  (collectively, the   Moral Rights  ). You hereby
    irrevocably waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any and all claims you may now or hereafter have in any jurisdiction

    the nature or details of any such inventions or processes without the prior written consent of the Company.   

Ecosciences, Inc.  Management Services Agreement  Page  2    

4.4  
      Upon
    the request of the Company, you shall promptly take such further actions, including execution and delivery of all appropriate
    instruments of conveyance, as may be necessary to assist the Company to prosecute, register, perfect, record or enforce its
    rights in any Deliverables. In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to obtain your signature on any such
    documents, you hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company as your agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on
    your behalf solely to execute and file any such application or other document and do all other lawfully permitted acts to
    further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property protected related to the Deliverables
    with the same legal force and effect as if you had executed them. You agree that this power of attorney is coupled with an
    interest.   

4.5  
      Notwithstanding
     Section 4.1 , to the extent that any of your pre-existing materials are contained in the Deliverables, you retain ownership
    of such pre-existing materials and hereby grant to the Company an irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited, royalty-free license
    to use, publish, reproduce, display, distribute copies of, and prepare derivative works based upon such pre-existing materials
    and derivative works thereof. The Company may assign, transfer and sublicense such rights to others without your approval.   

4.6  
      Except
    for such pre-existing materials, you have no right or license to use, publish, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon,
    distribute, perform, or display any Deliverables. You have no right or license to use the Company s trademarks, service
    marks, trade names, trade names, logos, symbols or brand names.   

5.  
       Confidentiality    

5.1  
      You
    acknowledge that you will have access to information that is treated as confidential and proprietary by the Company, including,
    without limitation, trade secrets, technology, and information pertaining to business operations and strategies, customers,
    pricing, marketing, finances, sourcing, personnel operations of the Company, its affiliates or their suppliers or customers,
    in each case whether spoken, written, printed, electronic or in any other form or medium (collectively, the   Confidential
    Information  ). Any Confidential Information that you develop in connection with the Services, including but not
    limited to any Deliverables, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this  Section 5 . You agree to treat all
    Confidential Information as strictly confidential, not to disclose Confidential Information or permit it to be disclosed,
    in whole or part, to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company in each instance, and not to use any
    Confidential Information for any purpose except as required in the performance of the Services. You shall notify the Company
    immediately in the event you become aware of any loss or disclosure of any Confidential Information.   

5.2  
      Confidential
    Information shall not include information that:   

(a)  
      is
    or becomes generally available to the public other than through your breach of this Agreement; or   

(b)  
      is
    communicated to you by a third party that had no confidentiality obligations with respect to such information.   

Ecosciences, Inc.  Management Services Agreement  Page  3    

5.3  
      Nothing
    herein shall be construed to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information as may be required by applicable law or regulation,
    or pursuant to the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency, provided that the
    disclosure does not exceed the extent of disclosure required by such law, regulation or order. You agree to provide written
    notice of any such order to an authorized officer of the Company within 24 hours of receiving such order, but in any event
    sufficiently in advance of making any disclosure to permit the Company to contest the order or seek confidentiality protections,
    as determined in the Company s sole discretion.

    Warranties and Covenants

refers to the purchased Restricted Shares and all securities received in replacement of or in connection with the Restricted Shares
pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in replacement of the Restricted Shares in a recapitalization,

with the execution of this Agreement by the parties or on such other date as the Company and Purchaser shall agree (the   Purchase
Date  ). The parties have agreed that the Services rendered by Purchaser on or prior to the date hereof (the   Past

requirements is available. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Restricted Shares
for resale. Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned
on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Restricted Shares,
and requirements relating to the Company which are outside of the Purchaser s control, and which the Company is under no
obligation and may not be able to satisfy.  

(d) Purchaser
understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser s purchase or disposition of the
Restricted Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection

and Restated Management Services Agreement, dated November 2, 2016 (the   Services Agreement  ) between the Purchaser
and the Company, and, in consideration for the Services in connection with the signing bonus set forth on   Schedule A  
to the Services Agreement (the   Signing Bonus  ), the Company desires to issue and sell the Restricted Shares
(as defined in  Section 1  below) to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase the Restricted Shares from the
Company; and  

NOW
THEREFORE , the Company and Purchaser agree as follows:  

1.  Sale
of Restricted Shares .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Purchase Date (as defined below) the
Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company,    31,200,000    unregistered
shares of the Company s Common Stock (the   Restricted Shares  ) at a purchase price of $31,200 (the  Signing
Bonus ) or $0.001 per Share. The term   Restricted Shares   refers to the purchased Restricted Shares and
all securities received in replacement of or in connection with the Restricted Shares pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all
securities received in replacement of the Restricted Shares in a recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like,
and all new, substituted or additional securities or other properties to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser s
ownership of the Restricted Shares.  

2.  Purchase .
 The purchase and sale of the Shares under this Agreement shall occur at the principal office of the Company simultaneously
with the execution of this Agreement by the parties or on such other date as the Company and Purchaser shall agree (the   Purchase
Date  ). The parties have agreed that the Services rendered by Purchaser on or prior to the date hereof (the   Past
Services  ) have a value equal to the aggregate purchase price of the Shares. On the Purchase Date, the Company will
issue shares as book entry and at the earliest practicable date deliver to Purchaser a certificate representing the Shares to

for investment for its own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any  distribution 
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.  

(b) Purchaser
understands that the Restricted Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom,
which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser s investment intent as expressed herein.  

(c) Purchaser
understands that the Restricted Shares are  restricted securities  under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
laws and that, pursuant to these laws, Purchaser must hold the Restricted Shares indefinitely unless they are registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification
requirements is available. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Restricted Shares
for resale. Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned
on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Restricted Shares,
and requirements relating to the Company which are outside of the Purchaser s control, and which the Company is under no
obligation and may not be able to satisfy.  

(d) Purchaser
understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser s purchase or disposition of the
Restricted Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection
with the purchase or disposition of the Restricted Shares and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.

those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control
over financial reporting.
