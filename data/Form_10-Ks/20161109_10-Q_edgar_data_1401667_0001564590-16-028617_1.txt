    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   
 Note 1 Business and Basis of Presentation:  
 Business:  
 Puma Biotechnology, Inc., or Puma, is a biopharmaceutical company based in Los Angeles, California with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. The Company in-licenses the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates PB272 (neratinib (oral)), PB272 (neratinib (intravenous)) and PB357. Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. Currently, the Company is primarily focused on the development of the oral version of neratinib, and its most advanced drug candidates are directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The Company believes that neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2. 
 In November 2012, the Company established and incorporated Puma Biotechnology Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, for the sole purpose of serving as Puma s legal representative in the United Kingdom and the European Union in connection with Puma s clinical trial activity in those countries.  
 Basis of Presentation:  
 The Company is initially focused on developing neratinib for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2, or HER2-positive, breast cancer, HER2 mutated non-small cell lung cancer, HER2-negative breast cancer that has a HER2 mutation and other solid tumors that have an activating mutation in HER2.  The Company has reported a net loss of approximately $65.8 million and $203.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and negative cash flows from operations of approximately $100.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Management believes that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities through the drug development process.  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for interim financial information.  Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation.  Interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or for any subsequent period.  These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The Company has spent and expects to continue to spend substantial amounts in connection with implementing its business strategy, including planned product development efforts, clinical trials and preparation for commercialization.  The Company s continued operations will depend on its ability to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financing. Through September 30, 2016, the Company s financing was primarily through public offerings of Company common stock and private equity placements. Given the current and desired pace of clinical development of its product candidates and efforts to prepare for commercialization, management believes that the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at September 30, 2016, together with the approximately $161.8 million in net proceeds the Company received from the issuance and sale of its common stock in October 2016, are sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next 12 to 18 months. The Company may need additional financing until it can achieve profitability, if ever.  There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms or at all or that any additional capital that the Company is able to obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs.  If it is unable to raise additional capital, the Company could likely be forced to curtail desired development activities, which will delay the development of its product candidates.

Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies:   
 The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements are as follows:  
 Use of Estimates:  
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet, and reported amounts of expenses for the period presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include accrued expenses for the cost of services provided by consultants who manage clinical trials and conduct research and clinical trials on behalf of the Company that are billed on a delayed basis. As the actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its estimated cost in that period. The value of stock-based compensation includes estimates based on future events, which are difficult to predict. It is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimates used to record accrued expenses and to value the stock-based compensation will occur in the near term.  
 Principles of Consolidation:  
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents:  
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.  
 Investment Securities:  
 The Company classifies all investment securities (short term and long term) as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management s strategies. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method. Interest income is recognized when earned.  
 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:  
 Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 820,  Fair Value Measurement , or ASC 820, provides a single definition of fair value and a common framework for measuring fair value as well as new disclosure requirements for fair value measurements used in financial statements. Under ASC 820, fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received by a company to sell an asset or paid by a company to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, exclusive of any transaction costs. Fair value measurements are determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. The principal market is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability. Absent a principal market to measure fair value, the Company uses the most advantageous market, which is the market from which the Company would receive the highest selling price for the asset or pay the lowest price to settle the liability, after considering transaction costs. However, when using the most advantageous market, transaction costs are only considered to determine which market is the most advantageous and these costs are then excluded when applying a fair value measurement. ASC 820 creates a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values. The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.  

Level 1:  

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2:  

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.  

Level 3:  

Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.  

7 

Following are the major categories of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets   (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):  

The Company s investments in commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities are exposed to price fluctuations. The fair value measurements for commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities are based upon the quoted prices of similar items in active markets multiplied by the number of securities owned, exclusive of any transaction costs and without any adjustments to reflect discounts that may be applied to selling a large block of securities at one time.  
 Concentration of Risk:  
 Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company s cash and cash equivalents in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insured limits at September 30, 2016, were approximately $56.8  million. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk due to the quality of the financial instruments in which the money is held. Pursuant to the Company s internal investment policy, investments must be rated A-1/P-1 or better by Standard and Poor s Corporation and Moody s Investors Service at the time of purchase.  
 Property and Equipment:  
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred.  
 The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When such events occur, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the asset s carrying value with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows of the asset. Should impairment exist, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. The Company has not recognized any impairment losses through September 30, 2016.  
 Research and Development Expenses:  
 Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. The major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs, clinical trial expenses, consulting and other third-party costs, salaries and employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, supplies and materials, and allocations of various overhead costs. Clinical trial expenses include, but are not limited to, investigator fees, site costs, comparator drug costs, and clinical research organization, or CRO, costs. In the normal course of business, the Company contracts with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of potential products. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variations from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. The Company s accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites, cooperative groups and CROs. The objective of the Company s accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in the condensed consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accruals in that period.  
 8 

In instances where the Company enters into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities, upfront amounts are recorded to prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying condensed consolidat  ed balance sheets and expensed as services are performed or as the underlying goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the services to be rendered or goods to be delivered, any remaining capitalized amounts for non-refundable upfront payments ar  e charged to expense immediately. Amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service, and may include upfront payments, monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables.   
 Costs related to the acquisition of technology rights and patents for which development work is still in process are charged to operations as incurred and considered a component of research and development costs.  
 Stock-Based Compensation:  
 Stock option awards: 
 ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , or ASC 718, requires the fair value of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period. Under ASC 718, employee option grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method. As allowed by ASC 718 for companies with a short period of publicly traded stock history, the Company s estimate of expected volatility is based on the average expected volatilities of a sampling of seven companies with similar attributes to the Company, including industry, stage of life cycle, size and financial leverage. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation. Option forfeitures are calculated when the option is granted to reduce the option expense to be recognized over the life of the award and updated upon receipt of further information as to the amount of options expected to be forfeited. The option expense is  trued-up  upon the actual forfeiture of a stock option grant. Due to its limited history, the Company uses the simplified method to determine the expected life of the option grants.  
 Performance shares: 
 The  performance  shares are valued on the grant date and the fair value of the performance award is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The performance share expense is recognized based on the Company s estimate of a range of probabilities that the Company s closing common stock price on the vesting dates will be lower or higher than the Company s common stock price on the grant date. Based on the range of probabilities, the expense is calculated and recognized over the three-year vesting period. 
 Restricted stock units: 
 The  restricted stock units, or RSUs,  are valued on the grant date and the fair value of the RSUs is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The RSU expense is recognized over the requisite service period.  When the requisite service period begins prior to the grant date (because the service inception date occurs prior to the grant date), the Company is required to begin recognizing compensation cost before there is a measurement date (i.e., the grant date). The service inception date is the beginning of the requisite service period. If the service inception date precedes the grant date, accrual of compensation cost for periods before the grant date shall be based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. In the period in which the grant date occurs, cumulative compensation cost shall be adjusted to reflect the cumulative effect of measuring compensation cost based on fair value at the grant date rather than the fair value previously used at the service inception date (or any subsequent reporting date). 
 Net Loss per Common Share:  
 Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented as required by ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Diluted earnings per common share are the same as basic earnings per common share because the assumed exercise of the Company s outstanding options are anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculations were 5,730,151 shares issuable upon exercise of options, 9,469 shares issuable as performance awards, 2,116,250 shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant, and 640,644 shares underlying restricted stock units that are subject to vesting. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, potentially dilutive securities excluded from the earnings per common share calculation were 4,444,258 issuable upon exercise of options, 18,942 issuable as performance shares and 2,116,250 shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant.  
 Deferred Rent:  
   The Company has entered into operating lease agreements for its corporate offices in Los Angeles and South San Francisco that contain provisions for future rent increases, leasehold improvement allowances and rent abatements. The Company records monthly rent expense equal to the total of the payments due over the lease term, divided by the number of months of the lease term. The difference between the rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is reflected as a  
 9 

separate line item in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company rec  orded as deferred rent the cost of the leasehold improvements paid by the landlord, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.   
 Issuance of Common Stock Upon Exercise of Stock Option Grants:  
 When a stock option grant is exercised, the Company notifies its transfer agent to release the required number of shares of common stock from the reserve for the Company s 2011 Incentive Award Plan, as amended, or the 2011 Plan. The Company records the transaction for the cash received and the issuance of common shares. Should there be a delay in the cash receipts due to the settlement period, the Company records a receivable from the exercise of an option as part of stockholders  equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards: 
 In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The amendments in ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of some of the amendments included in ASU 2016-01 for financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on its financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The amendments in ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets, with lease terms of more than 12 months, to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU No. 2016-02 will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging  (Topic 815):  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments . ASU 2016-06 amends FASB ASC 815-15 to clarify what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments in ASU No. 2016-06 on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have on its financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (Topic 718). ASU 2016-09 will require organizations to recognize all income tax effects of awards in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled. ASU 2016-09 will also allow organizations to repurchase more shares from employees than they could previously purchase for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its financial statements. 
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606). ASU 2016-10 amends ASC 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to clarify two aspects of ASC 606, identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles of those areas. The amendments in ASU 2016-10 do not change the core principle of the guidance in ASC 606. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-10 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in ASU No. 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASC 606 and any other Topic amended by ASU 2014-09. ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606):  Deferral of the Effective Date , defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-10 will have on its financial statements. 
   In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606). ASU 2016-12 amends ASC 606 to address certain issues in the guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the  
 10 

guidance in ASC 606. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-12 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)  ,     which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for   the amendments in ASU No. 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASC 606 and any other Topic amended by ASU 2014-09. ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606):   Deferral of the Effective Date  , defers   the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-12 w  ill have on its financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230) : Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force), which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3 Prepaid Expenses and Other:  
 Prepaid expenses and other consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Note 4 Property and Equipment:  
 Property and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company disposed of leasehold improvements that were surrendered as a result of the amended lease in its South San Francisco location (see Note 9   Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).  The loss on the disposal of leasehold improvements was approximately $0.4 million. 
   
 11 

Note 5 Accrued Expenses:   
 Accrued expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Accrued CRO services represent the Company s estimate of such costs and will be adjusted in the period the actual costs become known. Accrued compensation includes estimated bonus and earned but unused vacation for full-time employees. When actual performance bonuses are paid out to employees, the bonus expense will be adjusted to reflect the actual expense for the year. Additionally, vacation is accrued at the rate the employee earns vacation and reduced as vacation is used by the employee. 
   
 Note 6 Stockholders  Equity:  
   
 Stock-Based Compensation:  
 The Company s 2011 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on September 15, 2011.  Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, as well as other forms of equity-based compensation. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees, while consultants, employees, officers and directors are eligible for the grant of nonqualified options  under  the 2011 Plan. The maximum term of stock options granted under the 2011 Plan is 10 years. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 2011 Plan must be at least equal to the fair value of such shares on the date of grant. Through September 30, 2016, a total of 10,529,412 shares of the Company s common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2011 Plan. 
 Employee stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):  

Performance Shares:  
   During January 2014, performance share awards that provide for a maximum of 28,411 shares of common stock to be issued were granted to certain employees. These shares vest over three years on the first, second and third anniversary of December 15, 2013. On each vesting date, if the Company s closing common stock price is equal to $102.46 per share, one-third of the 28,411 shares will be awarded. If the Company s closing common stock price on a vesting date is either lesser or greater than $102.46 per share, the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be adjusted to be less than one-third of the 28,411 shares. No shares will be awarded on a vesting date if the Company s closing common stock price is less than $47.53 per share at such vesting dates. The  
 12 

performance shares are valued on the grant date and the fair value of the performance award is equal   to the market price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The performance share expense is recognized based on the Company s estimate of a range of probabilities that the Company s closing common stock price will be lower or higher than $102.46   on the vesting dates. Based on the range of probabilities, the expense is calculated and recognized over the three-year vesting period.  On December 15, 2015, the second vesting occurred and the calculations were performed.  As a result, 6,530 shares of co  mmon stock were issued to the employees and 2,943 performance shares were cancelled.  The third and final vesting event will occur on December 15, 2016.  

Stock Options:  
 The fair value of options granted to employees was estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method (see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies) with the following weighted-average assumptions used during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Activity with respect to options granted under the 2011 Plan is summarized as follows:  

At September 30, 2016, total estimated unrecognized employee compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and performance shares granted prior to that date were approximately $138.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. These unrecognized expenses are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years for stock options and 0.3 years for performance shares. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $26.79 per share and $89.17 per share, respectively.  

13 

Restricted stock units: 
 On October 14, 2016, restricted stock units were awarded to certain employees.  These restricted stock units vest over three years in six equal installments on each six month anniversary of the vesting start date, July 19, 2016.  Because the service period began on the vesting start date of July 19, 2016, and the award date did not occur until October 14, 2016, the restricted stock units are valued using the fair value on September 30, 2016, and will be adjusted to the fair value on the award date, October 14, 2016. 

1     As the service inception date preceded the grant date, the Company s accrual of compensation cost for the periods before the grant date was based on the fair value of the awards at the reporting date.     
   
 Note 7 401(k) Savings Plan:  
 During 2012, the Company adopted a 401(k) savings plan for the benefit of its employees. The Company is required to make matching contributions to the 401(k) plan equal to 100% of the first 3% of wages deferred by each participating employee and 50% on the next 2% of wages deferred by each participating employee. The Company incurred expenses for employer matching contributions of approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Note 8 Receivables:  
 On April 1, 2016, the Company took possession of additional office space pursuant to the amendments to the leases entered into in July 2015 (see Note 9   Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).  This office space increased the leased square footage in the Los Angeles and South San Francisco offices by approximately 26,000 square feet and 13,000 square feet, respectively.  Pursuant to the terms of these amended leases, the landlords provided tenant improvement allowances.  One of the tenant improvement allowances was prepaid by the Company and will be reimbursed by the landlord prior to December 31, 2016.  The total of this landlord receivable is approximately $1.2 million. 
   
 Note 9 Subsequent Events: 
 On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement in connection with the public offering, issuance and sale by the Company of 3,750,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a public offering price of $40.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.  Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, the Company also granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 562,500 shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 20, 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares in full. 
 The Company received net  proceeds  from the offering of approximately $161.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for the overall development of its drug candidates, including, but not limited to, research and development and clinical trial expenditures, pre-commercialization activities and general corporate and working capital purposes.

Item 2.   
 
          MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS      

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Unless otherwise provided in this Quarterly Report, references to the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Puma Biotechnology Ltd.  
 Overview  
 We are a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. We in-license the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates PB272 (neratinib (oral)), PB272 (neratinib (intravenous)) and PB357.  Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4.   Currently, we are primarily focused on the development of the oral version of neratinib, and our most advanced drug candidates are directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.  We believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2.  Our efforts and resources to date have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies, raising capital and recruiting personnel. We have had no product sales to date and we will have no product sales until we receive approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling a drug product. Developing drug products, however, is a lengthy and very expensive process. Assuming we do not encounter any unforeseen safety issues during the course of developing our drug candidates, we do not expect to receive approval of a product candidate until approximately 2017. 
 We recently completed a Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, which we refer to as the ExteNET trial.  Based on the results from the ExteNET trial, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the FDA for regulatory approval of neratinib in the extended adjuvant setting in the United States in July 2016 and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in June 2016.  We are continuing to evaluate potential commercialization options for neratinib in this indication, including developing a direct sales force, contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities, some combination of these two options or other strategic options.   We expect that our expenses will continue to increase as we continue to evaluate our options with regard to commercialization efforts. 
 Critical Accounting Policies  
 As of the date of the filing of this quarterly report, we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from our accounting policies at December 31, 2015, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Summary of Expenses  
 General and administrative, or G A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, professional fees, business insurance, rent, general legal activities, preparation for commercialization and other corporate expenses. 
 Research and development, or R D, expenses include costs associated with services provided by consultants who conduct clinical services on our behalf, contract organizations for manufacturing of clinical materials and clinical trials. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our R D expenses consisted primarily of clinical research organization, or CRO fees, fees paid to consultants, salaries and related personnel costs and stock-based compensation. We expense our R D costs as they are incurred.

Results of Operations   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 General and administrative expenses:  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, G A expenses were approximately $14.0 million, compared to approximately $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, G A expenses increased approximately $5.2 million compared to the same period in 2015.  Approximately $3.0 million of this increase is related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense attributable to our increased headcount and additional incentive awards to existing employees.  The remaining approximately $2.2 million increase in G A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily attributable to: 

an approximately $0.6 million increase in payroll and related costs as administrative headcount increased from 16 to 23 to support corporate growth and to prepare for the commercial launch of neratinib.  We expect these payroll and related costs to continue to increase as we prepare for commercialization.     

an approximately $0.8 million increase in professional fees and expenses, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, consulting and investor relations fees.  We expect these fees to increase as we continue to defend against the class action, derivative and defamation lawsuits filed against us, prepare for commercialization and as we support compliance measures related to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Sarbanes Oxley.     

an approximately $0.7 million increase in facility and equipment costs.  During 2015, we amended two of our office leases and in April 2016 we took possession of additional office space pursuant to the amended leases; therefore, we expect that our facility and equipment costs will continue at the higher levels similar to the three months ended September 30, 2016.     

 Research and development expenses:  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, R D expenses were approximately $52.0 million, compared to approximately $51.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

16 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, R D expenses increased approximately $0.1 million compared to the same period in 2015.  Stock-based compensation expense increased approximately $1.8 million and reflects our increased headcount and additional awards to existing employees, offset by an approximately $1.7 million decrease in other R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016.The decrease in other R D expenses was primarily attributable to: 

an approximately $2.7 million decrease in clinical trial expenses as a result of a decrease in CRO professional and pass-through costs of approximately $3.7 million and a decrease in drug supply manufacturing and logistics of approximately $0.8 million as clinical trial activity decreased, offset by an approximately $1.8 million increase in clinical services primarily attributable to our preparation for filing the NDA and MAA, which were submitted in July 2016 and June 2016, respectively.       

an approximately $0.7 million increase for internal clinical development, internal regulatory affairs and quality assurance, and internal chemical manufacturing.  This increase represents an increase in full-time R D headcount to 135 from 126 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.     

an approximately $0.1 million increase in consultants and contractors related expenses due to increased activity in our preparation for filing the NDA and MAA, which were submitted in July 2016 and June 2016, respectively.     

We expect R D expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to decrease slightly going forward for our existing clinical trials as we conclude the work performed by CRO and consulting expenses related to the filing and review of the NDA and MAA. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 General and administrative expenses:  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, G A expenses were approximately $37.3 million, compared to approximately $22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. G A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, G A expenses increased approximately $15.1 million compared to the same period in 2015.  Approximately $7.5 million of this increase is related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense attributable to our increased headcount and additional incentive awards to existing employees.  The remaining approximately $7.6 million increase in G A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily attributable to: 

an approximately $1.9 million increase in payroll and related costs as administrative headcount increased from 16 to 23 to support corporate growth and to prepare for the commercial launch of neratinib.  We expect these payroll and related costs to continue to increase as we prepare for commercialization.     

an approximately $3.7 million increase in professional fees and expenses, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, consulting and investor relations fees.  We expect these fees to increase as we continue to defend against the class action, derivative and defamation lawsuits filed against us, prepare for commercialization and as we support compliance measures related to Sarbanes Oxley.     

an approximately $1.6 million increase in facility and equipment costs.  During 2015, we amended two of our office leases and in April 2016 we took possession of additional office space pursuant to the amended leases; therefore, we expect that our facility and equipment costs will continue at the higher levels similar to the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     

 17 

Research and development expenses:   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, R D expenses were approximately $166.4 million, compared to approximately $156.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, R D expenses increased approximately $10.4 million compared to the same period in 2015.  Approximately $7.2 million of this increase is related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, attributable to additional incentive awards to new and existing employees.  The remaining approximately $3.2 million increase in R D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily attributable to: 

an approximately $3.7 million increase for internal clinical development, internal regulatory affairs and quality assurance, and internal chemical manufacturing.  This increase represents an increase in full-time R D headcount to 135 from 126 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  We expect internal R D expenses to continue at levels similar to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as we expect headcount will remain at approximately the same level.     

an approximately $2.7 million increase in consultants and contractors related expenses due to increased activity in our preparation for filing the NDA and MAA, which were submitted in July 2016 and June 2016, respectively.       

an approximately $3.3 million decrease in clinical trial expenses as a result of a decrease in CRO professional and pass-through costs of approximately $9.9 million, offset by an increase in drug supply manufacturing and logistics of approximately $3.0 million and an increase of approximately $3.6 million in clinical services primarily attributable to our preparation for filing the NDA and MAA.     

 While expenditures on current and future clinical development programs, particularly our PB272 program, are expected to be substantial, they are subject to many uncertainties, including the results of clinical trials and whether we develop any of our drug candidates with a partner or independently. As a result of such uncertainties, we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety of other factors, including:  

the number of trials and studies in a clinical program;      

the number of patients who participate in the trials;      

the number of sites included in the trials;      

the rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;      

the duration of patient treatment and follow-up;      

the costs of manufacturing our drug candidates; and      

the costs, requirements, timing of, and ability to secure regulatory approvals.      

 Interest income:  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 , we recognized approximately $0.2 million and approximately $0.8 million in interest income, compared to approximately $0.3 million and approximately $0.7 million for the same periods in 2015, respectively. The increase in interest income is due to the use of longer-term higher yielding investments.   
 18 

Other expenses:  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss of approximately $0.4 million on the disposal of leasehold improvements due to the relocation of our South San Francisco office (see Note 9   Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 The following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and is intended to supplement the more detailed discussion that follows:  

Operating Activities: 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of approximately $65.8 million and $203.4 million, respectively, compared to approximately $60.4 million and $177.6 million for the same periods in 2015, respectively.  Additionally, cash used in operating activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $34.9  million and $100.7 million, respectively, compared to approximately $36.9 million and approximately $121.4 million for the same periods in 2015, respectively.   
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of a net loss of $203.4 million offset by approximately $91.9 million of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, a build-out allowance from the landlord for our office space, the disposal of leasehold improvements and stock-based compensation; an increase of approximately $5.2 million in accrued expenses and accounts payable; an increase of approximately $3.9 million in the liability for deferred rent; an increase in other receivables of approximately $1.2 million related to the build-out allowance to be received from the landlord; and a decrease of approximately $2.8 million in prepaid expenses and other. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $177.6 million offset by approximately $74.0 million of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, an increase in the liability for deferred rent of approximately $0.2 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other of approximately $0.7 and a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of approximately $19.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Investing Activities:  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $121.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately $125.5 million for the same period in 2015. The approximately $121.4 million of net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was made up of approximately $209.9 million of sales or maturities of available-for-sale securities, offset by $81.8 million of cash invested in available-for-sale securities, approximately $3.7 million used to purchase property and equipment and approximately $3.0 million of expenditures for leasehold improvements.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was primarily made up of approximately $211.8 million used for the purchase of available-for-sale securities, approximately $3.1 million used for restricted cash to secure a standby letter of credit for our amended leases and approximately $1.1 million used to purchase property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, offset by approximately $90.5 million cash provided by the sale or maturities of available-for-sale securities. 
 19 

Financing Activities:   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities consisted of approximately $0.4 million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  During the same period in 2015, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $232.0 million, comprised of net proceeds of approximately $205.1 million from the closing of the January 2015 public offering of our common stock and approximately $26.9 million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Current and Future Financing Needs:  
   
 We have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials and R D efforts, and our preparation for commercialization. Given the current and desired pace of clinical development of our product candidates, over the next 12 months we estimate that our R D spending will be approximately $115 million to $130 million, excluding stock-based compensation. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $20 million over the next 12 months for general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.  For sales and marketing, which includes costs to prepare for commercialization, we anticipate spending approximately $8 million to $10 million in the next 12 months.  However, should we receive regulatory approval, we anticipate a major increase in costs associated with sales and marketing and Licensor milestone payments. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, including the mechanism by which we choose to commercialize and some factors which are beyond our control.  
 While we believe that the approximately $108.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2016, together with the approximately $161.8 million in net proceeds we received from the issuance and sale of common stock in October 2016, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next 12 to 18 months, we may seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities, if necessary, especially in conjunction with opportunistic acquisitions or licensing arrangements. We expect to continue incurring significant losses for the foreseeable future and our continuing operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or by entering into a strategic alliance with a third party concerning one or more of our product candidates. Through September 30, 2016, a significant portion of our financing has been through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities. We will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described. We can give no assurances that any additional capital raised will be sufficient to meet our needs. Further, in light of current economic conditions, including the lack of access to the capital markets being experienced by small companies, particularly in our industry, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds in the future, we may be forced to delay or discontinue the development of one or more of our product candidates and forego attractive business opportunities. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the sale of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.  
 In addition, we have based our estimate of funding our capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner than planned or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of equity or debt and other sources of funds. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. In such an event, we would be required to undertake a thorough review of our programs, and the opportunities presented by such programs, and allocate our resources in the manner most prudent.  
 Contractual Obligations: 
 On April 1, 2016, we took possession of the additional office space pursuant to the amendments to the leases entered into in July 2015 (see Note 9   Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).  This office space increased the leased square footage in the Los Angeles and South San Francisco offices by approximately 26,000 square feet and 13,000 square feet, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
   In addition to our operating results, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our operational performance. The following table presents our net loss and net loss per share, calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to remove the impact of employee stock-based compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures. We believe these non-GAAP  
 20 

measures enhance understanding of our financial performance, are more indicativ  e of our operational performance and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, stock-based compensation represented approximately 45.2% and 43.3% of our loss from operations, respectively, and approximately 41.3% and 41.3% for the same periods in 2015. This cost is related to our employee hiring practice and the fair market value of stock option grants on the day granted.  

Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Loss and 
 GAAP Net Loss Per Share to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Loss Per Share  
 (in thousands except share and per share data)  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any  off-balance sheet agreements,  as defined by SEC regulations.  

Item 3.   
 
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

 The primary objective of our investing activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing the risk of loss. Some of the investable securities permitted under our cash management policy may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates. To mitigate this risk, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments in a variety of securities, which may include investment grade commercial paper, money market funds, government debt issued by the United States of America, state debt, certificates of deposit and investment grade corporate debt. Presently, we are exposed to minimal market risks associated with interest rate changes because of the relatively short maturities of our investments and we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments. We manage our sensitivity to these risks by maintaining investment grade short-term investments. We do not purchase or hold derivative or commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. Additionally, we periodically monitor our investments for adverse material holdings related to the underlying financial solvency of the issuer. As of September 30, 2016, our investments consisted primarily of corporate obligations. Our results of operations and financial condition would not be significantly impacted by either a 10% increase or 10% decrease in interest rates, due mainly to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Additionally, we do not invest in foreign currencies or other foreign investments.

Item  4.   
 
        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the Company s principal executive officer) and Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration and Treasurer (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration and Treasurer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration and Treasurer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.   
 
   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

 Hsu v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al. 
 On June 3, 2015, Hsingching Hsu, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action lawsuit against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 8:15-cv-00865-AG-JCG).  On October 16, 2015, lead Plaintiff Norfolk Pension Fund filed an amended complaint on behalf of all persons who purchased our securities between July 22, 2014 and May 29, 2015.  The amended complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers made false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operations, prospects and performance in violation of Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks damages, interest, costs, attorneys' fees, and other unspecified equitable relief.  On November 30, 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiff opposed this motion, and the court heard oral argument on March 14, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss.  We intend to vigorously defend this matter. 
 Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al. 
 On February 2, 2016, Fredric N. Eshelman filed a lawsuit against our Chief Executive Officer and President, Alan H. Auerbach, and us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (Case No. 7:16-cv-00018-D).  The complaint generally alleges that Mr. Auerbach and we made defamatory statements regarding Dr. Eshelman in connection with a proxy contest.  Dr. Eshelman seeks compensatory and punitive damages and expenses and costs, including attorneys  fees.  On April 4, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  On May 2, 2016, Dr. Eshelman filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the claims against Mr. Auerbach.  The court has set a schedule for discovery to be conducted through September 2017.  We intend to vigorously defend this matter. 
 Derivative Actions 
 On April 12 and April 14, 2016, alleged shareholders filed two derivative lawsuits purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of our officers and directors in the Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles, captioned Xing Xie v. Alan H. Auerbach, et al., No. BC616617, and Kevin McKenney v. Auerbach, et al., No. BC617059. The complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, mismanagement and waste of corporate assets arising from substantially similar allegations as those contained in the putative securities class action described above. The complaints seek an unspecified sum of damages and equitable relief.  We intend to vigorously defend these matters. 
 The pending proceedings described in this section involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to defend. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible. 

Item  1A  .   
 
   RISK FACTORS     

 Under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016, we identified important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q. There has been no material change in our risk factors subsequent to the filing of our Annual Report. However, the risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we currently deem to be immaterial or not currently known to us, as well as other risks reported from time to time in our reports to the SEC, also could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. 

Item  2.   
 
   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS     

 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities  
 We did not sell any of our equity securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers  
 Neither we nor any  affiliated purchasers  within the definition of Rule 10b-18(a)(3) made any purchases of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
