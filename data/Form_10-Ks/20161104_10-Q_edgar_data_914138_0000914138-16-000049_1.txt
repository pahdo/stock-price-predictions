MIDDLEBURG FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1.        General 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of operations and comprehensive income, for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30,   2015  , in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").  The statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ) of Middleburg Financial Corporation (the  Company ).  The results of operations for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  On October 24, 2016, the Company and Access National Corporation ( Access ) announced a definitive agreement to combine in a strategic merger (the  Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Access (the  Merger ).  As a result of the Merger, the holders of shares of the Company's common stock will receive   1.3314   shares of Access common stock for each share of the Company's common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.   
    
  In preparing these financial statements, management has evaluated all other subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date these financial statements were issued.  Management has concluded there were no additional material subsequent events to be disclosed. 
    
  Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.   No reclassifications were significant and there was no effect on net income. 

Note 2.        Share-Based Compensation Plan 
    
  The Company sponsors   one   share-based compensation plan, the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, which provided for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance share awards, incentive awards, and stock units.  The 2006 Equity Compensation Plan was approved by the Company s shareholders at the Annual Meeting held on April 26, 2006, and succeeded the Company s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan.  The plan expired by its own terms in February 2016, before which, the Company granted share-based compensation to its directors, officers, employees, and other persons the Company determined to have contributed to the profits or growth of the Company.  The number of shares reserved for issuance totaled   430,000  .   
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded   $240,000   and   $162,000  , respectively, in share-based compensation.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded   $685,000   and   $443,000  , respectively, in share-based compensation expense.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $1.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted awards under the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded   no   compensation expense related to option awards.  As of   September 30, 2016   all outstanding option awards were previously vested and, accordingly, there was   no   unrecognized compensation expense as of   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value, noted in the option table below, represents the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price as of   September 30, 2016  .  Given there is no exercise price for restricted stock, the aggregate value is equal to the current market value of the stock.  These amounts change based on changes in the market value of the Company s common stock.  

8 

The following table summarizes restricted stock awarded under the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan: 

The weighted-average remaining contractual term for non-vested restricted stock awards at   September 30, 2016  , was   2.50   years.   
    
  The following table summarizes options outstanding under the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan and remaining outstanding unexercised options under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan.   

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was   $27,000   and   $88,000   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  There were   no   options exercised for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , options outstanding and exercisable are summarized as follows: 

Note 3.        Securities 
    
  Amortized costs and fair values of securities held to maturity are summarized as follows.  

9 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities held to maturity as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity are shown below.  

Amortized costs and fair values of securities available for sale are summarized as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity are shown below.  Maturities may differ from contractual maturities in corporate and mortgage-backed securities because the securities and mortgages underlying the securities may be called or repaid without any penalties.  Therefore, these securities are not included in the maturity categories in the following maturity summary. 
  
    10 

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $43.9 million   and   $11.60 million  , respectively.  Proceeds from calls and principal repayments of securities available for sale during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and 2015 were   $58.7 million   and   $70.7 million  , respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gross gains of   $534,000   and   $175,000   and gross losses of   $23,000   and   $37,000  , respectively, were realized.  The tax expense applicable to these net realized gains amounted to   $174,000   and   $47,000   for the nine months ended September 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  The carrying value of securities pledged to qualify for fiduciary powers, to secure public monies and for other purposes as required by law amounted to   $120.0 million   and   $113.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Investments in an unrealized loss position that are temporarily impaired are as follows: 

11 

A total of   141   securities have been identified by the Company as temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  Of the   141   securities,   136   are investment grade and   five   are speculative grade.  Mortgage-backed securities, other asset backed securities and corporate securities make up the majority of the gross unrealized losses for temporarily impaired securities at   September 30, 2016  .  Market prices change daily and are affected by conditions beyond the control of the Company.  Although the Company has the ability to hold these securities until the temporary loss is recovered, decisions by management may necessitate a sale before the loss is fully recovered.    No   such sales were anticipated or required as of   September 30, 2016  .  Investment decisions reflect the strategic asset/liability objectives of the Company.  The investment portfolio is analyzed frequently by the Company and managed to provide an overall positive impact to the Company s consolidated income statement and balance sheet. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company evaluated the investment portfolio for possible other-than-temporary impairment losses and concluded that no adverse change in cash flows occurred.  Based on this analysis and because the Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell any securities before recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity, the Company does not consider any portfolio securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  For debt securities related to corporate securities, the Company determined that there was no other adverse change in the cash flows as viewed by a market participant; therefore, the Company does not consider the investments in these assets to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  However, there is a risk that the Company s continuing reviews could result in recognition of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the future.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   no   credit related impairment losses were recognized by the Company. 
    
  Restricted securities 
  The Company s investment in FHLB stock totaled   $3.9 million   and   $4.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  FHLB stock is generally viewed as a long-term investment and as a restricted security which is carried at cost because there is no market for the stock other than the FHLB or member institutions.  Therefore, when evaluating FHLB stock for impairment, its value is based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value.  The Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  , and   no   impairment has been recognized.  FHLB stock is shown in restricted securities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Company also has an investment in Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) stock which totaled   $1.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The investment in FRB stock is a required investment and is carried at cost since there is no ready market. The Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  , and   no   impairment has been recognized.  FRB stock is shown in restricted securities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 4.        Loans, Net 
    
  The Company segregates its loan portfolio into   three   primary loan segments:  Real Estate Loans, Commercial Loans, and Consumer Loans.  Real estate loans are further segregated into the following classes: construction loans, loans secured by farmland, loans  
  
    12 

secured by 1-4 family residential real estate, and other real estate loans.  Other real estate loans include commercial real estate loans.  The consolidated loan portfolio was composed of the following: 

(1)   
    Includes net deferred loan costs and premiums of   $3.7 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively. 
       
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received   $4.4 million   in proceeds from the sale of problem loans.  Included in the sales were   four   loans with a recorded investment of   $4.3 million  , of which   $1.2 million   were on nonaccrual, as well as   28   loans with no outstanding recorded investment as they had been fully charged-off in prior periods.  Gross charge-offs of   $513,000   and gross recoveries of   $640,000   were recorded through the allowance for loan losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to the sales of these loans.  
    
  The following tables present a contractual aging of the recorded investment in past due loans by class of loans: 

13 

The following table presents the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans and loans that were past due   90   days or more and still accruing : 

If interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued, such income would have approximated   $370,000   and   $342,000   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of measuring and monitoring credit risk in the loan portfolio.  Under the Company s classification system, problem and potential problem loans are classified as  Special Mention ,  Substandard , and  Doubtful . 
    
  Special Mention:  Loans with potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.  If left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. 
    
  Substandard:  Loans with well-defined weakness that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  Either the paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral may be inadequate to protect the Company from potential losses. 
    
  Doubtful:  Loans with a very high possibility of loss.  However, because of important and reasonably specific pending factors, classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined. 
    
  Loss:  Loans are deemed uncollectible and are charged off immediately. 
    
  The following tables present the recorded investment in loans by class of loan that have been classified according to the internal classification system: 

14 

The following tables present loans individually evaluated for impairment by class of loan: 

The  Recorded Investment  amounts in the table above represent the outstanding principal balance net of charge-offs and nonaccrual payments to principal on each loan represented in the table.  The  Unpaid Principal Balance  represents the outstanding principal balance on each loan represented in the table plus any amounts that have been charged-off on each loan and nonaccrual payments applied to principal. 
    
  Included in certain loan categories of impaired loans are troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).  The total balance of TDRs at   September 30, 2016   was   $14.4 million   of which   $2.0 million   were included in the Company s nonaccrual loan totals at that date  
  
    15 

and   $12.4 million   represented loans performing as agreed according to the restructured terms. This compares with   $15.5 million   in total restructured loans at   December 31, 2015  .  The amount of the valuation allowance related to TDRs was   $1.1 million   and   $1.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Loan modifications that were classified as TDRs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

There were   no   outstanding commitments to lend additional amounts to troubled debt restructured borrowers at   September 30, 2016   or December 31, 2015. 
    
  There were   no   TDR payment defaults during   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  For purposes of this disclosure, a TDR payment default occurs when, within   12 months   of the original TDR modification, either a full or partial charge-off occurs or a TDR becomes   90 days   or more past due. 

Note 5.        Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The following table presents, the total allowance for loan losses, the allowance by impairment methodology (individually evaluated for impairment or collectively evaluated for impairment), the total loans and loans by impairment methodology (individually evaluated for impairment or collectively evaluated for impairment).

Note 6.        Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following shows the weighted-average number of shares used in computing earnings per share and the effect on weighted-average number of shares of diluted potential common stock.  Nonvested restricted shares are included in basic earnings per share because of dividend participation rights.  Potential dilutive common stock had no effect on income available to common stockholders. 

The warrant and   none   of the stock options were considered anti-dilutive as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  
    18 

Note 7.        Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company operates its principal business activities of retail banking services and wealth management services in a decentralized fashion.  Revenue from retail banking activity consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans, including mortgage banking activity, interest earned on investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts.  Revenue from the wealth management activities is comprised of fees based upon the market value of the accounts under administration as well as commissions on investment transactions.  
    
  Middleburg Bank and the Company have assets in custody with Middleburg Trust Company and accordingly pay Middleburg Trust Company a monthly fee. Middleburg Bank also pays interest to Middleburg Trust Company on deposit accounts with Middleburg Bank.  Middleburg Trust Company pays rental and other miscellaneous occupancy expenses to Middleburg Bank.  Transactions related to these relationships are eliminated to reach consolidated totals. 
    
  The following tables represent reportable segment information for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively:

Note 8.        Capital Purchase Program  
    
  On   January 30, 2009  , as part of the Capital Purchase Program established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the  Treasury ) under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement Standard Terms (collectively, the  Purchase Agreement ) with the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company sold (i)   22,000   shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value   $2.50   per share, having a liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share (the  Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant (the  Warrant ) to purchase   208,202   shares of the Company s common stock, par value   $2.50   per share, at an initial exercise price of   $15.85   per share.  As a result of the completion of a public stock offering in 2009, the number of shares of common stock underlying the Warrant was reduced by   one-half   to   104,101  .  The Company subsequently redeemed all   22,000   shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  During 2011, the Warrant was sold by the U.S. Treasury at public auction and, on November 3, 2016, the warrant was exercised in full for a total cash consideration of   $1.65 million  .  

Note 9.        Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. U.S. GAAP requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Based on the underlying inputs, each fair value measurement in its entirety is reported in one of the three levels.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
    
           Level I. 
    Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 
       
           Level II. 
    Pricing inputs are other than the quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.  The nature of these assets and liabilities includes items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently and items that are fair-valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 
       
           Level III. 
    Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date.  These items do not have two-way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 

20 

Measured on a recurring basis 
    
  The following describes the valuation techniques and inputs used by the Company in determining the fair value of certain assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements.  
    
  Securities Available for Sale 
  The Company primarily values its investment portfolio using Level II fair value measurements, but may also use Level I or Level III measurements if required by the composition of the portfolio.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level II). In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified as Level III of the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps and Interest Rate Cap 
  Interest rate swaps and caps are recorded at fair value based on third party vendors who compile prices from various sources and may determine fair value of identical or similar instruments by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level II). 
    
  The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Measured on nonrecurring basis 
    
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure and recognize certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following describes the valuation techniques and inputs used by the Company in determining the fair value of certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements. 

21 

Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale are carried at lower of cost or market value.  These loans currently consist of 1-4 family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market.  Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level II).  As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis.  No nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Gains and losses on the sale of loans are recorded as a component of non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Impaired Loans 
  Loans are designated as impaired when, in the judgment of management based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected when due.  The measurement of loss associated with impaired loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral.  Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.  Any given loan may have multiple types of collateral.  The vast majority of the collateral is real estate.  The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level II).  However, if the collateral value is significantly adjusted due to differences in the comparable properties, or is discounted by the Company because of marketability, then the fair value is considered Level III.  The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business' financial statements if not considered significant.  Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivable collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level III).  Impaired loans allocated to the allowance for loan losses are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for loan losses on the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned 
  Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO ) is measured at fair value less estimated costs to sell, based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company.  If the collateral value is significantly adjusted due to differences in the comparable properties, or is discounted by the Company because of marketability, then the fair value is considered Level III.  The initial fair value of OREO is based on an appraisal performed at the time of foreclosure.  Subsequent fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and included in other real estate owned, net, on the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  For the purpose of OREO valuations, appraisals are discounted   10%   for selling costs and it is the policy of the Company to obtain annual appraisals for properties held in accordance with the bank's OREO policy.  
    
  Repossessed Assets 
  The value of repossessed assets is determined by the Company based on marketability and other factors and is considered Level III.  Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and are included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income.  
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s non-financial assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the period.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation.  Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices.  However, in many instances, there are   no   quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.  U.S. GAAP excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments (not previously described) for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Securities held to maturity 
  Certain debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are recorded at amortized cost.  Fair values are determined in a manner that is consistent with securities available for sale. 
    
  Restricted securities 
  The restricted security category is comprised of FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock.  These stocks are classified as restricted securities because their ownership is restricted to certain types of entities and they lack a market.  When the FHLB or Federal  
  
    23 

Reserve Bank repurchases stock, they repurchase at the stock's book value.  Therefore, the carrying amounts of restricted securities approximate fair value. 
    
  Loans, Net  
  For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.  For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market inputs at which loans with similar terms and qualities would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.  Where quoted market prices were available, primarily for certain residential mortgage loans, such market rates were utilized as estimates for fair value.  Fair value for impaired loans is described above. 
    
  Bank Owned Life Insurance 
  The carrying amount of bank owned life insurance is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable 
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values. 
    
  Deposits 
  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  For all other deposits, the fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method.  The discount rate is equal to the rate currently offered on similar products. 
    
  Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
  The carrying amounts approximate fair values. 
    
  FHLB Borrowings and Subordinated Notes 
  For variable rate long-term debt, fair values are based on carrying values.  For fixed rate debt, fair values are estimated based on observable market prices and discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates for borrowings of similar remaining maturities and characteristics.  The fair values of the Company's Subordinated Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
  The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.  The fair value of standby letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of loan commitments and standby letters of credit were deemed immaterial; therefore, they have not been included in the tables below. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the Company's financial instruments are as follows: 
  
    24 

The Company assumes interest rate risk as a result of its normal operations.  The fair values of the Company's financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, which may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company.  Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk.  However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment.  Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment.  Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company's overall interest rate risk. 

Note 10.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   This update is intended to provide guidance  
  
    25 

about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.  Management is required under the new guidance to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued when preparing financial statements for each interim and annual reporting period.  If conditions or events are identified, the ASU specifies the process that must be followed by management and also clarifies the timing and content of going concern footnote disclosures in order to reduce diversity in practice.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments in ASU 2016-01, among other things: 1) Requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 2) Requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 3) Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables). 4) Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  Among other things, in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) A lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.  The amendments in this ASU clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria remain intact. The amendments are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-05 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required.  In addition, the amendments in this ASU require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  
    26 

During March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The amendments in this ASU, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for SEC filers for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If retrospective application is impractical for some of the issues addressed by the update, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 12.        Derivatives 
    
  The Company utilizes derivative instruments as a part of its asset-liability management program to control fluctuation of market values and cash flows to changes in interest rates associated with certain financial instruments.  The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging".  Under current guidance, derivative transactions are classified as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges or they are not designated as hedging instruments.   The Company designates each derivative instrument at the inception of the derivative transaction in accordance with this guidance.  Information concerning each of the Company's categories of derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented below. 
    
  Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
    
  During 2010, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as part of the interest rate risk management process.  The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge intended to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with the Company s trust preferred capital securities.  The swap hedges the cash flow associated with the trust preferred capital notes wherein the Company receives a floating rate based on LIBOR from a counterparty and pays a fixed rate of   2.59%   to the same counterparty.  The swap is calculated on a notional amount of   $5.2 million  .  The term of the swap is   10   years and commenced on   October 23, 2010  .  The Company had cash collateral reserved for this swap in the amount of   $400,000   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The swap was entered into with a counterparty that met the Company s credit standards and the agreement contains collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party.  The Company believes that the credit risk inherent in the contract is not significant. 
    
  During 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as part of the interest rate risk management process.  The swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge intended to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with the Company s  
  
    28 

FHLB borrowings.  The swap hedges the cash flows associated with the FHLB borrowings wherein the Company receives a floating rate based on LIBOR from a counterparty and pays a fixed rate of   1.43%   to the same counterparty.  The swap is calculated on a notional amount of   $10.0 million  .  The term of the swap is   5   years and commenced on November 25, 2013.  The Company had cash collateral reserved for this swap in the amount of   $600,000   and   $300,000   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The swap was entered into with a counterparty that met the Company s credit standards and the agreement contains collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party.  The Company believes that the credit risk inherent in the contract is not significant. 
    
  Amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement, with the effective portion of the derivative s unrealized gain or loss recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss, if any, would be recorded in other expense.  The Company has assessed the effectiveness of the hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows on the designated hedged item.  As a result of this assessment, there was   no   hedge ineffectiveness identified for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  At   December 31, 2015   there was   no   hedge ineffectiveness identified for this interest rate swap.   
    
  The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized losses (fair value, net of tax) were   $293,000   and   $195,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Information concerning the derivatives designated as a cash flow hedges at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following tables: 

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
    
  Two-way client loan swaps 
  During the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2012, the Company entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which we enter into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each swap transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on an identical notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay the counterparty the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows our clients to effectively convert a variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for our customers, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivatives contracts offset each other and do not significantly impact our results of operations.  
    
  Certain additional risks arise from interest rate swap contracts in that the counterparties to the contracts may not be able to meet  the terms of the contracts. We do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.  
    
  Information concerning two-way client interest rate swaps not designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges is presented in the following table:

Rate Cap Transaction 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had   one   derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of   $10.0 million  .  The notional amount of the financial derivative instrument does not represent exposure to credit loss.  The Company is exposed to credit loss only to the extent the counter-party defaults in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the agreement.  The credit risk in derivative instruments is mitigated by entering into transactions with highly-rated counterparties that management believes to be creditworthy and by limiting the amount of exposure to each counter-party.  We do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.  
    
  The details of the interest rate cap agreement as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below: 
  
    30 

In the third quarter of 2015, the interest rate cap agreement was purchased to limit the Company's exposure to rising interest rates.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid a premium of   $70,000   for the right to receive cash flow payments if 3-month LIBOR rises above the cap of   2.00%  , thus effectively ensuring interest expense is capped at a maximum rate of   2.00%   for the duration of the agreement.  The interest rate cap agreement is a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument. 
    
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total fair value of the interest rate cap agreement was   $3,000   and   $39,000  , respectively.  The fair value of the interest rate cap agreement is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in other operating expenses.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015,   $36,000   and   $31,000   was recognized in other operating expenses.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the total fair value of the interest rate cap agreement was   $35,000   and   $35,000   was recognized in other operating expenses. 
    
  The premium paid on the interest rate cap agreement is recognized as a decrease in interest income over the duration of the agreement using the caplet method.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015,   no   premium amortization was required.  

Note 13.        Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) 
    
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, OREO balances were   $3.4 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively.  OREO is primarily comprised of residential properties and non-residential properties, and are located primarily in the state of Virginia. Changes in the balance for OREO, net of valuation allowances, are as follows:  

Expenses applicable to net OREO, including gains and losses on sales as well as valuation adjustments, were   $183,000   and   $193,000   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and   $339,000   and   $285,000   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  The major classifications of OREO in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 
  
    31 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had   no   consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate for which foreclosure was in process.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had   one   consumer mortgage loan secured by residential real estate that totaled   $533,000   for which foreclosure was in process and subsequently transfered to OREO. 

Note 14.        Low Income Housing Tax Credits 
    
  The Company has invested in   four   separate housing equity funds at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The general purpose of these funds is to encourage and assist participants in investing in low-income residential rental properties located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, develop and implement strategies to maintain projects as low-income housing, deliver Federal Low Income Housing Credits to investors, allocate tax losses and other possible tax benefits to investors, and to preserve and protect project assets.  The investments in these funds were recorded as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and were   $8.50 million   and   $9.03 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The expected terms of these investments and the related tax benefits run through 2033.  Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $110,000   and   $36,000  , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were   $345,000   and   $178,000  , respectively, related to these investments.  Total projected tax credits to be received for 2016 are   $504,000  , which is based on the most recent quarterly estimates received from the funds.  Additional capital calls expected for the funds totaled   $8.71 million   and   $9.31 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITON AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
       
  The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition at September 30, 2016 and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and in the 2015 Form 10-K. It should also be read in conjunction with the  Caution About Forward Looking Statements  section at the end of this discussion. 

Overview 
    
  The Company is headquartered in Middleburg, Virginia and conducts its primary operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, Middleburg Bank and Middleburg Investment Group, Inc.  Middleburg Bank is a community bank serving the Virginia counties of Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax, Fauquier, the City of Williamsburg and the City of Richmond with twelve financial service centers and one limited service facility.  Middleburg Investment Group is a non-bank holding company with one wholly owned subsidiary, Middleburg Trust Company.  Middleburg Trust Company is a trust company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and maintains offices in Williamsburg, Virginia and in several of Middleburg Bank s financial service centers.    
    
  The Company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by Middleburg Bank.  Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense.  Interest income depends on the amount of interest-earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon.  Middleburg Bank s cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon.  The quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on nonaccrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses or potential other-than-temporary impairment of securities.  Middleburg Investment Group s subsidiary, Middleburg Trust Company, generates fee income by providing investment management and trust services to its clients.  Investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets under management, and, therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets.   
    
  On October 24, 2016, the Company and Access National Corporation ( Access )  announced a definitive agreement to combine in a strategic merger (the  Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Access (the  Merger ).  As a result of the Merger, the holders of shares of the Company's common stock will receive 1.3314 shares of Access common stock for each share of the Company's common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger.  The completion of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including obtaining the approvals of the Company s and Access' shareholders and receiving certain regulatory approvals.  The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter 2017. 
    
  Net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   2.46%   to   $2.26 million   from   $2.32 million   for the same period in 2015. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.32   per share compared to   $0.32   per share for the same period in   2015  .  Net income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   1.09%   to   $6.97 million   from   $7.05 million   over the same period in 2015. Earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   $0.98   per share.  
    
  Annualized return on average assets for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.68%   compared to   0.73%   for the same period in   2015  .  Annualized return on average equity for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was   7.01%   compared to   7.32%   for the same period in   2015  .  Annualized return on average assets for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.71%  , compared to   0.75%   for the same period in 2015. Annualized return on average equity for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   7.37%  , compared to   7.54%   for the same period in 2015. 
    
  The net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure more fully described in the  Results of Operations  section below, decreased from   3.28%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   3.11%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  The net interest margin decreased from   3.31%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   3.20%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company recorded a recovery of loan losses in the amount of $297,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the recovery of loan losses of $432,000 for the same period in   2015  .  The provision for loan losses was   $53,000   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a recovery of loan losses of $407,000 for the same period in 2015.  Refer to the discussion of asset quality in the financial condition section for specific discussion in the movement of asset quality.  
    
  Non-interest income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   3.36%   compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Non-interest income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   6.08%   compared to the same period in 2015.  The Company recorded net gains on securities available for sale of   $138,000   and   $511,000   the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as sales were made to fund loan growth.  Also, in the first quarter of 2015, there  
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  

was a substantial recovery of expenses of approximately $500,000 related to a loan that had previously been charged-off.  Excluding this recovery, other operating income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 would have been relatively flat compared to 2015.  Other operating income generally includes revenue from prepayment penalties, safe deposit charges, wire fees and other miscellaneous adjustments.    
    
  Non-interest expense increased by   0.91%   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense increased by   0.82%   compared to the same period in 2015.  
    
  The Company s capital ratios remain well above regulatory minimum capital ratios as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Assumes fully phased-in Basel III regulatory capital rules.  The Common Equity Ratio, the Tier 1 Ratio and the Total Capital Ratio include a 2.50% Capital Conservation Buffer that must be maintained in order for the bank to remain well capitalized and to avoid restrictions on payments of dividends, bonuses, capital repurchases and restricted payments. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , total assets were   $1.34 billion  , an increase of   3.10%   since   December 31, 2015  .  Gross loans held-for-investment increased by   $40.21 million   to   $845.89 million  , an increase of   4.99%   since   December 31, 2015  .  Total deposits were   $1.09 billion  , an increase of   4.87%   since   December 31, 2015  .  Non-maturity deposits, including demand, NOW and savings  deposits increased by   $33.75 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   $829.97 million   at   September 30, 2016  .

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  General 
  The financial condition and results of operations presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and this section are, to some degree, dependent upon the accounting policies of the Company.  The selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments, estimates, and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. 
    
  Presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important ( Critical Accounting Policies ) to the portrayal and understanding of Middleburg Financial Corporation s financial condition and results of operations.  The Critical Accounting Policies require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.  In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending upon the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  Middleburg Bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Middleburg Bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance:  the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with U.S. GAAP; the accounting policies for loan charge-offs and recoveries; the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio; and the loan grading system. 
    
  Middleburg Bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by applicable accounting standards.  Loans evaluated individually for impairment include nonperforming loans, such as loans on nonaccrual, loans past due 90 days or more, troubled debt restructurings and other loans selected by management.  If a loan evaluated individually is determined not to be impaired, then the loan is assessed for impairment with a group of loans that have similar characteristics.  For loans determined to be impaired, the evaluations are based upon discounted cash flows, collateral valuations or observable market price.  If the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired, then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment, if any.   
    
  For loans without individual measures of impairment, Middleburg Bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by applicable accounting standards.  Loans are grouped by similar characteristics, including the type of loan, the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type.  A loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon  
  
    34 

     Table of Contents  

estimates of default rates for a given loan grade, the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan.  The resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans, including:  borrower and industry concentrations; levels and trends in delinquencies, charge-offs and recoveries; changes in underwriting standards and risk selection; level of experience, ability and depth of lending management; and national and local economic conditions. 
    
  The amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of unimpaired loans is added together for a total estimate of loans losses.  This estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and, if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance, an additional provision to the allowance would be made.  If the estimate of losses is less than the allowance, the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates.  If the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates, the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses.  Middleburg Bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used, and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is appropriately stated.  If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses, an additional provision for loan losses would be made, which may be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Goodwill  
  With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, "Intangible-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment", the Company is no longer required to perform a test for impairment unless, based on an assessment of qualitative factors related to goodwill, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the likelihood of impairment is more than 50%, the Company must perform a test for impairment and may be required to record impairment charges.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount is greater than zero and its fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; thus, the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis. Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is recognized.  
    
  Management estimates fair value utilizing multiple methodologies which include discounted cash flows, comparable companies, third-party sale and assets under management analysis. Determining the fair value requires management to make judgments and assumptions related to various items, including estimates of future operating results, allocations of indirect expenses, and discount rates.  Management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, the fair value could be different in the future if actual results or market conditions differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 
    
  The Company s forecasted cash flows assume a stable economic environment and consistent long-term growth in assets under management over the projected periods.  Additionally, expenses are assumed to be consistently correlated with projected asset and revenue growth over the time periods projected.  Although we believe the key assumptions underlying the financial forecasts to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond the control of the Company.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the forecasted results will be realized and variations from the forecast may be material.  If weak economic conditions continue or worsen for a prolonged period of time, or if the reporting unit loses key personnel, the fair value may be adversely affected which may result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.  Any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge, and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI) for Securities 
  Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a  
  
    35 

     Table of Contents  

recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.

  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income represents the principal source of earnings of the Company.  Net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets.  Changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. 
    
  Net interest income was   $9.62 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  This is a decrease of   0.43%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The net interest margin for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was   3.11%   compared to a net interest margin of   3.28%   for the same period in   2015  .  The net interest income was   $29.34 million   for the nine months ended September

     Table of Contents  

30, 2016.  This is an increase of   2.56%   over net interest income reported for the same period for 2015.  The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   3.20%   compared to   3.31%   for the same period for 2015.     
    
  The following factors contributed to the change in the net interest margin: 
             
    Yields on earning assets for the quarter decreased by 16 bp compared to the same period for 2015. Yields on earning assets for the nine month period decreased by 10 bp compared to the same period for 2015. 
                
    Yields on investment securities decreased by 37 bp compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and decreased by 8 bp compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The principal reason for the decline in yields was elevated refinancing activity and sales of securities during the quarter. 
                
    Yields on loans decreased by 17 bp compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and decreased by 21 bp compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Loan yields declined in large part due to payoffs and lower yields on new loans added to the balance sheet.  
                
    The cost of funds has remained relatively stable at 38 bp, compared to the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  
       
  The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets.  Because a portion of interest income earned is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio.  The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for each of the reported periods is 34%.  The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under U.S. GAAP, to net interest income is reflected in the table below.  

Based on our internal interest rate risk models and the assumption of a sustained low rate environment, the Company expects net interest income to trend upward slightly throughout the next 12 months as principal paydowns from the securities portfolio are redeployed into higher yielding loans.  It is anticipated that targeted growth in earning assets and liability repricing opportunities will help mitigate the impact to the Company s net interest margin.  The Asset/Liability Management Committee continues to focus on various strategies to maintain the net interest margin. 
    
  Non-Interest Income 
  Non-interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability.  Management recognizes this and continues to review and consider areas where non-interest income can be increased.  Non-interest income includes fees generated by the commercial and retail banking segment and the wealth management segment.  Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was higher by   3.36%   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was lower by   6.08%   compared to the same period for 2015. A more detailed discussion of non-interest income follows:

The following table depicts the changes in non-interest income: 

Non-Interest Expense 
  Non-interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, increased by   0.91%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Non-interest expense increased by   0.82%   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Principal reasons for the changes in non-interest expenses were the following:   
             
    Salaries and employee benefit expenses for the quarter decreased by   1.38%   when compared to the same period in 2015.  Salaries and employee benefit expenses decreased by   2.70%   for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The decreases in salaries and employee benefit expenses were primarily due to the Company's continued cost control initiatives.  
                
    Costs related to other real estate owned (OREO) decreased for the quarter by   $10,000   when compared to the same period in 2015.  Costs related to OREO increased   $54,000   for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The difference was due to an increase in valuation adjustments based on updated appraisals during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.     
                
    Computer operations expense for the quarter increased   $81,000   when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Computer operations expense increased by   $387,000   for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The primary reasons for the increase in expenses are related to the conversion to a new on-line banking platform.

The adjusted efficiency ratio is not a measurement under U.S. GAAP. The Company calculates its efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expense (adjusted for amortization of intangibles and other real estate expenses) by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non-interest income excluding gains and losses on the investment portfolio. The tax rate utilized in calculating tax equivalent amounts is 34%. The Company calculates and reviews this ratio as a means of evaluating operational efficiency.   
    
  The calculation of the adjusted efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

(1)   
    Computed by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. 
               (2)   
    Includes tax-equivalent interest adjustments on loans and securities as well as tax-equivalent non-interest income adjustments related to the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance. 
       
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes on earnings was   $720,000   resulting in an effective tax rate of   24.13%   for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to   $850,000  , or   26.81%   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Income taxes on earnings was   $2.19 million  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   23.93%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   $2.51 million  , or   26.23%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the decline in the effective tax rate was an increased benefit from low income housing tax credits.  For a further discussion of low income housing tax credits, see  Note 14. Low Income Housing Tax Credits".

  Total consolidated liabilities at   September 30, 2016   were   $1.21 billion  , an increase of   2.97%   from   December 31, 2015  .  Total deposits increased by   $50.71 million   from December 31, 2015 to   $1.09 billion   as of September 30, 2016.  Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased by   $21.50 million   to   $63.50 million  .   
    
  Shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $128.92 million  , compared to   $123.55 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Retained earnings at   September 30, 2016   were   $64.60 million   compared to   $60.39 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The book value of the Company s common stock at   September 30, 2016   was $18.15 per share versus $17.44 per share at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Loans 
  The following table summarizes total loans by category: 

Changes in the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 
             
    Real estate construction loans primarily consist of pre-sold 1-4 family residential loans along with some commercial construction loans.  This category represented   3.8%   of total loans, a decrease of approximately   $7.15 million   from   $39.67 million  .   
                 
    Loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate represented   39.3%   of total loans, an increase of   $52.31 million  .   
                
    Other real estate loans are typically non-farm, non-residential real estate loans which are, in most cases, owner-occupied commercial buildings.  Other real estate loans represented   29.7%   of total loans, a decrease of   $7.26 million  .    
                
    Commercial loans, which consist of secured and unsecured loans to small businesses, increased by   1.76%  . 
        
  Asset Quality 
  Total nonperforming assets continue to decline, totaling $23.77 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $25.51 million and $26.07 million as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  Nonperforming assets include: 
              
    the sale of loans with a recorded investment of approximately $1.36 million; 
                 
    the transfer of loans to OREO with a recorded investment of approximately $530,000.

     Table of Contents  

Total past due loans increased by $5.12 million since December 31, 2015.  The increase was largely the result of two previously identified problem loans.  These loans were on nonaccrual and considered to be impaired at December 31, 2015 however; they were not contractually past due until 2016.  Based on our updated impairment evaluations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, no additional reserves were required.   
    
  Total classified loans decreased from $49.63 million at December 31, 2015 to $39.96 million at September 30, 2016.  The primary reason for the decline was due to the overall improvement in asset quality, as well as the sale and payoff of various classified loans.    
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received   $4.41 million   in proceeds from the sale of problem loans.  Included in the sales were   four   loans with a recorded investment of   $4.29 million  , of which   $1.25 million   were on nonaccrual, as well as   28   loans with no outstanding recorded investment as they had been fully charged-off in prior periods.  Gross charge-offs of   $513,000   and gross recoveries of   $640,000   were recorded through the allowance for loan losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to the sales of these loans.  
    
  The table below summarizes nonperforming assets for the periods indicated. 

(1)   
    Amount reflects restructured loans that are not included in nonaccrual loans. 
               (2)   
    Included in other assets. 
       
  Included in nonperforming loans are troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).  The total balance of TDRs at   September 30, 2016   was   $14.40 million   of which   $2.01 million   were included in the Company s nonaccrual loan totals at that date and   $12.39 million   represented loans performing as agreed to the restructured terms. This compares with   $15.50 million   in total TDRs at   December 31, 2015  .  The amount of the valuation allowance related to TDRs was   $1.11 million   and   $1.60 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Company requires six timely consecutive monthly payments be made and future payments be reasonably assured, before a restructured loan that has been placed on nonaccrual can be returned to accrual status. The Company does not utilize formal modification programs or packages when loans are considered for restructuring.  Any loan restructuring is based on the borrower s circumstances and may include modifications to more than one of the terms and conditions of the loan. 
    
  The Company has not performed any commercial real estate or other type of loan workout whereby the existing loan would have been structured into multiple new loans. 
    
  Allowance For Loan Losses 
  For a discussion of the Company s accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, see  Critical Accounting Policies   Allowance for Loan Losses .

     Table of Contents  

The Company increased its allowance for loan and lease losses ("ALLL") slightly to   $11.20 million   or 1.32% of total loans at September 30, 2016 compared to   $11.05 million   or 1.37% of total loans at December 31, 2015.  The increase was largely due to loan growth which led to a higher dollar amount of general reserves at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  For the year-to-date 2016, recoveries of previously charged-off loans exceeded current year charge-offs by $101,000.  The Company recorded a recovery of loan losses of $297,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to a recovery of loan losses of $432,000 for the same period of 2015 dur to improvements in asset quality.  The provision for loan losses was $53,000 and a recovery of loan losses of $407,000 was recorded for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  General reserves declined as the Company experienced negative loan growth during the quarter, which resulted in the recovery of loan losses.     
    
  The following table depicts the transactions, in summary form, related to the allowance for loan losses.  

The allocation of the allowance (dollars in thousands) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were: 

The Company has allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed reasonably necessary to provide for the probable losses inherent within each loan category.  The allocation of the allowance should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior periods or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends.  Additionally, the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is available to absorb losses on the total portfolio. 
    
  Securities 
  The carrying value of the securities portfolio, excluding restricted stock, was   $363.35 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $378.78 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

Unrealized losses were   $2.19 million   and $3.03 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Unrealized gains were $7.11 million and $5.82 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company evaluated the investment portfolio for possible other-than-temporary impairment and concluded that no adverse change in cash flows occurred and did not consider any securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  
    
  Goodwill and Other Identified Intangibles 
  Goodwill and other identified intangibles decreased by $129,000 from year end 2015 to   $3.51 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease is attributable to amortization expense related to intangibles.  
    
  Deposits  
  Total deposits increased by   $50.71 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   $1.09 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , due to strong deposit inflows, specifically in time deposits and non-interest bearing business checking accounts during the period. 
    
  Time deposits increased by   $16.96 million   or   6.93%   from   December 31, 2015   to   $261.53 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Time deposits include $24.45 million and $17.95 million of brokered certificates of deposit and CDARS deposits, respectively.   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase ( Repo Accounts ) increased by   $4.67 million   from   $26.87 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $31.54 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The Repo Accounts include certain long-term commercial checking accounts with average balances that typically exceed $100,000.  All repurchase agreement transactions entered into by the Company are accounted for as collateralized financings and not as sales.  
    
  FHLB Borrowings  
  The Company had no overnight advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB ) outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  FHLB term advances were   $63.50 million   at   September 30, 2016  , lower by   $21.50 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  .   The majority of FHLB advances have a remaining maturity of less than one year and we expect to replace them with core deposits as the advances mature. 

Capital Resources and Dividends 
    
  Shareholders' equity was   $128.92 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $123.55 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  During the quarter and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company declared common stock dividends of $0.13 per share and $0.39 per share, respectively, compared to $0.13 per share and $0.33 per share for the same periods in   2015  .  The book value of common stock was $18.15 per share at   September 30, 2016   and $17.44 at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  On September 15, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.00 million of the Company s common stock, or approximately 8% of the Company s outstanding shares. The repurchase program was effective immediately and runs through December 31, 2017. This program replaces the previous repurchase program adopted in 1999, pursuant to which the Company had 24,084 shares remaining eligible for repurchase.  As of  September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased a total of 104,300 shares under the current plan, with a total cost of $1.91 million and for a weighted average price of $18.33, of this 26,800 shares were repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with a total cost of $490,100 and for a weighted average price of $18.29. 
    
  The Company's capital ratios were well above regulatory minimums as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 
        
  The Company's capital conservation buffer was 9.83% at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  The Company s Tier 1 capital and Total capital includes $5.0 million of trust preferred securities.  Under the changes to the regulatory capital framework that were approved on July 9, 2013 by the federal banking agencies (Basel III Final Rule), the Company's trust preferred securities will continue to be included in Tier 1 capital and Total capital until they mature, pursuant to a "grandfathering" provision that exempts Middleburg Financial Corporation's securities from the more stringent regulatory capital treatment contained in the Basel III Final Rule for trust preferred securities.  In addition to "grandfathering" certain previously outstanding trust preferred securities for community banks, the Basel III Final Rule introduces a new Common Equity Tier 1 capital measure, increases the applicable minimum regulatory capital levels and certain prompt corrective action capital levels, and establishes a capital conservation buffer and new risk weights for certain types of assets.  The implementation date of the Basel III capital rules was January 1, 2015 for all US banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules and the date for banking organizations to meet the fully phased in Basel III capital ratios is January 1, 2019.  The Company is not  
  
    45 

     Table of Contents  

subject to the advanced approaches capital rules.  An advanced approaches banking organization is one that has total assets of $250 billion or more or foreign asset exposure of $10 billion or more (or elects with approval from its primary federal regulator to use the advanced approaches methodology to calculate risk weights). 
    
  Furthermore, with the Basel III Final Rule, banks must maintain minimum capital ratios in accordance with the following guidelines:       

            (1)   
    Prompt Corrective Action     
               (2)   
    Assumes fully phased-in Basel III regulatory capital rules.  The Common Equity Ratio, the Tier 1 Ratio and the Total Capital Ratio include a 2.50% Capital Conservation Buffer that must be maintained in order for the bank to remain well capitalized and to avoid restrictions on payments of dividends, bonuses, capital repurchases and restricted payments.   
       
  A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments.  However, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero.  The Basel III rule also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. 
    
  The following table shows the restrictions for various ranges of the buffer: 

The eligible retained income of the Company is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the Company's quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already considered in net income. 

Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management.  Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, short-term investments, securities classified as available for sale and loans and securities maturing within one year.  As a result of the Company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors  requirements and meet its customers  credit needs. 
    
  The Company also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements.  Middleburg Bank maintains federal funds lines with large regional and money-center banking institutions.  These available lines total approximately $45.0 million, none of which had outstanding balances at   September 30, 2016  .  Middleburg Bank is also able to borrow from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.  At   September 30, 2016  , available borrowing capacity from this source was $42.75 million.  At   September 30, 2016  , Middleburg Bank had   $31.54 million   of outstanding borrowings pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions ( Repo Accounts ), with maturities of one day.  The Repo Accounts are long-term commercial checking accounts with average balances that typically exceed $100,000.   
    
  The Company has a secured line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta.  The credit available from this line depends on the total assets of the bank.  As of September 30, 2016, the remaining credit availability from this line was $304.07 million, while the amount of eligible collateral, in the form of qualifying real estate secured loans, was $224.32 million.  The bank would  
  
    46 

     Table of Contents  

have to post additional collateral, in the form of eligible securities, if it sought to borrow more than the amount of eligible lending collateral. The Company had $239.04 million of unencumbered securities as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , cash, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold, short-term investments and unencumbered securities available for sale were 24.47% of total liabilities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the off-balance sheet arrangements disclosed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  Although the Company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance or achievements of the Company will not differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.  The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk, though it should be noted that the assets under management by Middleburg Trust Company are affected by equity price risk.  The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Company s asset/liability management  
  
    47 

     Table of Contents  

process, which is governed by policies established by its Board of Directors that are reviewed and approved annually.  The Board of Directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset/liability management policies to the Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ) of Middleburg Bank.  In this capacity, ALCO develops guidelines and strategies that govern the Company s asset/liability management related activities, based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends. 
    
  Interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates.  As interest rates change, the interest income and expense streams associated with the Company s financial instruments also change, affecting net interest income, the primary component of the Company s earnings.  ALCO uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes.  While ALCO routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two-year horizon, it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk.   
    
  The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the Company s balance sheet.  The simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year.  This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth, given a 200 basis point (bp) upward shift and a 200 basis point downward shift in interest rates.  The following reflects the range of the Company s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s interest rate risk model indicated that for an immediate 200 basis points increase in interest rates, net interest income was expected  to increase by   7.40%   over a 12-month period.  For the same time period, the interest rate risk model indicated that, for an immediate 200 basis points decrease in interest rates, net interest income was expected to decrease by 12.5% over a 12-month period.  The results for the down rate scenarios are not very meaningful given the low level of overall interest rates. While these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model, management believes the balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive. 
    
  The Company s specific goal is to lower, where possible, the cost of its borrowed funds by replacing borrowings with lower cost core deposits. 
    
  The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent the Company's forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.  These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions, including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows.  While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. 
    
  Also, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact of interest rate change, caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor     early withdrawals and product preference changes, and other internal and external variables.  Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the ALCO might take in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.)  Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the  
  
    48 

     Table of Contents  

evaluation of it that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  There are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which the property of the Company is subject. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  Other than the additional items disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item IA of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Combining Access and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect. 
  The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on Access  ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Access and the Company and to combine the businesses of Access and the Company in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of the Company or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, Access must successfully combine the businesses of Access and the Company. If Access is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. 
    
  Access and the Company have operated, and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on Access  ability to successfully combine the businesses of Access and the Company. To realize these anticipated benefits, after the completion of the Merger, Access expects to integrate the Company s business into its own. The integration process in the Merger could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each party s ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that affect adversely either party s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Access  ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which the Company now operates, which could have an adverse effect on Access  financial results and the value of its common stock. If Access experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause Access and the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from the Company s or Access  banking subsidiaries, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse effect on Access  results of operations or financial condition after the Merger. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and on Access for an undetermined period after consummation of the Merger. 
    
  The Merger may distract management of the Company from its other responsibilities. 
  The Merger could cause the management of the Company to focus its time and energies on matters related to the Merger that otherwise would be directed to its business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of the Company s management, if significant, could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect the business and earnings of the Company before the Merger, or the business and earnings of Access after the Merger. 
    
  Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company. 
  Each of the Company s and Access s obligation to consummate the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions, and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all.  Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Company s business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Company s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving a change in recommendation by the Company's board of directors, the Company may be required to pay to Access a termination fee of $9.9 million. 
    
  In addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses and would have committed substantial time and resources by our management, without realizing the expected benefits of the  
  
    49 

     Table of Contents  

Merger. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger also may result in negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, vendors and employees. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  The Merger Agreement limits the ability of the Company to pursue alternatives to the Merger. 
  The Merger Agreement contains  no-shop  provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limit the ability of the Company to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company, subject to certain restrictions, consummates a similar transaction other than the Merger, the Company must pay to Access a termination fee of $9.9 million. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration, with respect to the Company, with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the Merger. 
    
  The Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. 
  Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees by the Company may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or the combined company following the Merger. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company or the combined company following the Merger, the Company s business, or the business of the combined company following the Merger, could be harmed. In addition, the Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to the closing of the Merger and from taking certain specified actions until the Merger occurs, and the merger agreement restricts us from taking other specified actions until the merger occurs without the consent of Access.  These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. 

ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  On September 15, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of the Company s common stock, or approximately 8% of the Company s outstanding shares. The repurchase program was effective immediately and runs through December 31, 2017. This program replaces the previous repurchase program adopted in 1999, pursuant to which the Company had 24,084 shares remaining eligible for repurchase.  
    
  There were no repurchases of the Company's common stock that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
