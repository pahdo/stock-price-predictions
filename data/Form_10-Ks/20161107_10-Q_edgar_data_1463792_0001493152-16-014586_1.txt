1.   
       Nature
    of Operations and Going Concern    

GOLD
TORRENT, INC. (the  Company ) was incorporated as a Nevada company on August 15, 2006. At the time of its inception,
the Company created, tested and developed mobile applications, games and tools designed to engage consumers in transacting business
via mobile devices. On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Spin-off Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a company
controlled by a former shareholder to sell all intellectual property and assets associated with the previous business of the Company,
pursuant to which the Company was released from certain liabilities amounting to $420,653.  

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, the Company entered into an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with
a third party (Note 10).  

The
Company has incurred losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $2,788,767 (March 31, 2016 - $2,040,757) as of September
30, 2016, with limited resources and limited source of operating cash flows. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s working
capital deficiency was $85,116 (March 31, 2016   $196,599).  

The
Company s continuance as a going concern is dependent on the success of the efforts of its directors and principal stockholders
in providing financial support in the short-term, raising additional capital through equity or debt financing either from its
own resources or from third parties, and achieving profitable operations. In the event that such resources are not secured, the
assets may not be realized or liabilities discharged at their carrying amounts, and the difference from the carrying amounts reported
in these unaudited interim financial statements could be material. There is no assurance that management s plan to seek
additional capital will be realized, and these factors cast substantial doubt upon the use of the going concern assumption.  

These
unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of the assets or the amounts and classifications of the liabilities that may result from the inability of the
Company to continue as a going concern.  

2.   
       Significant
    Accounting Policies    

(a)  
      Basis
    of presentation   

These
unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( US GAAP ). The Company s functional and reporting currency is the US dollar.  

These
unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) that, in the
opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the interim financial information. The results of operations for
the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the
entire fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited interim financial statements and notes included
herein have been prepared on a basis consistent with, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s audited financial
statements and notes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as filed in its Form 10-K.

2.   
       Significant
    Accounting Policies (continued)    

(b)  
      Use
    of estimates   

The
preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the
fair value of warrants attached to common shares issued, the fair value of shares issued for services, the fair value of stock
options granted, and the recoverability of income tax assets.  

While
management believes the estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and could impact future
results of operations and cash flows.  

(c)  
      Basic
    and diluted earnings (loss) per share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss)
per share assumes the exercise of common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and
warrants. However, the calculation of diluted loss per share excludes the effects of various conversions and exercise of options
and warrants that would be anti-dilutive.  

(d)
      
      Foreign
    currency translation   

Transactions
in currencies other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date
for monetary assets and liabilities, and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Expenses are translated
at the average rates for the period, except amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related assets. Resulting
translation gains or losses are reflected in net income/loss.  

(e)
      
      Financial
    instruments   

All
financial instruments are classified as one of the following: held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, held-for-trading, available-for-sale
or other financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities held-for-trading are measured at fair value with gains and losses
recognized in net income. Financial assets held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities are measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale instruments are measured at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in stockholders  equity.  

A
financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The Company prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  

(i)
    Level 1    
      Applies
    to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

(ii)
    Level 2    
      Applies
    to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or indirectly,
    such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions.

(iii)
    Level 3    
      Applies
    to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable market data.

2.   
       Significant
    Accounting Policies (continued)    

(e)
      
      Financial
    instruments (continued)   

Transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments that are classified as held-to-maturity,
loans and receivables or other financial liabilities are included in the initial carrying value of such instruments and amortized
using the effective interest method. Transaction costs classified as held-for-trading are expensed when incurred, while those
classified as available-for-sale are included in the initial carrying value.  

(f)  
      Income
    taxes   

The
Company uses the asset and liability approach in its method of accounting for income taxes that requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes the effect of uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than
not based on technical merits that the position could be sustained where the tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon settlement. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if based upon available evidence,
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

(g)
      
      Share-based
    payments   

The
Company records all share-based payments at fair value. Where equity instruments are granted to employees, they are recorded at
the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date. The grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss
over the vesting period, described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied.  

Where
equity instruments are granted to non-employees, they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received. When the
value of goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated, the fair value is measured
by use of a valuation model.  

At
each balance sheet date, the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected
to vest. On the exercise of stock options, common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts
previously recorded to contributed surplus. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value
of share-based payments.  

(h)
      
      Exploration
    and evaluation    

The
Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed
as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred. An impairment loss is recognized when
the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral property. Impairment losses,
if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral property over its estimated fair value.  

(i)
      
      Recent
    accounting guidance adopted   

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

3.
       
       Financial
    Instruments    

The
Company has designated its cash as held-for-trading; and accounts payable, accrued liabilities and stockholders  loans as
other financial liabilities.  

(a)
      
      Fair
    value   

The
fair values of the Company s cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and stockholders  loans approximate their
carrying values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  

(b)
      
      Credit
    risk   

Credit
risk is the risk of potential loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. The Company is not exposed to significant credit risk as of September 30, 2016.  

(c)
      
      Translation
    risk   

The
Company s functional currency is the US dollar. The Company translates transactions in foreign currencies into US currency
using rates on the date of the transactions. Translation risk is considered minimal, as the Company does not incur any significant
transactions in currencies other than US dollars.  

(d)
      
      Interest
    rate risk    

The
Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and liabilities.  

(e)
      
      Liquidity
    risk   

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in satisfying its financial obligations as they become due. The Company
manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations and anticipated investing and financing activities. At September
30, 2016, the Company had accounts payable of $128,734 (March 31, 2016 - $226,619), which are due within 30 days or less. At September
30, 2016, accrued liabilities consist of accrued accounting and legal fees of $10,000 (March 31, 2016 - $15,000), and accrued
executive compensation of $363,607 (March 31, 2016 - $264,750).  

4.
       
       Common
    Stock    

During
the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements for the issuance of 5,363,600 shares of common
stock at a purchase price of $0.25 per share for a total amount of $1,340,900 in cash.  

During
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements for the issuance of 2,040,000 shares of
common stock at a purchase price of $0.25 per share for a total amount of $510,000 in cash, and 900,000 shares of common stock
at a purchase price of $0.50 per share for a total amount of $450,000 in cash.  

5.
       
       Stock
    Options    

Stock
options have been granted in conjunction with an Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) for employees, directors and consultants,
whereby a maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be issued under the Plan are 20,000,000 common shares. The term of
the options is determined by the Board of Directors and cannot exceed 10 years. The exercise price of the stock options is determined
by Board of Directors, but shall not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options
granted under the Plan vest over varying periods at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the period ended September
30, 2016 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company did not grant any options to officers and directors of the Company.

       Segmented
    Information    

The
Company operates primarily in one business segment  the identification and development of mining projects. Substantially
all of its assets and operations are located in the United States.  

10.
       
       Exploration
    and Development    

On
July 28, 2014, the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent ( LOI ) with a third party to negotiate and
enter into a Joint Venture Agreement for the development of the gold property known as Lucky Shot, Alaska (formerly known as  Willow
Creek ). On November 5, 2014, the Company signed an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement for the Lucky
Shot project in Alaska. The Exploration and Option Agreement provides the Company with the right to earn up to a 70% interest
in a joint venture with Miranda USA Inc. ( Miranda ) by making certain expenditures over the next three years totaling
$10,000,000. The principal terms of the Exploration and Option Agreement initially provided that the Company could earn an initial
20% interest in the Lucky Shot gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before November 5, 2015 in costs
related to exploration and development of the project. On September 2, 2015, Miranda granted the Company a six-month extension
to the dates related to this earn-in. Therefore, the Company was able to earn an initial 20% interest in the Lucky Shot gold project
by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before May 5, 2016 in costs related to exploration and development of the
project. On May 25, 2016, the Company received formal notice from Miranda that the Company has acquired a permanent 20% interest
in the Lucky Shot project by virtue of meeting the initial earning required expenditures.  

On
January 15, 2015 and January 6, 2016, the Company paid $150,000 for a Lease Agreement between Miranda and a private company, and
the amount was included in prepaid expenses and expensed over 12 months. In addition, the Company is committed to paying $150,000
every year on January 15. The purpose of this lease is to afford Miranda the opportunity to enter onto and produce minerals from
certain patents and State of Alaska mining claims located in the State of Alaska. This lease is to be transferred by Miranda to
the joint venture upon the Company earning its initial 20% interest. The parties have agreed to postpone forming the joint venture
company until the project finance discussions have been advanced to a point where the security and other requirements of the project
investor can be determined.

Business
Overview   

Gold
Torrent, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Nevada as Celldonate Inc. on August 15, 2006. Historically we were
in the business of developing mobile monetization solutions and applications. On September 10, 2013, certain shareholders, including
the Company s current Chief Executive Officer and its President, acquired approximately 53% of the Company s issued
and outstanding common stock resulting in a change of control. In connection with the transaction, Daniel Kunz was appointed Executive
Chairman and Ryan Hart was appointed Chief Executive Officer and President. Thereafter the Company began to focus on acquiring
ownership in late-stage exploration to development stage gold mining projects and/or royalty or streaming interests in low capital
intensity, late-stage mining projects in North America. On January 16, 2014, the Company changed its name to  Gold Torrent,
Inc.  in order to better reflect the direction and business of the Company. On that date, the Company also amended its Articles
of Incorporation to (i) effectuate a reverse split of the Company s common stock on a 1 for 5 basis; and (ii) increase the
number of the Company s authorized capital stock to 220,000,000 of which 200,000,000 were classified as common stock and
20,000,000 were classified as  blank check  preferred stock. On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Spin-off
Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a company controlled by a former shareholder to sell all intellectual property and
assets associated with the previous business of the Company, pursuant to which the Company was released from certain liabilities
amounting to $420,653.  

Going
forward, the Company plans to focus on acquiring ownership in late-stage exploration to development-stage gold mining projects
and/or royalty or streaming interests in low capital intensity, late-stage mining projects in North America but may pursue other
profitable business opportunities that are available to us. Our main focus will be on identifying solid resources, and then utilize
funding to bring a distressed asset into production, while either securing equity ownership or rights of title in the form of
royalties. We are targeting pre-production resource projects that are well understood and show strong financial projections and
low capital intensity, where we can apply capital to take the projects into production within 12-36 months.  

On
November 5, 2014, the Company signed an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with Miranda U.S.A., Inc. ( Miranda )
for the Willow Creek project in Alaska (the  Exploration and Option Agreement ). The Exploration and Option Agreement
provides the Company with the right to earn up to 70% interest in a joint venture with Miranda Gold Corp. by making certain expenditures
over the next three years totaling US$10 million. The initial principal terms of the Exploration and Option Agreement provided
that the Company could earn an initial 20% interest in the Willow Creek gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of
$1,070,000 before November 5, 2015 in costs related to exploration and development of the project. On September 2, 2015 Miranda
granted the Company a six-month extension to the dates related to the earn-in. Therefore the Company could earn an initial 20%
interest in the Willow Creek gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before May 5, 2016 in costs related
to exploration and development of the project. While the Company shall be the manager of the initial joint venture, the management
committee during the initial earn in period shall be comprised of one nominee from the Company and one nominee from Miranda.  

Upon
completion of the initial work commitment, the Company can then either terminate the agreement or exercise an option to enter
into a limited liability company ( JV ) with Miranda under the following terms:  

Miranda
    will assign the underlying twenty-year lease that includes 8700 acres of patented mining claims and State Claims on the Lucky
    Shot project to the JV and Miranda will retain a 30% participating interest in the JV;   

The
    Company will solely fund the next US$8.93 million of expenditures on the JV to earn a 70% interest in the JV in two stages
    over the next two years while Miranda will hold the remaining 30%; and   

The
    Company shall be entitled to 90% of the cash flow from production at the Lucky Shot project until it recovers its US$10 million
    initial capital investment, and 80% of the cash flow from production thereafter until it recovers any of its initial investment
    that exceeds $10 million, and thereafter shall be entitled to 70% of project cash flows. Miranda shall be entitled to 10%,
    20% and 30%, respectively, of the Lucky Shot cash flow.   

The
Company plans to complete initial engineering, resource, permitting, and economic studies during the initial earn-in period with
a goal to bring the Lucky Shot project, beginning initially in the Coleman area gold resource area, into production as soon as
possible. Expansion and exploration drilling is planned during construction and during commercial production and is expected to
expand the initial known mineralization well beyond the current levels.  

On
January 15, 2015, and January 6, 2016 the Company paid $150,000 for a Lease Agreement between Miranda USA Inc. and a private company,
and the amount was included in prepaid expenses and expensed over 12 months. In addition, the Company is committed to paying $150,000
every year on January 15. The purpose of this lease is to afford Miranda USA Inc. the opportunity to enter onto and produce minerals
from certain patented and State of Alaska mining claims located in the State of Alaska. This lease is to be transferred by Miranda
to the joint venture upon the Company earning its initial 20% interest.  

On
May 25, 2016, the Company received formal notice from Miranda that the Company has acquired a permanent 20% interest in the Lucky
Shot project by virtue of meeting the initial earning required expenditures. The parties have agreed to postpone forming the joint
venture company until the project finance discussions have been advanced to a point where the security and other requirements
of the project investor can be determined.  

The
Company engaged third party consultants to complete a Preliminary Feasibility Study on its Lucky Shot Project. The Preliminary
Feasibility Study for the Lucky Shot Project was completed June 30, 2016. The study concludes,  The Project is projected
to have robust economics at the base case gold and silver prices of $1,175/oz and $15.00/oz respectively. The Project would be
economically viable based on the parameters considered in this study. The base case scenario produces approximately 79,100 salable
ounces of gold and 7,700 salable ounces of silver over a 4.5-year period. The Project is most sensitive to the gold price and
to operating costs, but not as sensitive to capital costs. The base case economic analysis of the Project shows an After-Tax NPV-10
of $5.28 million using a 200-tonne/day crushing/grinding/gravity separation plant. The total required initial and working capital
is $16.2 million and reaches pay-back in 1.9 years at an after tax IRR of 21.8%.   

On
July 8, 2016, the Company purchased for $100,507 a 30-acre parcel of private, undeveloped land in Alaska near the Lucky Shot project
for the siting of a gold recovery plant.  

During
the current quarter the Company was engaged in project finance efforts culminating in three project finance term sheets. On September
16, 2016 management entered into a 45-day exclusivity period with one of the short-listed prospective investors. The Company inspected
the Coleman underground works with one prospective project investor at the Lucky Shot project as part of their due diligence period.  

During
August the Company conducted assessment work on the project s State of Alaska claim blocks. One 640-foot surface core drill
hole was completed in an area underlain by the eastern extension of the Murphy Vein block. This drill hole was designed to test
the concept that the zone encountered in the 2005   2009 prior owner drilling program extends across the valley floor at
a depth of about 350 feet. The success of the drill hole provides a much larger resource target area for future exploration drilling.
Following are interval assays:  

During
August and September a third party consulting and engineering firm completed geotechnical and environmental baseline assessment
work on the gold plant mill site including:  

drilled
    four water monitoring wells    

collected
    baseline water quality samples form the four wells   

conducted
    chemical analysis of the water samples collected   

excavated
    four pits to assess mill foundation load bearing strengths   

completed
    laboratory analysis of the ground materials and   

provided
    survey locations.    

Detailed
design and engineering work for the gold recovery plant was continued through the reporting period. The gravity only gold recovery
plant design and final engineering is near complete and ready for construction drawings and plant to be completed. Logistics analyses
have been completed for shipment of required plant equipment, materials and supplies from various vendors to the project site.
The mine engineering work continued for the period on portal and surface logistics and requirements.  

Planning
continues for project permitting, staffing, training and project initiation and startup.  

During
the current period, we retained new legal counsel and terminated the services of our previous legal counsel. The termination resulted
in the Company receiving a settlement of all past and current debt invoices, a mutual release from certain liabilities and obligations,
and a $66,000 gain on the settlement of debt due to a negotiated discount.  

The
total of the $1,508,549 expended exploration and development costs, consists of the exploration and evaluation cost of $949,932
as of March 31, 2016, and the $558,617 development cost during the six months ending at September 30, 2016, consisting of: Mine
Engineering cost (including prepaid) $142,355, Mill Engineering cost $97,133, Metallurgy cost $55,623, Geology cost $40,240, Exploration
drilling cost $50,591, Permitting cost 14,843, development related travel cost $19,349, development related administration cost
$14,787, development related rent cost $8,248, property lease cost $14,917, and Property Acquisition cost $100,531  

Since
our inception, we have incurred operational losses. We have also accumulated net losses since our inception and incurred a net
loss for the most recent audited and interim periods. To finance our operations, we have received advances from related parties,
loan payables and completed several rounds of financing, raising $2,595,350 through private placements of our common stock.  

Results
of Operations    

For
the Three Months ended September 30, 2016   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $66,000 gain on settlement of debt, compared to $nil during the same
period in the prior year.  

During
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss from continuing operations of $403,245, compared to a loss
of $268,617 during the same period in the prior year.  

Our
net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.03. Our net loss per share for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 was $0.03,  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred total expenses of $469,245, compared to total expenses of $268,617 during
the same period in the prior year.  

Our
total expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $40,253 in accounting and legal fees, $251,778 in
development costs, $121,250 in executive compensation, $45,139 in licenses and fees, $347 in bank charges and finance fees, $9,505
in travel costs, and $973 in office expenses. For the same period ended September 30, 2015, we incurred expenses of $28,000 in
accounting and legal fees, $3,744 in advertising and promotion, $53,609 in exploration and evaluation costs, $121,250 in executive
compensation, $43,854 in licenses and fees, $2,578 in bank charges and finance fees, $1,265 in travel costs, $8,850 in share-based
payments, and $5,467 in office expenses. Our total expenses are significantly lower. The variation in expenses is mainly due to
the higher development and exploration fees related to the Lucky Shot property start up.  

For
the Six Months ended September 30, 2016   

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $66,000 gain on settlement of debt, compared to $nil during the same period
in the prior year.  

During
the six month period ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss from continuing operations of $748,010, compared to a loss
of $700,134 during the same period in the prior year.  

Our
net loss per share for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.06. Our net loss per share for the six months ended September
30, 2015 was $0.09,  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred total expenses of $814,010, compared to total expenses of $700,134 during
the same period in the prior year.  

Our
total expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $75,553 in accounting and legal fees, $414,360 in development
costs, $242,500 in executive compensation, $50,499 in licenses and fees, $1,584 in bank charges and finance fees, $23,193 in travel
costs, and $6,321 in office expenses. For the same period ended September 30, 2015, we incurred expenses of $42,500 in accounting
and legal fees, $3,744 in advertising and promotion, $406,104 in exploration and evaluation costs, $121,250 in executive compensation,
$85,015 in licenses and fees, $9,153 in bank charges and finance fees, $12,911 in travel costs, $8,850 in share-based payments,
and $10,607 in office expenses. Our total expenses are similar. The variation in expenses is mainly due to the higher accounting
and legal fees and decreased finance fees due to the payment of loans.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
have limited operational history, and did not generate any revenues besides the gain on settlement of debt. As of September 30,
2016, we had $417,225 in cash and prepaid expenses, $502,341 in total liabilities and a working capital deficit of $85,116. As
of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,791,267. We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing,
related parties, and loan payables. Our operations were funded by equity financing and advances from shareholders and former and
current related parties. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate
any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we used $669,230 in cash on continuing operating activities, and paid back $93,793 in
loans and received net $765,700 from cash provided by financing activities after the investment of land for $100,507 and gained
cash of $96,470. During the same period in fiscal 2015 we used $381,149 in cash on continuing operating activities, and paid back
$201,825 in loans and increased cash of $122,936  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we received an additional $960,000 in proceeds from issuance of common stock, compared
to proceeds of $705,900 in cash during the same period in fiscal 2015. For the period ending September 30, 2016 the Company has
accrued interest of $936 (March 31, 2016 - $13,446).  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, our monthly cash requirements to fund our operating activities, including advances from
former related parties, was approximately $111,538 compared to approximately $63,524 during the same period in fiscal 2015. In
the absence of the continued sale of our common stock or advances from the former or new related parties, our cash of $361,785
as of September 30, 2016 is not sufficient to cover our current monthly burn rate for the foreseeable future and not enough to
pay our current liabilities balance of $502,341. Until we are able to complete private and/or public financing as described below,
we anticipate that we will rely on loans from shareholders to proceed with our plan of operations.  

Our
business strategy going forward is to acquire ownership in late-stage exploration to development-stage gold mining projects and/or
royalty or streaming interests in low capital intensity, mining projects in North America. Our main focus will be on identifying
solid resources, and then utilize funding to bring a distressed asset into production, while either securing equity ownership
or rights of title in the form of royalties.  

We
expect to require approximately $5,000,000 in equity funds and up to $12 to $15 million in project funds to carry out our business
strategy. Our plan of operations over the next 12 months is to obtain the necessary financing to earn at least an additional 25%
interest in the Lucky Shot project by expending $2.44 million and advance the project to production. We also are seeking financing
to earn the full 70% interest available. If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will not be able
to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available
financial resources.  

Future
Financings   

We
have not generated any revenues, have achieved losses since our inception, and rely upon the sale of our securities, loans and
advances from current related parties to fund our operations. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable
future, and we are dependent upon obtaining outside financing to carry out our operations. Our unaudited financial statements
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
will require approximately $5,000,000 over the next 12 months in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, including
paying our ongoing expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly,
we intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months from private placements, advances from related
parties or possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer), or from third party investors
including streaming, royalty and lending investors. If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may
review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. On September 16, 2016 we signed a non-binding term sheet with a prospective
project investor that has a 45-day exclusivity period ending October 31 for Lucky Shot project finance. On October 6 the Company
accompanied a prospective investor to the Coleman underground workings and to the various surface sites on a due diligence visit
in Alaska. There is no guarantee that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable
to us.  

If
we are unable to obtain the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our operations
so as not to exceed the amount of capital resources that are available to us. If we do not secure additional financing our current
cash reserves and working capital will not be sufficient to enable us to sustain our operations for the next 12 months, even if
we do decide to scale back our operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
unaudited interim financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by
management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our unaudited
interim financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation
of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by
our management.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

Our
unaudited financial statements are presented in United States dollars. Transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities, and
at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Expenses are translated at the average rates for the period,
excluding amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related assets. Resulting translation gains or losses are
reflected in net loss.  

Share-Based
Payments   

The
Company records all share-based payments at fair value. Where equity instruments are granted to employees, they are recorded at
the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date. The grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss
over the vesting period, described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied.  

Where
equity instruments are granted to non-employees, they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received. When the
value of goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated, the fair value is measured
by use of a valuation model.  

At
each balance sheet date, the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected
to vest. On the exercise of stock options, common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts
previously recorded to contributed surplus. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value
of share-based payments.  

Recent
Accounting Guidance Adopted   

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

Inflation   

The
amounts presented in the unaudited interim financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or
financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either
by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this
item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
Controls   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed
to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be reported in our Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and
forms, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 using the criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2016, we determined that there were significant deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.  

1.  
      We
    do not have a majority of independent directors. We have no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time.   

2.  
      All
    cash management is conducted solely by the Company s officers, which may result in the misappropriation of funds.   

3.  
      The
    lack of independent directors exercising an oversight role increases the risk of management override and potential fraud.   

4.  
      We
    are in the development stage with limited resources and limited monitoring of internal control and assessment of risk is conducted.   

Management
is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies.  

In
light of the existence of these control deficiencies, management concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s
internal controls.  

As
a result, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2016 based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by COSO.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

NOW
THEREFORE this Agreement witnesses that the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of the respective covenants and
agreements on the part of them herein contained, do hereby covenant each with the other as follows:  

1.  
      Duties
    and Responsibilities   

1.1  
      The
    Company hereby retains the Consultant to perform full time executive, managerial and consulting services to the Company, subject
    to the general direction of the Chief Executive Officer (the  CEO ) of the Company. The Consultant agrees that
    Kunz shall be the sole person entitled and required to provide these services on behalf of the Consultant, and the Consultant

    this Agreement.

1.2  
      The
    Consultant shall, and the Consultant shall cause Kunz to, carry out all lawful instructions and directions given to it or
    him by the CEO from time to time and perform its or his duties to the utmost of its or his ability. The Consultant shall use
    its best efforts to promote the interests and goodwill of the Company and shall conduct itself, and shall cause Kunz to conduct
    itself, in a diligent, competent and businesslike manner.   

1.3  
      The
    Consultant agrees that it will cause Kunz to undertake such reasonable amount of travel away from the principal office of
    the Company as may be reasonably necessary and the Company agrees to reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred by the Consultant
    in that regard.   

1.4  
      The
    Consultant shall be an independent contractor and not the servant, employee or agent of the Company.   

1.5  
      The
    character of the Consultant s service contract and the Consultant s remuneration may be changed from time to time
    by mutual written consent without thereby terminating this Agreement and, notwithstanding any change in the Consultant s
    services to the Company in any capacity whatsoever and at whatever compensation, the Consultant s engagement shall be
    construed as continuing under this Agreement as modified.   

2.  
      Term   

2.1  
      The
    term ( Term ) of the Consultant s engagement under this Agreement shall commence on July 1, 2015 and, except
    in the case of earlier termination as hereinafter specifically provided for, shall continue for a period of two years and
    shall be automatically renewed for an additional year on each anniversary thereafter of this Agreement unless otherwise terminated
    as provided for hereunder.

    services required of him under the terms of this Agreement during the hours that are commensurate with his position and duties,
    having regard to prevailing industry standards for similar businesses operated in accordance with sound and efficient business
    policies. The Consultant acknowledges that in the performance of his duties in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries,
    Kunz will be required from time to time to travel and perform his duties and fulfil his responsibilities elsewhere than at
    the Company s principal office in Vancouver as may be necessary for the furtherance and conduct of the business of the
    Company.   

3.2  
      Notwithstanding
    section 3.1, the Company acknowledges that Kunz has other business interests. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees that
    Kunz s other interests shall not interfere with Kunz s duties hereunder.   

3.3  
      The
    Consultant shall refer to the CEO all matters and transactions in which a real or perceived conflict of interest between the
    Consultant and the Company may arise, however remote the possibility, and shall not proceed with such matters or transactions
    until the CEO s approval thereof is obtained. For purposes of clarification, this section 3.3 is not intended to limit
    in any way the other fiduciary obligations of Kunz to the Company which may arise in law or equity.

    of the Company and are reasonable and valid, and the Consultant hereby waives all defences to the strict enforcement thereof
    by the Company.   

8.

8.1  
      The
    invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
    provision, and any invalid provision will be severable from this Agreement and the remaining provisions thereof shall remain
    in force and be binding upon the parties as though the severed provision or provisions had never been included.   

9.  
      Governing
    Law

NOW
THEREFORE this Agreement witnesses that the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of the respective covenants and
agreements on the part of them herein contained, do hereby covenant each with the other as follows:  

1.  
      Duties
    and Responsibilities   

1.1  
      The
    Company hereby retains the Consultant to perform full time executive, managerial and consulting services to the Company, subject
    to the general direction of the Chief Executive Officer (the  CEO ) of the Company. The Consultant agrees that
    Kunz shall be the sole person entitled and required to provide these services on behalf of the Consultant, and the Consultant
    shall also cause Kunz and only Kunz to act as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and to serve as a
    director of the Company and to hold such additional offices to which he may be appointed by the Company or any subsidiary
    of the Company. The Consultant will cause Kunz to accept these positions subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
    this Agreement.   

Alex
Kunz Emp Agrmt   

1.2  
      The
    Consultant shall, and the Consultant shall cause Kunz to, carry out all lawful instructions and directions given to it or
    him by the CEO from time to time and perform its or his duties to the utmost of its or his ability. The Consultant shall use
    its best efforts to promote the interests and goodwill of the Company and shall conduct itself, and shall cause Kunz to conduct
    itself, in a diligent, competent and businesslike manner.   

1.3  
      The
    Consultant agrees that it will cause Kunz to undertake such reasonable amount of travel away from the principal office of
    the Company as may be reasonably necessary and the Company agrees to reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred by the Consultant
    in that regard.   

1.4  
      The
    Consultant shall be an independent contractor and not the servant, employee or agent of the Company.   

1.5  
      The
    character of the Consultant s service contract and the Consultant s remuneration may be changed from time to time
    by mutual written consent without thereby terminating this Agreement and, notwithstanding any change in the Consultant s
    services to the Company in any capacity whatsoever and at whatever compensation, the Consultant s engagement shall be
    construed as continuing under this Agreement as modified.   

2.  
      Term   

2.1  
      The
    term ( Term ) of the Consultant s engagement under this Agreement shall commence on July 1, 2015 and, except
    in the case of earlier termination as hereinafter specifically provided for, shall continue for a period of two years and
    shall be automatically renewed for an additional year on each anniversary thereafter of this Agreement unless otherwise terminated
    as provided for hereunder.   

3.  
      Conflicts
    of Interest   

3.1  
      The
    Consultant shall cause Kunz to devote his business time, best efforts, skills and attention on a full time basis to perform
    his duties and responsibilities hereunder faithfully and diligently. The Consultant shall cause Kunz to perform the work and
    services required of him under the terms of this Agreement during the hours that are commensurate with his position and duties,
    having regard to prevailing industry standards for similar businesses operated in accordance with sound and efficient business
    policies. The Consultant acknowledges that in the performance of his duties in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries,
    Kunz will be required from time to time to travel and perform his duties and fulfil his responsibilities elsewhere than at
    the Company s principal office in Vancouver as may be necessary for the furtherance and conduct of the business of the
    Company.   

3.2  
      Notwithstanding
    section 3.1, the Company acknowledges that Kunz has other business interests. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees that
    Kunz s other interests shall not interfere with Kunz s duties hereunder.   

3.3  
      The
    Consultant shall refer to the CEO all matters and transactions in which a real or perceived conflict of interest between the
    Consultant and the Company may arise, however remote the possibility, and shall not proceed with such matters or transactions
    until the CEO s approval thereof is obtained. For purposes of clarification, this section 3.3 is not intended to limit
    in any way the other fiduciary obligations of Kunz to the Company which may arise in law or equity.

NOW
THEREFORE this Agreement witnesses that the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of the respective covenants and
agreements on the part of them herein contained, do hereby covenant each with the other as follows:  

1.  
      Duties
    and Responsibilities   

1.1  
      The
    Company hereby retains the Consultant to perform full time executive, managerial and consulting services to the Company, subject
    to the general direction of the Chief Executive Officer (the  CEO ) of the Company. The Consultant agrees that
    Hart shall be the sole person entitled and required to provide these services on behalf of the Consultant, and the Consultant
    shall also cause Hart and only Hart to act as President of the Company and to serve as a director of the Company and to hold
    such additional offices to which he may be appointed by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. The Consultant will
    cause Hart to accept these positions subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

1.2  
      The
    Consultant shall, and the Consultant shall cause Hart to, carry out all lawful instructions and directions given to it or
    him by the CEO from time to time and perform its or his duties to the utmost of its or his ability. The Consultant shall use
    its best efforts to promote the interests and goodwill of the Company and shall conduct itself, and shall cause Hart to conduct
    itself, in a diligent, competent and businesslike manner.   

1.3  
      The
    Consultant agrees that it will cause Hart to undertake such reasonable amount of travel away from the principal office of
    the Company as may be reasonably necessary and the Company agrees to reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred by the Consultant
    in that regard.   

1.4  
      The
    Consultant shall be an independent contractor and not the servant, employee or agent of the Company.   

1.5  
      The
    character of the Consultant s service contract and the Consultant s remuneration may be changed from time to time
    by mutual written consent without thereby terminating this Agreement and, notwithstanding any change in the Consultant s
    services to the Company in any capacity whatsoever and at whatever compensation, the Consultant s engagement shall be
    construed as continuing under this Agreement as modified.   

2.  
      Term   

2.1  
      The
    term ( Term ) of the Consultant s engagement under this Agreement shall commence on July 1, 2015 and, except
    in the case of earlier termination as hereinafter specifically provided for, shall continue for a period of two years and
    shall be automatically renewed for an additional year on each anniversary thereafter of this Agreement unless otherwise terminated
    as provided for hereunder.   

3.  
      Conflicts
    of Interest   

3.1  
      The
    Consultant shall cause Hart to devote his business time, best efforts, skills and attention on a full time basis to perform
    his duties and responsibilities hereunder faithfully and diligently. The Consultant shall cause Hart to perform the work and
    services required of him under the terms of this Agreement during the hours that are commensurate with his position and duties,
    having regard to prevailing industry standards for similar businesses operated in accordance with sound and efficient business
    policies. The Consultant acknowledges that in the performance of his duties in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries,
    Hart will be required from time to time to travel and perform his duties and fulfil his responsibilities elsewhere than at
    the Company s principal office in Vancouver as may be necessary for the furtherance and conduct of the business of the
    Company.   

3.2  
      Notwithstanding
    section 3.1, the Company acknowledges that Hart has other business interests. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees that
    Hart s other interests shall not interfere with Hart s duties hereunder.   

3.3  
      The
    Consultant shall refer to the CEO all matters and transactions in which a real or perceived conflict of interest between the
    Consultant and the Company may arise, however remote the possibility, and shall not proceed with such matters or transactions
    until the CEO s approval thereof is obtained. For purposes of clarification, this section 3.3 is not intended to limit
    in any way the other fiduciary obligations of Hart to the Company which may arise in law or equity.   

4.  
      Fees
    and Benefits   

4.1

      the
    payment of a consulting fee of $170,000 per annum subject to annual adjustment as the Board of Directors ( Board )
    in its discretion may determine, one-twelfth of which amount is payable monthly on the last day of each month; and   

(b)  
      the
    payment of an annual bonus, if any, at the Board s discretion based upon performance of the Consultant and the Company
    during the preceding fiscal year, to be determined and payable as soon as practicable after the Company s fiscal year.   

4.2  
      The
    Consultant and/or Hart shall be entitled to participate in the Company s stock option plan on such terms and conditions
    as would be commensurate with his positions with the Company, recognizing that the terms of option grants are at the sole
    discretion of the Company s Compensation Committee and Board of Directors.   

4.3  
      The
    Consultant and/or Hart shall be entitled to participate in any and all benefit plans that the Company provides to its employees
    generally.   

4.4  
      The
    Company shall reimburse the Consultant and Hart for all reasonable and documented travel, entertainment and other business
    expenses actually and properly incurred by it or him in relation to the Company s business as they are incurred, subject
    to approval by the Lead Director of the Company in the event such expenses fall outside of budgeted amounts.   

4.5  
      The
    Consultant shall, without any deduction of its fee payable hereunder, be allowed a hiatus from performing its duties hereunder
    for a period of four weeks during each year of its engagement hereunder at such time or times as may be selected by the Consultant
    and as are in accordance with the Company s reasonable policies and operating requirements.   

4.6  
      Hart
    shall, throughout the Term, be the employee of the Consultant and not of the Company, and the Consultant shall pay any and
    all taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, pension premiums or contributions and any other statutory payments or assessments
    of any nature or kind whatsoever that are payable by virtue of the relationship of employer and employee existing between
    the Consultant and Hart.

    the Term with the express prior written consent of the Company; or   

(c)  
      when
    the Company is in material default of any of its obligations under section 4 hereof, in which event the Consultant may, where
    such default has not been cured within 15 days of delivery of notice thereof in writing to the Company, terminate its engagement

(g)  
      if
    the Consultant, by reason of illness or mental or physical disability or incapacity of Hart, fails to provide his services
    as set out in section 1 above for any two (2) consecutive calendar months, then by one (1) month s notice in writing

    to receive any additional severance payment or additional compensation for loss of office or otherwise by reason of the resignation.

    or Hart in the performance of its or his duties herein prescribed or otherwise belonging to the Company.   

5.5  
      The
    termination of the Consultant s engagement hereunder will not affect the provisions of section 7 of this Agreement which
    shall survive such termination and continue in full force and effect.   

6.

    meaning of the Securities Act), becoming, following the date of this Agreement, the beneficial owner (also within the meaning
    of the Securities Act) of more than 50% of the total voting rights attaching to all classes then outstanding of the Company

b.  
      Any fraud, whether
    or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal
