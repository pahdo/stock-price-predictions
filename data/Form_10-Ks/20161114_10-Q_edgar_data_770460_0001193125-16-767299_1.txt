PEOPLES FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 1. Basis of Presentation:    Peoples Financial Corporation (the
 Company ) is a one-bank holding company headquartered in Biloxi, Mississippi. It has two operating subsidiaries, PFC Service Corp., an inactive company, and The Peoples Bank, Biloxi, Mississippi (the  Bank ). The Bank provides a
full range of banking, financial and trust services to state, county and local government entities and individuals and small and commercial businesses operating in those portions of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama which are within a fifty mile
radius of the Waveland, Wiggins and Gautier branches, the Bank s three most outlying locations (the  trade area ).    The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( GAAP ), the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the periods presented. The interim financial information should be read
in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report and Form 10-K.  
 The results of operations for the quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year.   Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates common to the banking industry that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include, but are not limited to, the determination of the allowance for loan
losses, the valuation of other real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans and valuation allowances associated with the realization of deferred tax assets, which are based on future taxable income.  
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking
industry. There have been no material changes or developments in the application of principles or in our evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies that we believe to be Critical Accounting Policies as
disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    New Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 82) . ASU 2016-02 provides certain targeted improvements to align lessor accounting with the lessee
accounting model. This update will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods  
      10  

within those fiscal years, beginning after January 1, 2019. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.    In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-03,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350); Business Combinations (Topic 805);
Consolidation (Topic 810); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effective Date and Transition Guidance.  ASU 2016-03 amends the guidance in ASUs 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014-07 and 2014-18 to remove their effective dates and render them effective
immediately. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-07,  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of
Accounting . ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment,
results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step by step basis. This update will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of ASU 2016-13 will require financial institutions and other organizations to use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates.
In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available for sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. This update will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of determining
the effect of ASU 2016-13 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) . ASU 2016-15 provides classification guidance in order to reduce diversity in practice for certain transactions.
Such transactions include debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from
the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, distributions received from equity method investments, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This
update will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

2. Earnings Per Share:  
 Per share data is based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding of 5,123,186 for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.    3. Statements of Cash Flows:    The Company has
defined cash and cash equivalents as cash and due from banks. The Company paid $761,440 and $655,764 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for interest on deposits and borrowings. Income tax payments of
$78,435 were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Loans transferred to other real estate amounted to $1,758,764 and $7,278,605 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
      12  

4. Investments:  
 The amortized cost and fair value of securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):  

13  

The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2016 (in thousands), by contractual maturity, are shown
on the following page. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  
      14  

15  

Available for sale and held to maturity securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, are as follows (in thousands):      
   At September 30, 2016, 2 of the 26 U.S. Treasuries, 2 of the 7 U.S. Government Agencies, 2 of the 13 mortgage-backed
securities, 24 of the 145 securities issued by states and political subdivisions and the corporate bond contained unrealized losses.    Management evaluates
securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a monthly basis. In performing this evaluation, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the fact that the Company s securities are primarily issued by
U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agencies and the cause of the decline in value are considered. In addition, the Company does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before maturity.
While some available for sale securities have been sold for liquidity purposes or for gains, the Company has traditionally held its securities, including those classified as available for sale, until maturity. As a result of the evaluation of
these securities, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses summarized in the tables above are not deemed to be other-than-temporary.  
      16  

As part of its routine evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company identified a
potential credit loss on bonds issued by a municipality with a carrying value of $1,875,000 at September 30, 2015. The Company s evaluation considered the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest payments and expectations of future
performance. Principal and interest payments due under the current terms of the bonds are funded by sales and property tax collections by the related municipality. During the third quarter of 2015, the assessed value of the related
real estate parcels was significantly reduced, which will reduce the level of future cash flows supporting the principal and interest payments on the bonds. The present value of the expected future cash flows was calculated by the
Company. Based on its evaluation, it was determined that the investment in the bonds is impaired and that a credit loss should be recognized in earnings. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a loss of $1,695,000 from the
credit impairment of these bonds. Accrued interest of $92,564 relating to these securities was also charged off during the third quarter of 2015.  
 Proceeds from sales and calls of available for sale securities were $29,250,806 and $5,600,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Available for sale debt securities were sold or called for a realized gain of $157,918 and $7,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Securities with a fair value of $182,864,903 and $168,724,920 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged to secure public
deposits, federal funds purchased and other balances required by law.    5. Loans:  
 The composition of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is as follows (in thousands):  

17  

The age analysis of the loan portfolio, segregated by class of loans, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, is as follows (in thousands):      
   The Company monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio through the use of a loan grading system. A score of 1
  5 is assigned to the loan on factors including repayment ability, trends in net worth and/or financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, employment stability, management ability, loan to value fluctuations, the type and structure of
the loan, conformity of the loan to bank policy and payment performance. Based on the total score, a loan grade of A, B, C, S, D, E or F is applied. A grade of A will generally be applied to loans for customers that are well known to the
Company and that have excellent sources of repayment. A grade of B will generally be applied to loans for customers that have excellent sources of repayment which have no identifiable risk of collection. A grade of C will generally be applied to
loans for customers that have adequate sources of repayment which have little identifiable risk of collection. A grade of S will generally be applied to loans for customers who meet the criteria for a grade of C but also warrant additional
monitoring by placement on the watch list. A grade of D will generally be applied to loans for customers that are inadequately protected by current sound net worth, paying capacity of the borrower, or pledged collateral. Loans with a grade of D
have unsatisfactory characteristics such as cash flow deficiencies, bankruptcy filing by the borrower or dependence on the sale of collateral for the primary source of repayment, causing more than acceptable levels of risk. Loans 60 to 89 days past
due receive a grade of D. A grade of E will generally be applied to loans for customers with weaknesses inherent in the  D  classification and in which collection or liquidation in full is questionable. In addition, on a monthly basis the
Company determines which loans are 90 days or more past due and assigns a grade of E to them. A grade of F is applied to loans which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance in an active bank is not warranted.
Loans with this grade are charged off, even though partial or full recovery may be possible in the future.  
      18  

An analysis of the loan portfolio by loan grade, segregated by class of loans, as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, is as follows (in thousands):      
 
      19  

A loan may be impaired but not on nonaccrual status when the loan is well secured and in the process of
collection. Total loans on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
   The Company has modified certain loans by granting interest rate concessions to these customers. These loans are in
compliance with their modified terms, are currently accruing and the Company has classified them as troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands except
for number of contracts):      
 
      20  

Impaired loans, which include loans classified as nonaccrual and troubled debt restructurings, segregated by
class of loans, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
 
      21

6. Allowance for Loan Losses:  
 Transactions in the allowance for loan losses for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the balances of loans, individually and
collectively evaluated for impairment, as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
 
      23  

7. Deposits:    Time deposits
of $100,000 or more at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included brokered deposits of $5,000,000, which mature in 2017.    Time deposits of $250,000
or more totaled approximately $26,853,000 and $24,090,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    8. Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures:    The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value
disclosures. Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record other assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as impaired loans
and ORE. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Additionally, the Company is required to disclose, but not record, the fair value
of other financial instruments.  
      24  

Fair Value Hierarchy   
 The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the
reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:    Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments
traded in active markets.    Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.  
 Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable
assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.  
 Following is a description of valuation methodologies used to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.  
  Cash and Due from Banks     The carrying amount shown as
cash and due from banks approximates fair value.     Available for Sale Securities   
 The fair value of available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices. The Company s available for sale securities are reported at their
estimated fair value, which is determined utilizing several sources. The primary source is Interactive Data Corporation, which utilizes pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid and other market information and
whose methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models and vast descriptive databases. Another source for determining fair value is matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without
relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark securities. The Company s available for sale securities for which fair value is determined through
the use of such pricing models and matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 assets. If the fair value of available for sale securities is generated through model-based techniques, including the discounting of estimated cash flows, such
securities are classified as Level 3 assets.     Held to Maturity Securities   
 The fair value of held to maturity securities is based on quoted market prices.  
  Other Investments     The carrying amount shown as other
investments approximates fair value.  
      25  

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock   
 The carrying amount shown as Federal Home Loan Bank Stock approximates fair value.  
  Loans     The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining maturities. The cash flows considered in computing the fair value of such loans are
segmented into categories relating to the nature of the contract and collateral based on contractual principal maturities. Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect probable credit losses. Cash flows have not been adjusted for such factors as
prepayment risk or the effect of the maturity of balloon notes. The fair value of floating rate loans is estimated to be its carrying value. At each reporting period, the Company determines which loans are impaired. Accordingly, the Company s
impaired loans are reported at their estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis. An allowance for each impaired loan, which are generally collateral-dependent, is calculated based on the fair value of its collateral. The fair value of the
collateral is based on appraisals performed by third-party valuation specialists. Factors including the assumptions and techniques utilized by the appraiser are considered by Management. If the recorded investment in the impaired loan exceeds
the measure of fair value of the collateral, a valuation allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans are non-recurring Level 3 assets.  
  Other Real Estate     In the course of lending operations,
Management may determine that it is necessary to foreclose on the related collateral. Other real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral is based on appraisals
performed by third-party valuation specialists. Factors including the assumptions and techniques utilized by the appraiser are considered by Management. If the current appraisal is more than one year old and/or the loan balance is more than
$200,000, a new appraisal is obtained. Otherwise, the Bank s in-house property evaluator and Management will determine the fair value of the collateral, based on comparable sales, market conditions, Management s plans for disposition and
other estimates of fair value obtained from principally independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Other real estate is a non-recurring Level 3 asset. 
  Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance     The carrying
amount of cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance approximates fair value.     Deposits   
 The fair value of non-interest bearing demand and interest bearing savings and demand deposits is the amount reported in the financial statements. The fair
value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the cash flows using current rates of time deposits with similar remaining maturities. The cash flows considered in computing the fair value of such deposits are based on contractual maturities,
since approximately 98% of time deposits provide for automatic renewal at current interest rates.  
      26  

Borrowings from Federal Home Loan Bank   
 The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) fixed rate borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flows based on current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The fair value of FHLB variable rate borrowings is estimated to be its carrying value.  
 The balances of available for sale securities, which are the only assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy
and by investment type, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):     
   Impaired loans, which are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):     
   Other real estate, which is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):      
 
      27

9. Reclassifications:    Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year statements to conform to current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income (loss).

     GENERAL     The Company is a one-bank holding
company headquartered in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Company has two operating subsidiaries, PFC Service Corp., an inactive company, and The Peoples Bank, Biloxi, Mississippi (the  Bank ). The Bank provides a full range of banking,
financial and trust services to state, county and local government entities and individuals and small and commercial businesses operating in those portions of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama which are within a fifty mile radius of the Waveland,
Wiggins and Gautier branches, the Bank s three most outlying locations (the  trade area ).   The following presents Management s
discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Peoples Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries. These comments should be considered in combination with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report on Form 10-Q and the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis included in the Company s Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Forward-Looking Information   
 Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 in an effort to encourage corporations to provide information about a company s anticipated
future financial performance. This act provides a safe harbor for such disclosure which protects the companies from unwarranted litigation if actual results are different from management expectations. This report contains forward-looking
statements and reflects industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause the Company s actual results and experience to
differ from the anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. Such factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in interest rates and market prices, changes in local economic and
business conditions, increased competition for deposits and loans, a deviation in actual experience from the underlying assumptions used to determine and establish the allowance for loan losses, changes in the availability of funds resulting from
reduced liquidity, changes in government regulations and acts of terrorism, weather or other events beyond the Company s control.     New Accounting
Pronouncements     The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has issued several new accounting standards updates for the first three
quarters of 2016 which are disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not generally expect that these updates will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations but the
effect of ASU 2016-13 is still being considered.  
      30  

Critical Accounting Policies   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when
facts and circumstances dictate. Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
  Investments     Investments which are classified as
available for sale are stated at fair value. A decline in the market value of an investment below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary is charged to earnings for the decline in value deemed to be credit related and a new cost basis in
the security is established. The decline in value attributed to non-credit related factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The determination of the fair value of securities may require Management to develop estimates and
assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows.     Allowance for loan losses   
 The Company s most critical accounting policy relates to its allowance for loan losses ( ALL ), which reflects the estimated losses resulting
from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments. The ALL is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated loss associated with the loan portfolio of the Company as of the date of the financial
statements. Credit losses arise not only from credit risk, but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including, but not limited to, collateral risk, operation risk, concentration risk and economic risk. As such, all related
risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the ALL. On a quarterly basis, Management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable, anticipated losses
in the existing portfolio based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risk in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers  ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current
economic conditions. Management believes that the ALL is adequate and appropriate for all periods presented in these financial statements. If there was a deterioration of any of the factors considered by Management in evaluating the ALL,
the estimate of loss would be updated, and additional provisions for loan losses may be required. The analysis divides the portfolio into two segments: a pool analysis of loans based upon a five year average loss history which is updated on a
quarterly basis and which may be adjusted by qualitative factors by loan type and a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under GAAP. All credit relationships with an outstanding balance of $100,000 or greater that are
included in Management s loan watch list are individually reviewed for impairment. All losses are charged to the ALL when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur; recoveries are credited to the
ALL at the time of receipt.  
      31  

Other Real Estate   
 Other real estate ( ORE ) includes real estate acquired through foreclosure. Each ORE property is carried at fair value, less estimated costs to
sell. Fair value is principally based on appraisals performed by third-party valuation specialists. If Management determines that the fair value of a property has decreased subsequent to foreclosure, the Company records a write down which
is included in non-interest expense.     Employee Benefit Plans   
 Employee benefit plan liabilities and pension costs are determined utilizing actuarially determined present value calculations. The valuation of the
benefit obligation and net periodic expense is considered critical, as it requires Management and its actuaries to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows including assumptions about mortality, expected service
periods and the rate of compensation increases.     Income Taxes   
 GAAP requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes. We use the asset and liability method of
accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate our
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for
loan losses, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated statement of condition. We must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax
assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes,
our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. To the extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance or adjusts this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or
benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income.     OVERVIEW   
 The Company is a community bank serving the financial and trust needs of its customers in our trade area, which is defined as those portions of Mississippi,
Louisiana and Alabama which are within a fifty mile radius of the Waveland, Wiggins and Gautier branches, the bank subsidiary s three most outlying locations. Maintaining a strong core deposit base and providing commercial and real estate
lending in our trade area are the traditional focuses of the Company. Growth has largely been achieved through de novo branching activity, and it is expected that these strategies will continue to be emphasized in the future.  
      32  

The Company earned net income of $406,000 for the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $2,553,000
for the third quarter of 2015 and earned net income of $543,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 compared with a net loss of $5,309,000 for the first three quarters of 2015. Results in 2016 for both time periods included decreases in the
provision for the allowance for loan losses and non-interest expense which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income as compared with 2015. In addition, non-interest income decreased for the first three quarters of 2016 as
compared with 2015.    Managing the net interest margin in the Company s highly competitive market and in context of larger economic conditions has
been very challenging and will continue to be so, for the foreseeable future. Net interest income was impacted primarily by the decrease in interest on U.S. Government agency securities of $314,000 and $806,000 for the third quarter and first
three quarters ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared with 2015. This decrease in both time periods is the result of recent purchases of these securities having shorter durations, and therefore lower yields, in anticipation of
rising rates as well as proceeds from calls and maturities of U.S. Agency securities being invested in U.S. Treasury securities which generally have a lower rate.  
 Monitoring asset quality, estimating potential losses in our loan portfolio and addressing non-performing loans continue to be emphasized during these
difficult economic times, as the local economy continues to negatively impact collateral values and borrowers  ability to repay their loans. The Company did not record a provision for the allowance for loan losses for the third quarter of
2016 and only recorded a provision of $137,000 for the first three quarters of 2016. Provisions for the allowance for loan losses of $285,000 and $2,807,000, respectively, were recorded for the third quarter and first three quarters of
2015. The Company is working diligently to address and reduce its non-performing assets. The Company s nonaccrual loans totaled $13,491,000 and $15,186,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Most of these loans
are collateral-dependent, and the Company has rigorously evaluated the value of its collateral to determine potential losses.   Non-interest income
increased $82,000 for the third quarter of 2016 and decreased $493,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 as compared with 2015 results. The increase between the quarters primarily is the result of the gain on the liquidation, sale and calls
of securities of $67,000 during the third quarter of 2016. The decrease between the three quarters is the result of service charges on deposit accounts decreasing $535,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as
a result of decreased ATM fee income.    Non-interest expense decreased $2,777,000 and $4,466,000 for the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 as
compared with 2015 results. This decrease for the third quarter of 2016 was the result of the decrease in ORE expense of $936,000 as compared with 2015 and 2015 s results including the loss on credit impairment of securities of
$1,695,000. This decrease for the first three quarters of 2016 was the result of decreases in salaries and employee benefits of $613,000, ATM expenses of $582,000 and ORE expense of $1,204,000 as compared with 2015 and 2015 s results
including the loss on credit impairment of securities.  
      33  

Total assets at September 30, 2016 increased $41,517,000 as compared with December 31, 2015. Cash and due
from banks increased $33,113,000 and held to maturity securities increased $16,499,000 at September 30, 2016. These increases were funded by total deposits which increased $50,853,000 at September 30, 2016 as compared with December 31, 2015 as
customers in the casino industry and county and municipal entities reallocate their resources periodically.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  Net Interest Income     Net interest income, the amount by
which interest income on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds, is the single largest component of the Company s income. Management s objective is to provide
the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risk. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest
directly affect net interest income.     Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2015   
 The Company s average interest-earning assets increased approximately $12,797,000, or 2%, from approximately $591,211,000 for the third quarter of 2015 to
approximately $604,008,000 for the third quarter of 2016. Average balances due from financial institutions increased approximately $49,872,000 as a result of the decrease in average loans and the increase in average savings and interest-bearing
DDA. The Company s average loans decreased approximately $30,673,000 as principal payments, maturities, charge-offs and foreclosures relating to existing loans outpaced new loans.  
 The average yield on earning assets decreased by 15 basis points, from 3.30% for the third quarter of 2015 to 3.15% for the third quarter of 2016. The
yield on average loans increased from 4.13% for the third quarter of 2015 to 4.40% for the third quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in prime rate during December 2015 on the Company s floating rate loans.
Offsetting this was the yield on average taxable available for sale securities which decreased from 1.75% for the third quarter of 2015 to 1.27% for the third quarter of 2016 as recent purchases have shorter durations, and therefore lower yields, in
anticipation of rising rates.    Average interest bearing liabilities increased approximately $2,135,000, or .50%, from approximately $441,456,000 for the
third quarter of 2015 to approximately $443,591,000 for the third quarter of 2016. Average savings and interest bearing DDA balances increased approximately $15,725,000 primarily as several large commercial customers reallocate their balances
periodically. Average borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased approximately $18,158,000 due to the liquidity needs of the bank subsidiary. 
 The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2015 was .21% as compared with .24% for the third quarter of 2016. 
      34  

The Company s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of
average earning assets, was 3.14% for the third quarter of 2015 as compared with 2.97% for the third quarter of 2016.    Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     The Company s average interest-earning assets decreased approximately $14,620,000, or
2%, from approximately $606,993,000 for the first three quarters of 2015 to approximately $592,373,000 for the first three quarters of 2016. Average balances due from financial institutions increased approximately $21,742,000 primarily as a
result of the decrease in average loans. The Company s average loans decreased approximately $30,079,000 as principal payments, maturities, charge-offs and foreclosures relating to existing loans outpaced new loans.  
 The average yield on earning assets decreased by 6 basis points, from 3.30% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 3.24% for the first three quarters of
2016. The yield on average loans increased from 4.07% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 4.36% for the first three quarters of 2016 primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in prime rate during December 2015 on the
Company s floating rate loans. The yield on average taxable available for sale securities decreased from 1.73% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 1.35% for the first three quarters of 2016 as recent purchases have shorter durations,
and therefore lower yields, in anticipation of rising rates.    Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased approximately $17,536,000, or 4%, from
approximately $464,011,000 for the first three quarters of 2015 to approximately $446,475,000 for the first three quarters of 2016. Average borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased approximately $19,120,000 due to the liquidity
needs of the bank subsidiary.   The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the first three quarters of 2015 was .19% compared with .23% for
the first two quarters of 2016.    The Company s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average
earning assets, was 3.15% for the first three quarters of 2015 as compared with 3.07% for the first three quarters of 2016.   The tables on the following
pages analyze the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

    Provision for Loan Losses   
 In the normal course of business, the Company assumes risk in extending credit to its customers. This credit risk is managed through compliance with the
loan policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The policy establishes guidelines relating to underwriting standards, including but not limited to financial analysis, collateral valuation, lending limits, pricing considerations and
loan grading. The Company s Loan Review and Special Assets Departments play key roles in monitoring the loan portfolio and managing problem loans. New loans and, on a periodic basis, existing loans are reviewed to evaluate compliance
with the loan policy. Loan customers in concentrated industries such as gaming and hotel/motel, as well as the exposure for out of area; residential and land development; construction and commercial real estate loans, and their direct and
indirect impact on its operations are evaluated on a monthly basis. Loan delinquencies and deposit overdrafts are closely monitored in order to identify developing problems as early as possible. Lenders experienced in workout scenarios
consult with loan officers and customers to address non-performing loans. A watch list of credits which pose a potential loss to the Company is prepared based on the loan grading system. This list forms the foundation of the Company s
allowance for loan loss computation.   Management relies on its guidelines and existing methodology to monitor the performance of its loan portfolio and
identify and estimate potential losses based on the best available information. The potential effect of the continuing decline in real estate values and actual losses incurred by the Company were key factors in our analysis. Much of the
Company s loan portfolio is collateral-dependent, requiring careful consideration of changes in the value of the collateral.  
      39  

The Company s analysis includes evaluating the current values of collateral securing all nonaccrual
loans. Even though nonaccrual loans were $13,491,000 and $15,186,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, specific reserves of only $1,258,000 and $1,697,000, respectively, have been allocated to these loans as collateral
values appear sufficient to cover loan losses or the loan balances have been charged down to their realizable value.    The Company records a provision for
loan losses based on its on-going, systematic evaluation. This process resulted in the Company recording no provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2016 and a provision for loan losses of $285,000 for the third quarter of 2015 and
$137,000 and $2,807,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 2.14% and 2.39% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company believes
that its allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of September 30, 2016.    The allowance for loan losses is an estimate, and as such, events may occur
in the future which may affect its accuracy. The Company anticipates that it is possible that additional information will be gathered in future quarters which may require an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. Management will
continue to closely monitor its portfolio and take such action as it deems appropriate to accurately report its financial condition and results of operations.  
  Non-interest income      Quarter Ended September 30, 2016
as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2015     Non-interest income increased $82,000 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared with the third
quarter of 2015 primarily as the Company realized a gain of $67,000 in 2016 from the liquidation, sale and call of securities as compared with $8,000 in 2015.  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Non-interest income decreased $493,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 as compared with the first three quarters of 2015 primarily as the result of the
decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of $535,000. More specifically, ATM fee income decreased $451,000 as the Company s off-site ATMs at two casinos transferred to other vendors. The Company also realized a gain of $158,000 from
the liquidation, sale and call of securities in 2016 as compared with $8,000 in 2015.  
      40  

Non-interest expense   
  Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2015   
 Total non-interest expense decreased $2,777,000 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared with the third quarter of 2015. This decrease is partly due to
the decrease in other real estate expense in 2016 as compared with 2015. This decrease of $936,000 was the result of the decrease in ORE and the impact of the auction of properties in 2015. The decrease in total non-interest expense is
also the result of the Company recording a loss from the credit impairment of a municipal security of $1,695,000 in 2015.     Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     Total non-interest expense decreased $4,466,000 for the first three quarters of 2016 as
compared with the first three quarters of 2015. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $613,000, ATM expense decreased $582,000 and other real estate expense decreased $1,204,000 in 2016 as compared with 2015. The Company recorded a loss
from the credit impairment of a municipal security of $1,695,000 in 2015.    Salaries and employee benefits decreased in 2016 as salaries decreased $231,000
as a result of attrition and health insurance costs declined $348,000 as a result of decreasing claims.    ATM expenses decreased in 2016 as a result of
decreased ATM activity in the current year as a result of off-site ATMs at two casinos transferring to other vendors.   ORE expense decreased in 2016 as
compared with 2015 due to the decrease in ORE and the impact of the auction of properties in 2015.    Income Taxes   
 At December 31, 2014, the Company established a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. Until such time as the Company returns to sustained
earnings, and it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, no income tax benefit or expense will generally be recorded. The Company did record income tax expense of $78,000 during the
second quarter of 2016 relating to the resolution of a recent examination by the Internal Revenue Service.     FINANCIAL CONDITION   
 Cash and due from banks increased $33,113,000 at September 30, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015 in the management of the bank subsidiary s liquidity
position.   Held to maturity securities increased $16,499,000 at September 30, 2016, compared with December 31, 2015 as the Company has invested some of its
excess funding in order to increase its interest income.    Loan decreased $13,450,000 at September 30, 2016, as compared with December 31, 2015 as
principal payments, maturities, charge-offs and foreclosures relating to existing loans outpaced new loans.  
      41  

Total deposits increased $50,853,000 at September 30, 2016, as compared with December 31, 2015. Typically,
significant increases or decreases in total deposits and/or significant fluctuations among the different types of deposits from quarter to quarter are anticipated by Management as customers in the casino industry and county and municipal entities
reallocate their resources periodically.   Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased $12,070,000 at September 30, 2016 as compared with
December 31, 2015 based on the liquidity needs of the bank subsidiary.     SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY   
 Strength, security and stability have been the hallmark of the Company since its founding in 1985 and of its bank subsidiary since its founding in 1896. A
strong capital foundation is fundamental to the continuing prosperity of the Company and the security of its customers and shareholders.   New rules
relating to risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating components of capital and of computing risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and
certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. The rules establish a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement, increase the minimum capital ratios and assign a higher risk weight to certain
assets based on the risk associated with these assets.    As of September 30, 2016, the most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation categorized the bank subsidiary as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the bank subsidiary must have a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00% or greater,
a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.50% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00% or greater and a Leverage capital ratio of 5.00% or greater. There are no conditions or events since that notification that Management believes have
changed the bank subsidiary s category.  
      42  

The Company s actual capital amounts and ratios and required minimum capital amounts and ratios as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
   The actual capital amounts and ratios and required minimum capital amounts and ratios for the Bank as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
   Management continues to emphasize the importance of maintaining the appropriate capital levels of the Company and has
established the goal of being  well-capitalized  by the banking regulatory authorities.     LIQUIDITY   
 Liquidity represents the Company s ability to adequately provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other commitments by either
converting assets to cash or accessing new or existing sources of funds. Management monitors these funds requirements in such a manner as to satisfy these demands and provide the maximum earnings on its earning assets. The Company manages and
monitors its liquidity position through a number of methods,  
      43  

including through the computation of liquidity risk targets and the preparation of various analyses of its funding sources and utilization of those sources on a monthly basis. The Company also
uses proforma liquidity projections which are updated on a monthly basis in the management of its liquidity needs and also conducts periodic contingency testing on its liquidity plan. 
 Deposits, payments of principal and interest on loans, proceeds from maturities of investment securities and earnings on investment securities are the
principal sources of funds for the Company. Borrowings from the FHLB, federal funds sold and federal funds purchased are utilized by the Company to manage its daily liquidity position. The Company has also been approved to participate in the Federal
Reserve Bank s Discount Window Primary Credit Program, which it intends to use only as a contingency.     REGULATORY MATTERS   
 During 2014, Management identified opportunities for improving risk management and earnings, addressing asset quality concerns, analyzing and assessing the
Bank s management and staffing needs, and managing concentrations of credit risk as a result of its own investigation as well as examinations performed by certain bank regulatory agencies. In concert with the regulators, the Company had
identified specific corrective steps and actions to enhance its risk management, earnings, asset quality and staffing. The Company and the Bank may not declare or pay any cash dividends without the prior written approval of their regulators.  
  Item 4: Controls and Procedures     As of September 30,
2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
      44  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
  Item 1: Legal Proceedings     The Bank is involved in
various legal matters and claims which are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. None of these matters is expected, in the opinion of Management, to have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.    Item 5: Other Information   
 None.     Item 6 - Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K
