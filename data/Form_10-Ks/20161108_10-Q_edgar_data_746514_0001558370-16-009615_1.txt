NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Line of Business  :  New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership ( NERA  or the  Partnership ) was organized in Massachusetts in 1977. NERA and its subsidiaries own 25 properties which include 17 residential buildings; 4 mixed use residential, retail and office buildings; 3 commercial buildings and individual units at one condominium complex. These properties total 2,506 apartment units, 19 condominium units and 108,043 square feet of commercial space. Additionally, the Partnership also owns a 40- 50% interest in 9 residential and mixed use properties consisting of 778 apartment units, 12,500 square feet of commercial space and a 50 car parking lot. The properties are located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. 

Basis of Presentation:   The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial results. Judgements and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. 

Principles of Consolidation  :  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NERA and its subsidiaries. NERA has a 99.67% to 100% ownership interest in each subsidiary except for the nine limited liability companies (the  Investment Properties  or  Joint Ventures ) in which the Partnership has a 40 - 50% ownership interest. The consolidated group is referred to as the  Partnership . Minority interests are not recorded, since they are insignificant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Partnership accounts for its investment in the above-mentioned Investment Properties using the equity method of consolidation. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures). 

The Partnership accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. In 2013 and beyond, the carrying values of investments fell below zero. We intend to fund our share of the investments  future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have no legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) 

The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the  primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the   

8 

variable interest entity s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. 

Impairment:    On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership s rental properties or investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired. In addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties, management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment. The criteria considered by management include reviewing low leased percentages, significant near term lease expirations, recently acquired properties, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, near term mortgage debt maturities or other factors that might impact the Partnership s intent and ability to hold property. A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved.  

Revenue Recognition:    Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contingent rent for commercial properties are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. 

Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values for acquired properties are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. 

Rental Properties:    Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions which improve or extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 

Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Partnership s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values   

9 

include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. 

In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. 

Leasing Fees:    Leasing fees are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease. Unamortized balances are expensed when the corresponding fee is no longer applicable. 

Deferred Financing Costs:    Costs incurred in obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. Deferred financing costs are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability to which they relate, except deferred financing costs related to the revolving credit facility, which are presented in prepaid expenses and other assets. In all cases, amortization of such costs is included in interest expense and was approximately $141,000 and $128,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Income Taxes:    The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that NERA and its subsidiaries are entitled to tax treatment as partnerships. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes have been recorded (See Note 13). 

Cash Equivalents:    The Partnership considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less. 

Segment Reporting:    Operating segments are revenue producing components of the Partnership for which separate financial information is produced internally for management. Under the definition, NERA operated, for all periods presented, as one segment. 

Comprehensive Income:    Comprehensive income is defined as changes in partners  equity, exclusive of transactions with owners (such as capital contributions and dividends). NERA did not have any comprehensive income items in 2016 or 2015 other than net income as reported. 

Income Per Depositary Receipt:    Effective January 3, 2012, the Partnership authorized a 3-for-1 forward split of its Depositary Receipts listed on the NYSE Amex and a concurrent adjustment of the exchange ratio of Depositary Receipts for Class A Units of the Partnership from 10-to-1 to 30-to-1, such that each Depositary Receipt represents one-thirtieth (  1  /  30  ) of a Class A Unit of the Partnership. All references to Depositary Receipts in the report are reflective of the 3- for-1 forward split. 

Income Per Unit:    Net income per unit has been calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during each period presented. The Partnership has no dilutive units and, therefore, basic net income is the same as diluted net income per unit (see Note 7: Partner s Capital). 

Concentration of Credit Risks and Financial Instruments:    The Partnership s properties are located in New England, and the Partnership is subject to the general economic risks related thereto. No single tenant accounted for more than 5% of the Partnership s revenues in 2016 or 2015. The Partnership makes its temporary cash investments with high-credit quality financial institutions. At September 30, 2016, substantially all of the Partnership s cash and cash equivalents were held in interest-bearing accounts at financial institutions, earning interest at rates from 0.01% to 0.35%. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively approximately $9,241,000, and $11,592,000 of cash and cash equivalents, and security deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets exceeded federally insured amounts. 

10 

Advertising Expense:    Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $154,105 and $106,482 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Discontinued Operations and Rental Property Held for Sale  :  In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. This guidance defines a discontinued operation as a component or group of components disposed or classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and final result; the guidance states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area of operations, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.  The guidance also provides for additional disclosure requirements in connection with both discontinued operations and other dispositions not qualifying as discontinued operations.  The Partnership has elected to early adopt this standard effective with the interim period beginning January 1, 2014.  Prior to January 1, 2014, properties identified as held for sale and/or disposed of were presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

Interest Capitalized:    The Partnership follows the policy of capitalizing interest as a component of the cost of rental property when the time of construction exceeds one year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there was no capitalized interest. 

Extinguishment of Debt:    When existing mortgages are refinanced with the same lender and it is determined that the refinancing is substantially different, then they are recorded as an extinguishment of debt. However if it is determined that the refinancing is substantially the same, then they are recorded as an exchange of debt. All refinancing qualify as extinguishment of debt. 

Reclassifications:    Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform to current period presentation. The reclassifications were related primarily to conform to ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the     Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. This new standard was effective for interim and annual reporting beginning after December 15, 2015 and requires retrospective application. Approximately $1.4 million of deferred financing costs were reclassified to contra term loans on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015. There was no change to the net income for any period presented as a result of these reclassifications. 

NOTE 2. RENTAL PROPERTIES 

As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships owned 2,506 residential apartment units in 21 residential and mixed-use complexes (collectively, the  Apartment Complexes ). The Partnership also owns 19 condominium units in a residential condominium complex, all of which are leased to residential tenants (collectively referred to as the  Condominium Units ). The Apartment Complexes and Condominium Units are located primarily in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts. 

Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, the Partnership and Subsidiary Partnerships owned a commercial shopping center in Framingham, commercial buildings in Newton and Brookline and mixed-use properties in Boston, Brockton and Newton, all in Massachusetts. These properties are referred to collectively as the  Commercial Properties.  

The Partnership also owned a 40% to 50% ownership interest in nine residential and mixed use complexes (the  Investment Properties ) at September 30, 2016 with a total of 778 units, accounted for using the equity method of consolidation. See Note 14 for summary information on these investments. 

On August 3, 2016, Hamilton Green Apartments, LLC sold a single family house contiguous with its apartment complex in Andover, Massachusetts.  The sale price of the property was $1,000,000 with closing costs of $227,663 and a cost basis of $668,544 resulting in a gain on the sale of $103,793.  Included in the closing costs is a mortgage prepayment penalty of $187,905.  The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the principal amount on the apartment complex s mortgage. 

On September 18, 2015,  R  esidences at Captain Parker, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company   ( Captain Parker ) a newly formed subsidiary of the Partnership, purchased the Residence at Captain Parkers, a 94 unit apartment complex located at 125 Worthen Road and Ryder Lane in Lexington, Massachusetts. The purchase price was   

11 

$31,600,000 and the closing costs were approximately $49,000. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $474,000 for in-place leases, and approximately $31,000 to the value of tenant relationships. These amounts are being amortized over 12 and 24 months respectively. To fund the purchase, the Partnership utilized the available line of credit of $25,000,000, and the balance from the Partnership s cash reserves.   

Rental properties consist of the following: 

NOTE 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Partnership s properties are managed by an entity that is owned by the majority shareholder of the General Partner. The management fee is equal to 4% of gross receipts rental revenue and laundry income on the majority of the Partnership s properties and 3% on Linewt. Total fees paid were approximately $1,513,000 and $1,370,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner or Management Company to charge the costs of professional services (such as counsel, accountants and contractors) to NERA.

On March 22, 2010, the General Partner re-authorized and renewed the Repurchase Program that expired on August 19, 2009. Under the terms of the renewed Repurchase Program, the Partnership may purchase up to 1,500,000 Depositary Receipts from the start of the program in 2007 through March 31, 2015. On March 10, 2015, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 Depository Receipts and extended the Program for an additional five years from March 31, 2015 until March 31, 2020. The Repurchase Program requires the Partnership to repurchase a proportionate number of Class B Units and General Partner Units in connection with any repurchases of any Depositary Receipts by the Partnership based upon the 80%, 19% and 1% fixed distribution percentages of the holders of the Class A, Class B and General Partner Units under the Partnership s Second Amended and Restate Contract of Limited Partnership. Repurchases of Depositary Receipts or Partnership Units pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made by the Partnership from time to time in its sole discretion in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. From August 20, 2007 through September 30, 2016, the Partnership has repurchased 1,352,427 Depositary Receipts at an average price of $26.81 per receipt (or $804.30 per underlying Class A

The majority of these leases expire in June, July and August. Approximately 7% was related to commercial properties, which have minimum future annual rental income on non-cancellable operating leases at September 30, 2016 as follows:

Rents receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $666,000 and $373,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Included in rents receivable at September 30, 2016 is approximately $115,000 resulting from recognizing rental income from non-cancelable commercial leases with future rental increases on a straight-line basis. The majority of this amount is for long-term leases at 62 Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts. 

Rents receivable at September 30, 2016 also includes approximately $111,000 representing the deferral of rental concession primarily related to the residential properties. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 rent at the commercial properties includes approximately $2,000 of amortization of deferred rents arising from the fair values assigned to in-place leases upon the purchase of Cypress Street in Brookline, Massachusetts. 

NOTE 11. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we do not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements. 

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and note payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or, the recent acquisition of these items. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we estimated the fair value of our mortgages payable and other notes based upon quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimated the fair value of our secured mortgage debt that does not have current quoted market prices available by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 3). The differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value are the result of differences in interest rates and/or borrowing spreads that were available to us at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or acquired. The secured mortgage debt contain pre-payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so. 

17 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Partnership in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: 

For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, investment in partnerships, accounts payable, advance rents and security deposits: fair value approximates the carrying value of such assets and liabilities.     

For mortgage notes payable: fair value is generally based on estimated future cash flows, which are discounted using the quoted market rate from an independent source for similar obligations. Refer to the table below for the carrying amount and estimated fair value of such instruments.     

The following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of our debt. 

* Net of unamortized deferred financing costs 

Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2016 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 

NOTE 13. TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX BASIS 

Taxable income reportable by the Partnership and includable in its partners  tax returns is different than financial statement income because of tax free exchanges, accelerated depreciation, different tax lives, and timing differences related to prepaid rents, allowances and intangible assets at significant acquisitions. Taxable income of approximately $2,106,000 was approximately $1,667,000 less than statement income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary reason for the difference is due to accelerated depreciation, tax free exchange and other differences in the treatment of certain expenditures. The cumulative tax basis of the Partnership s real estate at December 31, 2015 is approximately $7,000,000 less than the statement basis. The primary reasons for the lower tax basis are tax free exchanges, and accelerated depreciation. The Partnership s tax basis in its joint venture investments is approximately $1,500,000 less than statement basis because of accelerated depreciation. Taxable income for 2016 is expected to exceed financial statement income, primarily due to a change in taxable depreciation expense. 

Certain entities included in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state taxes. These taxes are not significant and are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidates financial statements. 

While allowable accelerated tax depreciation deductions were extended, future tax law changes may significantly affect taxable income. 

The Partnership adopted the amended provisions related to uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. As a result of the implementation of the guidance, the Partnership recognized no material adjustment regarding its tax accounting treatment. The Partnership expects to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense, which would be included in general and administrative expense. 

18 

In the normal course of business the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions in which it operates, where applicable. As of September 30, 2016, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations are from the year 2012 forward.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, modifying the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.  This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.  A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for in the same manner as operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The guidance supersedes previously issued guidance under ASC Topic 840  Leases . The guidance is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Partnership is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates a requirement for the retroactive adjustment on a step by step basis of the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings as if the equity method had been effective during all previous periods that the investment had been held when an investment qualifies for equity method accounting due to an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee is to be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method of accounting should be adopted as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. This guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 will have no significant impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues and intends to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Partnership is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Partnership s consolidated statement of cash flows. 

NOTE 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

From October 1, 2016 through November 4, 2016, the Partnership purchased a total of 330 Depositary Receipts. The average price was $60.13 per receipt or $1,803.90 per unit. The total cost was $20,605. The Partnership is required to repurchase 2.6 Class B Units and 0.1 General Partnership Units at a cost of $4,713 and $248 respectively. 

On October 26, 2016, the Partnership announced that on December 31, 2016 it will make its regular quarterly distribution and a special distribution to its owners of record as of December 15, 2016. The quarterly distribution will be $7.50 per unit. The quarterly distribution per Depository Receipt will be $0.25. The special distribution will be $24 per unit. The special distribution per Depository Receipt will be $0.80.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Forward Looking Statements 

Certain information contained herein includes forward looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Liquidation Reform Act of 1995 (the  Act ). Forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in written form from time to time, reflect management s good faith belief when those statements are made, and are based on information currently available to management. Caution should be exercised in interpreting and relying on such forward looking statements, the realization of which may be impacted by known and unknown risks and uncertainties, events that may occur subsequent to the forward looking statements, and other factors which may be beyond the Partnership s control and which can materially affect the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements for 2016 and beyond. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties mentioned below materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. 

Since the Partnership s long-term goals include the acquisition of additional properties, a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose.  If available acquisitions do not meet the Partnership s investment criteria, the Partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts.  The Partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the Partnership s cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the Partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions. 

The third quarter performance is consistent with Management s expectations as noted in the second quarter  Form10-Q.  While consolidated year to date revenue growth for the third quarter was 10.4%, same store revenue growth was 5.2%.  Similarly, Net Operating Income ( Income Before Other Income (Expense) plus Depreciation and Amortization) grew by 12.0% and 5.8% respectively.  Revenue gains were across the board, and tenant retention remains high. The portfolio mix of student and working class housing continues to outperform higher end properties in terms of revenue gains and occupancy.  Management expects similar year to date gains to reveal themselves in the upcoming fourth quarter and entire first half of 2017. This is largely due to the recent renewal and new lease rental increases during the third quarter. We believe that consolidated operating expenses reflect normalized operations in contrast to the extreme weather conditions of the 2014-2015 winter which blurred the Partnership s traditional ongoing operating ratios. We believe that our previous emphasis on curb appeal has contributed to the overall performance of the portfolio and upon further review we may consider decelerating allocations toward capital expenditures for 2017. 

The General Partner recently announced a Board of Advisor approved fourth quarter distribution and special distribution payable to all owners of record as of December 15, 2016, and payable December 31,     2016. The 4  th   quarter distribution will be approximately $1,000,000 in total, and the special distribution will be approximately $3,000,000 in total. We expect taxable income to exceed financial statement income for 2016. 

Management has also begun to market the remaining condominiums at Hamilton Bay Apartments, LLC and Hamilton 1025, LLC, (Joint Venture). Management expects a complete sellout over the next two years as the residential leases mature. It is expected that the unit sale prices will exceed previous unit sales when the buildings were converted 10 years ago. Hamilton 1025, LLC  sold six units in the third quarter  resulting in  gains on sales of approximately $802,000. 

The Partnership purchased a 94 unit apartment complex in Lexington, Residences at Captain Parkers, for $31.6 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Management s expectations on revenue, operating expenses and returns on capital improvements made in the fourth quarter of 2015 are being met and the property will be contributing to the Partnership s cash flow as anticipated. 

The Stock Repurchase Program that was initiated in 2007 has purchased 1,352,427 Depositary Receipts through September 30, 2016 or approximately 32% of the outstanding Class A Depositary Receipts.  During the third quarter, the Partnership did not purchase any Depositary Receipts. 

29 

At November 1, 2016, Harold Brown, his brother Ronald Brown and the President of Hamilton, Carl Valeri, collectively own approximately 42% of the Depositary Receipts representing the Partnership Class A Units (including Depositary Receipts held by trusts for the benefit of such persons  family members). Harold Brown also controls 75% of the Partnership s Class B Units, 75% of the capital stock of NewReal, Inc. ( NewReal ), the Partnership s sole general partner, and all of the outstanding stock of Hamilton. Ronald Brown also owns 25% of the Partnership s Class B Units and 25% of NewReal s capital stock. In addition, Ronald Brown is the President and director of NewReal and Harold Brown is NewReal s Treasurer and a director. The 75% of the issued and outstanding Class B units of the Partnership, controlled by Harold Brown, are owned by HBC Holdings LLC, an entity of which he is the manager. 

In addition to the Management Fee, the Partnership Agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the Partnership and allows NewReal to charge the Partnership for the cost of employing professionals to assist with the administration of the Partnership s properties. Additionally, from time to time, the Partnership pays Hamilton for repairs and maintenance services, legal services, construction services and accounting services. The costs charged by Hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by Hamilton, and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace. 

Residential tenants sign a one year lease. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, tenant renewals were approximately 63% with an average rental increase of approximately 4.9%, new leases accounted for approximately 37% with rental rate increases of approximately 5.8%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, leasing commissions were approximately $328,000 compared to approximately $226,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $102,000 (45.2%) from 2015. Tenant concessions were approximately $43,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $79,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $36,000 (45.6%).  Tenant improvements were approximately $1,603,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $2,383,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $780,000 (32.7%). 

Hamilton accounted for approximately 4.6% of the repair and maintenance expenses paid for by the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 6.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Of the funds paid to Hamilton for this purpose, the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the Hamilton maintenance department, including plumbing, electrical, carpentry services, and snow removal for those properties close to Hamilton s headquarters. Several of the larger Partnership properties have their own maintenance staff. Those properties that do not have their own maintenance staff and are located more than a reasonable distance from Hamilton s headquarters in Allston, Massachusetts are generally serviced by local, independent companies. 

Hamilton s legal department handles most of the Partnership s eviction and collection matters. Additionally, it prepares most long-term commercial lease agreements and represents the Partnership in selected purchase and sale transactions. Overall, Hamilton provided approximately $167,000 (86.1%) and approximately $164,000 (75.8%) of the legal services paid for by the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, The Hamilton Company receives similar fees from the Investment Properties. 

The Partnership requires that three bids be obtained for construction contracts in excess of $15,000. Hamilton may be one of the three bidders on a particular project and may be awarded the contract if its bid and its ability to successfully complete the project are deemed appropriate. For contracts that are not awarded to Hamilton, Hamilton charges the Partnership a construction supervision fee equal to 5% of the contract amount. Hamilton s architectural department also provides services to the Partnership on an as-needed basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Hamilton provided the Partnership approximately $158,000 in construction and architectural services, compared to approximately $126,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Hamilton s accounting staff perform bookkeeping and accounting functions for the Partnership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Hamilton charged the Partnership $93,750 for bookkeeping and accounting services. For more information on related party transactions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Principles of Consolidation. 

Revenue Recognition:    Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Concessions made on residential leases are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. 

Discontinued Operations and Rental Property Held for Sale:    In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. This guidance defines a discontinued operation as a component or group of components disposed or classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and final result; the guidance states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area of operations, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.  The guidance also provides for additional disclosure requirements in connection with both discontinued operations and other dispositions not qualifying as discontinued operations. The Partnership has elected to early adopt this standard effective with the interim period beginning January 1, 2014.  Prior to January 1, 2014, properties identified as held for sale and/or disposed of were presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

Rental Properties:    Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 

Intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values above and below market leases and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Partnership s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth   

31 

prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. 

In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. 

Impairment:    On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership s rental properties may be impaired. A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved. The Partnership has not recognized an impairment loss during the first nine months of 2016. 

Investments in Joint Ventures:    The Partnership accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. In 2013 and beyond, the carrying value of investments fell below zero. We intend to fund our share of the investments  future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have no legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) 

The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the  primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. 

With respect to investments in and advances to the Investment Properties, the Partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge is recorded if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. 

Legal Proceedings:    The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it is determined that a loss is likely to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 

The Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships earned income before interest expense, income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, gain on sale of real estate and other income and expense of approximately $3,098,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $3,378,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $280,000 (8.3%). 

The rental activity is summarized as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015: 

33 

Rental income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $12,274,000, compared to approximately $11,116,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $1,157,000 (10.4 %). The factors that can be attributed to this increase are as follows: the acquisition of Captain Parker resulted in an increase in rental income of approximately $524,000. In addition, rental income has increased at a number of properties due to increased demand and increases in rental rates. The Partnership Properties with the most significant increases in rental income include, Westgate Apartments, 1144 Commonwealth Avenue, 62 Boylston Street ,Westside Colonial, School Street,  Executive Apartments, and Hamilton Oaks, with increases of approximately $116,000, $73,000, $65,000, $64,000, $56,000, $51,000 and $46,000 respectively. Included in rental income is contingent rentals collected on commercial properties. Contingent rentals include such charges as bill backs of common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and utility charges. 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $9,274,000 compared to approximately $7,832,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $1,442,000 (18.4%). The operating expenses associated with the acquisition of Captain Parker were approximately $656,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Excluding Captain Parker, operating expenses increased approximately $888,000 (11.5%). The factors contributing to this net increase are an increase in repairs and maintenance costs of approximately $ 282,000 (14.1%) due to continued maintenance at the properties, an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $103,000 (4.1%), an increase in operating expenses of approximately $172,000 (21.5%), and an increase in taxes and insurance of  approximately $179,000 (14.3%). 

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,554,000 compared to approximately $2,477,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $77,000 (3.1%).  Approximately $133,000 of this increase represents the interest on the mortgage on Captain Parker, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the Line of Credit of approximately $43,000. 

At September 30, 2016, the Partnership has between a 40% and 50% ownership interests in nine different Investment Properties. See a description of these properties included in the section titled Investment Properties as well as Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail of the financial information of each Investment Property. 

As described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Partnership s share of the net income  from the Investment Properties was approximately $563,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of approximately $178,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,  an increase in income of approximately $385,000 (216.3%). This increase is primarily due to  a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately $902,000 on the sale of 6 units at Hamilton 1025 and 1 unit at Hamilton Bay LLC for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a gain of approximately $77,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by an increase in renting expense of approximately $118,000 and an increase in Repairs and Maintenance expense of approximately $127,000. Included in the income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $1,491,000. The proportional income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the investment in Dexter Park is approximately $61,000. 

As a result of the changes discussed above, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1,211,000 compared to income of approximately $1,074,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in income of approximately $137,000 (12.8 %).

The operating expenses associated with the acquisition of Captain Parker were approximately $2,053,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Excluding Captain Parker, operating expenses increased approximately $1,119,000 (4.7%). The factors contributing to this net increase are an increase in repairs and maintenance costs of approximately $793,000 (15.3%), due to continued maintenance at the properties, an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $356,000 (4.8%), and an increase in taxes and insurance of approximately $313,000 (7.5%), partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $ 465,000 (12.2%) due to a decrease in snow removal costs. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $7,650,000 compared to approximately $7,300,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $350,000   

35 

(4.8%).  Approximately $382,000 of this increase represents the interest on the mortgage on Captain Parker, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the Line of Credit of approximately $25,000. 

At September 30, 2016, the Partnership has between a 40% and 50% ownership interests in nine different Investment Properties. See a description of these properties included in the section titled Investment Properties as well as Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail of the financial information of each Investment Property.

This increase is primarily due to an increase in rental revenue of approximately $494,000, and a net gain of approximately $1,137,000 on the sale of 6 units at Hamilton 1025 and 4 units at Hamilton Bay LLC for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared  to a gain of approximately $77,000 for the nine  months ended September 30,2015, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $437,000. Included in the income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $4,445,000. The proportional income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the investment in Dexter Park is approximately $525,000. 

As a result of the changes discussed above, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3,422,000 compared to income of approximately $2,580,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in income of approximately $842,000 (32.6 %). 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Partnership s principal source of cash during the first nine months of 2016 was the collection of rents and the proceeds from the mortgage for Captain Parker. The Partnership s principal source of cash in 2015 was the collection of rents. The majority of cash and cash equivalents of $7,873,583 at September 30, 2016 and $10,298,186 at December 31, 2015 were held in interest bearing accounts at creditworthy financial institutions. 

The decrease in cash of $2,424,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized as follows: 

The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in rent collections and a decrease in cash operating expenses. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is due primarily to no purchases of rental properties in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The change in cash used in financing activities is due to the paydown of the $25,000,000 outstanding line of credit, partially offset by the proceeds of the mortgage on Captain Parker, and the payment of mortgage notes payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership purchased 10,829 Depositary Receipts for an average price of $50.11 for a total cost of $558,723; 86 Class B Units for a cost of $128,874 and 5 General Partnership Units for a cost of $6,783, for a total cost of $694,380. 

During 2016, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships have completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately $3,564,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves. Cash reserves have been adequate to fully fund improvements. The most significant improvements were made at Captain Parker, Hamilton Oaks, 62 Boylston Street, Westside Colonial, 1144 Commonwealth, and North Beacon Street,  at a cost of approximately $637,000, $479,000, $439,000, $345,000, $216,000 and $203,000 respectively. The Partnership plans to invest approximately $500,000 in additional capital improvements in 2016. 

On January 7, 2016, Captain Parker entered into a Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with K  eyBank National Association   (the  Lender ). The manager of Captain Parker is NewReal, Inc.   

36 

( New Real ), the general partner of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the  Partnership ).  The Partnership is the sole member of Captain Parker. The Loan Agreement provides for a term loan (the  Loan ) in the principal amount of $20,071,000.  The Loan is due on February 1, 2026 (the  Due Date ), unless the due date is accelerated in accordance with the Loan s terms.  The proceeds of the Loan were used to refinance existing indebtedness. The Partnership is a limited guarantor of certain of the Captain Parker obligations under the Loan Agreement. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Partnership received distributions of approximately $2,707,000 from the investment properties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership received distributions of approximately $2,949,000 from the investment properties. Included in these distributions is the amount from Dexter Park of approximately $740,000 and $1,070,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 

The Partnership anticipates that cash from operations and interest bearing accounts will be sufficient to fund its current operations, pay distributions, make required debt payments and finance current improvements to its properties. The Partnership may also sell or refinance properties. The Partnership s net income and cash flow may fluctuate dramatically from year to year as a result of the sale or refinancing of properties, increases or decreases in rental income or expenses, or the loss of significant tenants. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness 

As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership had a 40%-50% ownership interest in nine Joint Ventures, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We do not have control of these partnerships and therefore we account for them using the equity method of consolidation. At September 30, 2016, our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt related to these investments was approximately $56,907,000. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Contractual Obligations 

See Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage notes payable. The Partnerships has no other material contractual obligations to be disclosed. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results 

Along with risks detailed in Item 1A and from time to time in the Partnership s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some factors that could cause the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following: 

The Partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located, primarily in Eastern Massachusetts, and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions, which are beyond the Partnership s control.     

The Partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry, such as dependence on tenants  financial condition, the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants.     

The Partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the Partnership s tenants, such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the Greater Boston metropolitan area.     

The Partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property.     

The Partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions.     

37 

Civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses.     

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.     

Financing or refinancing of Partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable, or may not be available on favorable terms.     

The Partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect the Partnership s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged.     

Given the nature of the real estate business, the Partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities. These include environmental contamination in the soil at the Partnership s or neighboring real estate, whether caused by the Partnership, previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property, and the presence of hazardous materials in the Partnership s buildings, such as asbestos, lead, mold and radon gas. Management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time.     

Insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain. In addition, insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies, which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the Partnership. These include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war, and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions. Coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive.     

Market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for Class A Partnership Units and Depositary Receipts as well as performance and cash flow.     

Changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the Partnership. These changes may affect the after-tax value of future distributions.     

The Partnership may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital; may be unable to sell poorly- performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties.     

Risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments.     

Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.     

Any weakness identified in the Partnership s internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the Partnership s business.     

Ongoing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes.     

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said Act. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices.  In pursuing its business plan, the primary market risk to which the Partnership is exposed is interest rate risk.  Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Partnership s yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors. 

38 

As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have approximately $343,641,000 in long-term debt, substantially all of which require payment of interest at fixed rates. Accordingly, the fair value of these debt instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. This long term debt matures through 2029. The Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have variable rate debt of $30,071,000 (without taking out unamortized deferred financing costs) as of September 30, 2016 ranged from LIBOR plus 201 basis points to LIBOR plus 350 basis points. Assuming interest- rate caps are not in effect, if market rates of interest on the Partnership s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Partnership s variable rate debt would be approximately $251,000 annually and the increase or decrease in the fair value of the Partnership s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2016 would be approximately $18 million. For information regarding the fair value and maturity dates of these debt obligations,  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements    Mortgage Notes Payable,  Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements    Fair Value Measurements  and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements    Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  

For additional disclosure about market risk, see  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors That May Affect Future Results . 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    The Partnership s management, with the participation of the Partnership s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, the Partnership s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
