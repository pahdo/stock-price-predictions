 Significant Accounting Policies     

 Organization    
 Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the  Corporation  or  Martin Marietta ) is engaged principally in the construction aggregates business. The aggregates product line accounted for 54% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (55% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales) and includes crushed stone, sand and gravel, and is used for construction of highways and other infrastructure projects, and in the nonresidential and residential construction industries. Aggregates products are also used in the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. The Corporation s aggregates-related downstream product lines, which accounted for 32% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (27% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales) include asphalt products, ready mixed concrete and road paving construction services.  Aggregates and aggregates-related downstream product lines are sold and shipped from a network of more than 400 quarries, distribution facilities and plants in 26 states, Nova Scotia and the Bahamas. The aggregates and aggregates-related downstream product lines are reported collectively as the  Aggregates business .  
 The Corporation currently conducts the Aggregates business through three reportable segments: the Mid-America Group, the Southeast Group and the West Group.

The Corporation has a Cement segment, which accounted for 7% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (11% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales which included the operations of a California-based cement plant sold in September 2015).  The Cement segment has production facilities located in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas-Fort Worth and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio, which produce Portland and specialty cements. Similar to the Aggregates business, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. The high calcium limestone reserves, used as a raw material, are owned by the Cement business and are adjacent to each of the plants.  
 The Corporation has a Magnesia Specialties segment with manufacturing facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio. The Magnesia Specialties segment, which accounted for 7% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (7% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales), produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry.

 Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The Corporation has continued to follow the accounting policies set forth in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the interim consolidated financial information provided herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods. The consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results expected for other interim periods or the full year. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ),   which amends the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements.  The ASU requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, and does not impact the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. The Corporation adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and has retrospectively adjusted the prior periods presented, resulting in a reclassification of $3,567,000 and $3,848,000 from  Other noncurrent assets  to  Long-term debt  as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and $533,000 from  Other current assets  to  Current maturities of long-term debt and short-term maturities  as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.   
 Revenue Recognition Standard  
 The FASB issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The new standard intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability of revenue recognition practices and improve disclosure requirements. The new standard is effective January 1, 2018 and can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The Corporation will not early adopt this standard.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact the provisions of the new standard will have on its financial statements and expects to complete its evaluation by the end of 2016.

 Lease Standard 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard,  Accounting Standards Update 2016-2   Leases,  intending   to improve financial reporting of leases and to provide more transparency into off-balance sheet leasing obligations.  The guidance requires virtually all leases, excluding mineral interest leases, to be recorded on the balance sheet and provides guidance on the recognition of lease expense and income.  The new standard is effective January 1, 2019 and must be applied on a modified retrospective approach.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its financial statements. 
 Share-based Payment Standard 
     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies certain aspects of accounting guidance and requirements for share-based transactions.  The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017.  The Corporation is evaluating the impact of the ASU on its financial statements.   
 Consolidated Comprehensive Earnings/Loss and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  
 Consolidated comprehensive earnings/loss for the Corporation consist of consolidated net earnings or loss; adjustments for the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans; foreign currency translation adjustments; and the amortization of the value of terminated forward starting interest rate swap agreements into interest expense, and are presented in the Corporation s consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings.  
 Comprehensive earnings attributable to Martin Marietta is as follows:

 Earnings per Common Share  
 The numerator for basic and diluted earnings per common share is net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. reduced by dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to certain of the Corporation s stock-based compensation. If there is a net loss, no amount of the undistributed loss is attributed to unvested participating securities. The denominator for basic earnings per common share is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed assuming that the weighted-average number of common shares is increased by the conversion, using the treasury stock method, of awards to be issued to employees and nonemployee members of the Corporation s Board of Directors under certain stock-based compensation arrangements if the conversion is dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the diluted per-share computations reflect a change in the number of common shares outstanding to include the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.  
   
 The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator for basic and diluted earnings per common share:  

The following table shows the changes in goodwill by reportable segment and in total:

      Long-Term Debt (continued)     

 On September 28, 2016, t he Corporation, through a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, amended its trade receivable securitization facility (the  Trade Receivable Facility ) to increase the borrowing capacity from $250,000,000 to $300,000,000 and extend the maturity to September 27, 2017.  The Trade Receivable Facility, with SunTrust Bank, Regions Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD., New York Branch, and certain other lenders that may become a party to the facility from time to time, is backed by eligible trade receivables, as defined.  Borrowings are limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined, of $420,044,000, $282,258,000 and $425,733,000 at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  These receivables are originated by the Corporation and then sold or contributed to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary by the Corporation.    The Corporation con  tinues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by   the wholly-owned special-purpose  subsidiary .  Borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility bear interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.725%  , subject to change in the event that this rate no longer reflects the lender s cost of lending  .   The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Corporation s other debt agreements.  
 The Corporation s Credit Agreement, which provides a $250,000,000 (original amount) senior unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan Facility ) and a $350,000,000 five-year senior unsecured revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ), requires the Corporation s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ( EBITDA ), as defined by the Credit Agreement, for the trailing-twelve months (the  Ratio ) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Corporation may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions for a period of 180 days so long as the Corporation, as a consequence of such specified acquisition, does not have its rating on long-term unsecured debt fall below BBB by Standard   Poor s or Baa2 by Moody s and the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if no amounts are outstanding under both the Revolving Facility and the Trade Receivable Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower, may be reduced by the Corporation s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50,000,000, such reduction not to exceed $200,000,000, for purposes of the covenant calculation. 
 In accordance with the amended Credit Agreement, the Corporation adjusted consolidated EBITDA to add back any integration or similar costs or expenses related to the TXI business combination incurred in any period prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the TXI business combination, not to exceed $70,000,000. The Corporation was in compliance with the Ratio at September 30, 2016.  
 Available borrowings under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued by the Corporation under the Revolving Facility. At September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, the Corporation had $2,507,000 of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility.  
 Current debt maturities consist of borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility and the current portions of the Term Loan Facility and other notes.  The Floating Rate Notes have been classified as a noncurrent liability as the Corporation has the intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis before or at its maturity of June 30, 2017. 
 Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the unamortized value of terminated forward starting interest rate swap agreements. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized $344,000 and $1,016,000, respectively, as additional interest expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Corporation recognized $318,000 and $942,000, respectively, as additional interest expense. The ongoing amortization of the terminated value of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements will increase annual interest expense by approximately $1,400,000 until the maturity of the 6.6% Senior Notes in 2018.

      Financial Instruments      

 The Corporation s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, bank overdraft, accounts payable, publicly-registered long-term notes, debentures and other long-term debt.  
 Cash equivalents are placed primarily in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts and Eurodollar time deposits. The Corporation s cash equivalents have original maturities of less than three months. Due to the short maturity of these investments, they are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value.  
 Accounts receivable are due from a large number of customers, primarily in the construction industry, and are dispersed across wide geographic and economic regions. However, accounts receivable are more heavily concentrated in certain states (namely, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia). The estimated fair values of accounts receivable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of the receivables.  
 Notes receivable are classified in the line items  Other current assets  and  Other noncurrent assets  on the consolidated balance sheets and are not publicly traded. Management estimates that the fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying amount due to the variable interest rates of the receivables. 
 The bank overdraft represents amounts to be funded to financial institutions for checks that have cleared the bank. The estimated fair value of the bank overdraft approximates its carrying value due to the short-term nature of the overdraft. 
 Accounts payable represent amounts owed to suppliers and vendors. The estimated fair value of accounts payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short-term nature of the payables.  
 The carrying values and fair values of the Corporation s long-term debt were $1,764,835,000 and $1,876,802,000, respectively, at September 30, 2016; $1,568,774,000 and $1,625,193,000, respectively, at December 31, 2015; and $1,700,771,000 and $1,781,152,000, respectively, at September 30, 2015. The estimated fair value of the publicly-registered long-term notes was estimated based on Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of other borrowings, which primarily represents variable-rate debt, was based on Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices for similar debt instruments, and approximates their carrying amounts as the interest rates reset periodically.   

6.   
 
 Income Taxes     

 The Corporation s effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 30.6% and 29.4%, respectively.  The estimated effective income tax rates reflect the effect of federal and state income taxes and the impact of differences in book and tax accounting arising from the net permanent benefits associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves and the domestic production deduction.   
 The Corporation records interest accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings.

      Commitments and Contingencies      

  Legal and Administrative Proceedings   
 The Corporation is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the opinion of management and counsel, based upon currently-available facts, it is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation and other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters, relating to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the Corporation s operations, its cash flows or its financial position.  
  Borrowing Arrangements with Affiliate   
 The Corporation is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit agreement with BB T Bank. The affiliate has agreed to reimburse and indemnify the Corporation for any payments and expenses the Corporation may incur from this agreement. The Corporation holds a lien on the affiliate s membership interest in a joint venture as collateral for payment under the revolving line of credit.  
 In addition, the Corporation has a $6,000,000 outstanding loan due from this unconsolidated affiliate as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.  
  Employees  
 Approximately 10% of the Corporation s employees are represented by a labor union.  All such employees are hourly employees.  The Corporation maintains collective bargaining agreements relating to the union employees with the Aggregates business and Magnesia Specialties segments.  For the Magnesia Specialties segment located in Manistee, Michigan and Woodville, Ohio, 100% of its hourly employees are represented by labor unions.

      Business Segments (continued)     

 The decline in the Cement business s total and net sales is primarily attributable to the California cement operations, included in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and divested as of September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, total revenues, net sales and loss from operations for the California cement operations were $31,866,000, $30,781,000 and $28,947,000, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, total revenues, net sales and loss from operations for the California cement operations were $101,541,000, $98,048,000 and $36,853,000, respectively.  The California cement operations  loss from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the loss on the divestiture of $28,709,000 and $29,888,000, respectively. 
 Cement intersegment sales, which are to the aggregates and ready mixed concrete product lines in the West Group, were $34,654,000 and $89,291,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $25,349,000 and $64,304,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   
 The Aggregates business includes the aggregates product line and aggregates-related downstream product lines, which include asphalt and road paving products and ready mixed concrete. All aggregates-related downstream product lines reside in the West Group. The following tables, which are reconciled to consolidated amounts, provide net sales and gross profit by line of business: Aggregates (further divided by product line), Cement and Magnesia Specialties. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, gross profit for the California cement operations was $3,332,000.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the operations  gross profit was $2,685,000.

    11.  Business Combinations  
 In the first quarter 2016, the Corporation acquired the outstanding stock of Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, Inc., and Rocky Mountain Premix Inc.  The acquisition provides more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expands the Corporation s presence along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to 80% of Colorado s population.  The acquired operations are reported through the West Group.  The Corporation has recorded preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, certain amounts are subject to change as additional reviews are performed, including asset and liability verification and review of seller s final tax return.  Specific accounts subject to ongoing purchase accounting include property, plant and equipment; goodwill; accrued expenses and deferred income taxes.     
 During the third quarter 2016, the Corporation acquired the remaining interest in Ratliff Ready-Mix, L.P. ( Ratliff ), which operates ready mixed concrete plants in central Texas.  Prior to the acquisition, the Corporation owned a 40% interest in Ratliff which was accounted for under the equity method.  The Corporation was required to re-measure the existing 40% interest to fair value upon closing of the transaction, resulting in a gain of $5,863,000, which is recorded in other nonoperating income.  These operations are reported in the West Group.  The Corporation has recorded preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed; however, certain amounts are subject to change as further reviews are performed, including review of the seller s final tax return.  Specific accounts subject to ongoing purchase accounting include accounts receivable; property, plant and equipment; intangible assets, including goodwill; accounts payable; accrued expenses; and deferred income taxes.   
 The impact of these acquisitions on the operating results was not considered material; therefore, pro forma financial information is not included. 
 12. Stock-Based Compensation 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Corporation awarded its annual grant of stock-based compensation, which included 75,421 of performance stock units and 68,720 of restricted stock units.  The grant-date fair value of each award is $142.02 for the performance stock units and $124.41 for the restricted stock units.  No stock options are expected to be awarded in 2016.  In past years, annual stock-based compensation awards were primarily made in the second quarter of the year.  The change in the composition of the awards and the timing of the annual grant resulted in higher expense recorded in the first nine months of the year compared with prior years.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock-based compensation expense was $17,167,000 and $10,722,000, respectively.

 OVERVIEW  
 Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the  Corporation  or  Martin Marietta ) is a leading supplier of aggregates products (crushed stone, sand and gravel) and heavy building materials for the construction industry, including infrastructure, nonresidential, residential, railroad ballast, agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications. The Corporation s annual consolidated net sales and operating earnings are predominately derived from its Aggregates business, which mines, processes and sells granite, limestone, sand, gravel and other aggregates-related downstream products, including ready mixed concrete, asphalt and road paving construction services for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure, environmental industries, nonresidential and residential construction industries, as well as agriculture, railroad ballast, chemical, utility and other uses. The Aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt products from a network of more than 400 quarries, underground mines, distribution facilities and plants in 26 states, Nova Scotia and the Bahamas. The Aggregates business  products are used primarily by commercial customers principally in domestic construction of highways and other infrastructure projects and for nonresidential and residential building development. Aggregates products are also used in the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries.  
 The Corporation currently conducts its Aggregates business through three reportable business segments: Mid-America Group, Southeast Group and West Group.

    The Cement business produces Portland and specialty cements. Similar to the Aggregates business, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. T  he production facilities are located in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas-Fort Worth and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio. Limestone reserves used as a raw material are owned by the Corporation and located on property adjacent to each of the plants. In   addition to the manufacturing facilities, the Corporation operates cement distribution terminals.    
 The Corporation also has a Magnesia Specialties segment that produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry.  
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 The Corporation outlined its critical accounting policies in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no changes to the Corporation s critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Except as indicated, the comparative analysis in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on net sales and cost of sales. Gross margin and operating margin calculated as percentages of total revenues represent the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). However, gross margin as a percentage of net sales and operating margin as a percentage of net sales represent non-GAAP measures. The Corporation presents these ratios calculated based on net sales, as it is consistent with the basis by which management reviews the Corporation s operating results. Further, management believes it is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze the Corporation s operating results given that freight and delivery revenues and costs represent pass-throughs and have no profit mark-up. The following tables present the calculations of gross margin and operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of the ratios as percentages of total revenues to percentages of net sales.

 Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure market comprised 42% of quarterly volumes and decreased 7.2%.  Infrastructure shipments in the third quarter were impacted by significant rainfall and project start-up delays, primarily in Texas, which deferred shipments and led to reduced public-sector volumes.  
 The nonresidential market represented 31% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and declined 4.3%.  The Mid-America Group achieved a 5.0% increase, driven by growth in office, retail and industrial development in North Carolina and South Carolina.  The Southeast Group and West Group each experienced a decline in nonresidential activity, primarily related to weather deferrals and further reductions in energy demand.

    The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments. Volumes to this segment increased 3.0%, due to the continued housing recovery.  While the pace of housing permit growth has slowed, D  allas, Atlanta and Denver all continue to rank in the top ten in the country.  In fact, the increase in housing permits in Dallas for the trailing-twelve months led the nation.  ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 9% of aggregates product line   volumes. The volume decline in this segment principally reflects reduced ballast shipments driven by reduced energy demand, which impacts transportation and results in lower capital and maintenance activity by railroads.    
 Overall, aggregates product line shipments decreased 4.7%, reflecting various department of transportation delays, weather-driven impacts in addition to reduced energy-related shipments and lower ballast demand.   
 The average per-ton selling price for the heritage aggregates product line was $12.77 and $11.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The heritage a ggregates product line pricing increase of 8.6% reflects growth in all reportable groups, led by the 13.7% increase in the West Group. The most significant improvement was achieved in the central Texas region.  The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7.4% and 4.7%, respectively.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the average per-ton selling price for the acquired aggregates product line was $10.86.  The acquired locations, which are in the Colorado market, have a lower average selling price due to its inherent trucking market compared with the Corporation s overall aggregates business, which includes markets that have transportation components in the average selling price.   
 The Corporation s aggregates-related downstream product lines include ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving businesses in Arkansas, Colorado, Texas and Wyoming. Average selling prices by product line for the Corporation s aggregates-related downstream product lines are as follows:  

The decline in asphalt pricing is primarily attributable to the divestiture of the San Antonio Asphalt operations sold in fourth quarter 2015, which had a higher average selling price.  Additionally, asphalt and paving contracts in the Rocky Mountain Division contain accelerator clauses to reflect cost fluctuations in the raw materials.  Liquid asphalt, a key raw material in the manufacturing process, declined during the quarter, resulting in a lower average selling price.

    Unit shipments by product line for the Corporation s aggregates-related downstream product lines are as follows:   

The decline in asphalt product line shipments is primarily attributable to the divestiture of San Antonio Asphalt operations, sold in fourth quarter 2015, which contributed 209,000 tons during the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
 The ready mixed concrete product line continued to benefit from strong demand and better pricing.  Inclusive of operations acquired during the quarter, these factors drove a 17.8% increase in shipments and a 6.1% increase in average selling price. Increased sales led to a 380-basis-point improvement in gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues).  Excluding the results of businesses acquired in 2016, ready mixed concrete volumes and average selling price increased 3.6% and 7.0%, respectively, driving gross margin expansion (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 415 basis points. 
 Cement Business  
 For the quarter, the Cement business generated $60.1 million of net sales and $29.7 million of gross profit. Cement shipments declined while pricing improved by 0.3% (excluding the impact of the California cement operations sold in 2015). The business  reported quarterly gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 49.5%, an expansion of 570-basis-points compared to prior year (excluding the impact of the California cement operations sold in 2015).  The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to disciplined cost control, including lower kiln maintenance costs. 
 During the third quarter 2016, the business incurred $1.8 million in planned cement kiln maintenance costs, and expects to incur $9.7 million in the fourth quarter.  Kiln maintenance costs in 2015 for the Texas plants were $3.4 million, $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $9.3 million for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

 The decline in 2016 shipments is primarily attributable to the prior-year divestiture of the California operations, which accounted for 328,000 tons in the third-quarter of 2015 coupled with a decline in energy sector demand in southern Texas.   
 The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts favorable supply/demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years and growth each year through 2019.   
 Magnesia Specialties Business  
 Magnesia Specialties delivered record performance and generated a 5.2% increase in third-quarter net sales of $60.2 million as a result of higher chemical product line sales partially offset by lower shipments of dolomitic lime and periclase.  Gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 37.9% in the quarter expanded 400 basis points, driven by lower energy and kiln outage costs compared with the prior year.  Third-quarter earnings from operations were $20.4 million compared with $17.0 million.

    Gross profit (loss) by business is as follows:   

The consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the quarter was 28.2%, a 210-basis-point improvement compared with the prior-year quarter.  The increase reflects pricing growth, management s cost-disciplined approach and divesting the lower-margin California cement operations at the end of the third quarter of 2015.   
 Consolidated Operating Results  
 Consolidated SG A was 5.4% of net sales, flat compared with the prior-year quarter.  
 Among other items, other operating income and expenses, net, includes gains and losses on the sale of assets; recoveries and writeoffs related to customer accounts receivable; rental, royalty and services income; accretion expense, depreciation expense and gains and losses related to asset retirement obligations. For the third quarter, consolidated other operating income and expenses, net, was income of $4.6 million in 2016 and an expense of $26.0 million in 2015.  Operating income and expenses, net, for 2015 reflects the net loss recognized on the disposal of the California cement operations.  
   Other nonoperating income and expenses, net, includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, interest and other miscellaneous income and equity adjustments for nonconsolidated affiliates.  Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses, net, was income of $10.6 million and $4.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,

  respectively.  The increase in income in 2016 compared to 2015 is prima  rily attributable to a net gain recognized on the purchase of the remaining interest in a joint venture.  
 The estimated effective income tax rate for the quarter was 30.6%.  For the year, the Corporation expects to fully utilize the remaining allowable net operating loss carryforwards of $33 million acquired with TXI.

    Gross profit (loss) by business is as follows:   

Consolidated SG A expenses were 6.6% of net sales, up 10 basis points compared with the prior-year period, driven by higher incentive compensation, including share based compensation. 
 For the first nine months, consolidated other operating income and expenses, net, was income of $7.9 million in 2016 compared with expense of $28.0 million in 2015.  Income in 2016 reflects a favorable settlement of commodity contracts assumed in a 2014 acquisition in the Cement business that were priced above market at that date.  In 2015, the Corporation recognized a net loss on the disposal of the California cement operations.   
 In addition to other offsetting amounts, other nonoperating income and expenses, net, are comprised generally of interest income and net equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments.  Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was income of $19.7 million compared with income of $6.6 million in 2015, primarily driven by a net gain recognized on the purchase of the remaining interest in a joint venture and higher earnings from nonconsolidated equity investees. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
   Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $414.1 million compared with $319.6 million for the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  Operating cash flow is primarily derived from consolidated net

  earnings before deducting depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the impact of changes in working capital.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization were as follows:   

The seasonal nature of the construction aggregates business impacts quarterly operating cash flow when compared with the full year. Full-year 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was $573.2 million compared with $319.6 million for the first nine months of 2015.  
 During the first nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation invested $285.5 million of capital into its business. Full-year capital spending is expected to approximate $350 million. 
 In the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation acquired the outstanding stock of Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, Inc., and Rocky Mountain Premix Inc.  The acquisition included four aggregates plants, two asphalt plants and two ready mixed concrete operations, and provides more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expands the Corporation s presence along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to 80% of Colorado s population.  
 During the third quarter 2016, the Corporation acquired the remaining interest in Ratliff Ready-Mix, L.P. ( Ratliff ), which operates ready mixed concrete plants in central Texas.  Prior to the acquisition, the Corporation owned a 40% interest in Ratliff which was accounted for under the equity method.  The Corporation was required to re-measure the existing 40% interest to fair value upon closing of the transaction, resulting in a gain of $5,863,000, which is recorded in other nonoperating income.  These operations are reported in the West Group.     
 The Corporation can repurchase its common stock through open-market purchases pursuant to authority granted by its Board of Directors or through private transactions at such prices and upon such terms as the Chief Executive Officer deems appropriate. During the first nine months, the Corporation repurchased 1,244,000 shares of common stock for $190 million.  At September 30, 2016, 15,471,000 shares of common stock were remaining under the Corporation s repurchase authorization.   
   The Credit Agreement (which consists of a $250 million (original amount) Term Loan Facility and a $350 million Revolving Facility) requires the Corporation s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ( EBITDA ), as defined, for the trailing-twelve month period (the Ratio) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Corporation may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions for a period of 180 days so long as the Corporation, as a consequence of such specified acquisition, does not have its ratings on long-term unsecured debt fall below BBB by Standard   Poor s or Baa2 by Moody s and the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if there are no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower,

  will be reduced for purposes of the covenant calculation by the Corporation s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million, such reduction n  ot to exceed $200 million.   
 The Ratio is calculated as debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower, divided by consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement, for the trailing-twelve months. Consolidated EBITDA is generally defined as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for continuing operations. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense is added back and interest income is deducted in the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. Certain other nonrecurring noncash items, if they occur, can affect the calculation of consolidated EBITDA.  
 In accordance with the amended Credit Agreement, the Corporation adjusted consolidated EBITDA to add back any integration or similar costs or expenses related to the TXI business combination incurred in any period prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the TXI business combination, not to exceed $70,000,000.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Corporation s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing-twelve months EBITDA was 1.89 times and was calculated as follows:  

The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Corporation s other debt agreements. In the event of a default on the Ratio, the lenders can terminate the Credit Agreement and Trade Receivable Facility and declare any outstanding balances as immediately due.  Outstanding amounts on the Trade Receivable Facility have been classified as a current liability on the Corporation s consolidated balance sheet.  On September 28, 2016, the Corporation increased the borrowing capacity from $250,000,000 to $300,000,000 and extended the maturity to September 27, 2017. 
   Cash on hand, along with the Corporation s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital

  resources necessary to support a  nticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, meet capital expenditures and discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise, allow for payment of dividends for the foreseeable future and enable the buyba  ck of shares through the share repurchase program.  At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had $438 million of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility, subject to complying with the related leverage covenant. Th  e Revolving Facility expires on November 29, 2018 and the Trade Receivable Facility expires on September 27, 2017.   
 The Floating Rate Notes have been classified as a noncurrent liability as the Corporation has the intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis before or at its maturity of June 30, 2017. 
 The Corporation may be required to obtain financing to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if any such opportunities arise, or to refinance outstanding debt. Any strategic acquisition of size for cash would likely require an appropriate balance of newly-issued equity with debt in order to maintain a composite investment-grade credit rating. Furthermore, the Corporation is exposed to the credit markets, through the interest cost related to its variable-rate debt, which included borrowings under its Term Loan Facility and Trade Receivable Facility at September 30, 2016. The Corporation is currently rated by three credit rating agencies; two of those agencies  credit ratings are investment-grade level and the third agency s credit rating is one level below investment grade. The Corporation s composite credit rating remains at investment-grade level, which facilitates obtaining financing at lower rates than noninvestment-grade ratings.  
 TRENDS AND RISKS  
 The Aggregates business, both production and demand, and the demand in the Cement business are significantly affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions.  Production and shipment levels for aggregates, asphalt, ready mixed concrete and road paving materials correlate with general construction activity levels, most of which occurs in the spring, summer and fall.  Thus, production and shipment levels vary by quarter.  Operations concentrated in the northern and midwestern United States generally experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeast and southwest. Excessive rainfall, and conversely excessive drought, can also jeopardize shipments, production and profitability in all markets served by the Corporation.  Because of the potentially significant impact of weather on the Corporation s operations, current-period and year-to-date results are not indicative of expected performance for other interim periods or the full year.   
 The Corporation outlined the risks associated with its business in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Management continues to evaluate its exposure to all operating risks on an ongoing basis.  
 OUTLOOK  
 The Corporation is encouraged by positive trends in the markets it serves and its ability to execute its strategic business plans.  Notably:  

For the public sector, continued modest growth is expected in 2016 as new monies begin to flow into the system, particularly in the second half of the year.  Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects, including support from the   Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act   ( TIFIA ), are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in public-sector activity.     

Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors.  The Dodge Momentum Index is near its highest level since 2009 and signals continued growth.  Additionally,

en  ergy-related economic activity, including follow-on public and private construction activities in the Corporation s primary markets, will be mixed with overall strength in large downstream construction projects, providing a counterbalance to declines in sh  ale exploration-related volumes.      

Residential construction is expected to continue to experience good growth metrics, driven by positive employment gains, historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption, and higher multi-family rental rates.       

 RISKS TO OUTLOOK 
 The 2016 outlook includes management s assessment of the likelihood of certain risks and uncertainties that will affect performance, including but not limited to: both price and volume, and a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the termination, capping and/or reduction of the federal and/or state gasoline tax(es) or other revenue related to infrastructure construction; a significant change in the funding patterns for traditional federal, state and/or local infrastructure projects; the United States Congress  inability to reach agreement on the federal budget and this impact on federal highway spending; the volatility in the commencement of infrastructure projects; a reduction in defense spending, and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in nonresidential construction; a further decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns in response to this decline and certain regulatory or other economic factors; a slowdown in the residential construction recovery, or some combination thereof; a reduction in economic activity in the Corporation s Midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural Act of 2014 and a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads; an increase in the cost of compliance with governmental laws, rules and regulations; and unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to its cement production facilities.  Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability.  If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced.  Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations.  The Magnesia Specialties business essentially runs at capacity; therefore any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment. 
 The Corporation s principal business serves customers in aggregates-related construction markets.  This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables.  The level of aggregates demand in the Corporation s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability.  Production costs in the Aggregates business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly.  Diesel fuel and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts.  Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Corporation s long-haul distribution network.  The Cement business is also energy intensive and fluctuation in the price of coal affects costs.  The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas. 
   Transportation in the Corporation s long-haul network, particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Corporation s efficient transportation of aggregate into certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida and the Gulf Coast.  In addition, availability of rail cars and locomotives

  affects the Corporation s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals, to both the Corporation s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and customers.  The av  ailability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Corporation s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.    
 All of the Corporation s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability.  The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather.  Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.  In fact, in early October 2016, Hurricane Matthew generated winds and significant amounts of rainfall disrupting operations from the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.  Management expects operations, particularly in eastern North Carolina to be affected throughout the fourth quarter.  However, after hurricane-related flood waters recede, management expects an increase in construction activity as roads, homes and businesses are repaired. 
 Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Corporation s control.  In addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction, the Corporation is exposed to risk in its estimated outlook from credit markets and the availability of and interest cost related to its debt. 
 The Corporation s future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels.

        It  em 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
 The Corporation s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs.  
 Management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Corporation s business. Demand for aggregates and cement products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues. Further, delays of large-scale infrastructure projects could occur if Departments of Transportation take longer than expected to move projects from the letting to the commencement stage.  Additionally, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty. 
 Demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates. The Federal Reserve have maintained the federal funds rate near zero percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unchanged since 2008. The residential construction market accounted for 17% of the Corporation s aggregates product line shipments in 2015.  
 Aside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Corporation s earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. However, rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results. In fact, since 2007, the Corporation s profitability increased when interest rates rose, based on the last twelve months quarterly historical net income regression versus a 10-year U.S. government bond. In essence, the Corporation s underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates.

At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had a $600 million Credit Agreement, comprised of a $350 million Revolving Facility and $250 million (original amount) Term Loan Facility, and a $300 million Trade Receivable Facility. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on borrowings of $419 million, which was the collective outstanding balance at September 30, 2016, would increase interest expense by $4.2 million on an annual basis.   
 Pension Expense.  The Corporation s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and, for the qualified pension plans only, the expected long-term rate of return on assets. Therefore, the Corporation has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the Corporation s annual pension expense is discussed in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
 Energy Costs . Energy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, coal and liquid asphalt, represent significant production costs of the Corporation. The Corporation entered into a fixed price arrangement, which expires December 31, 2016, for approximately 40% of its diesel fuel to reduce its diesel fuel price risk. The Magnesia Specialties business has fixed price agreements covering half of its 2016 coal requirements and the cement business has fixed pricing agreements on 100% of its 2016 coal requirements. A hypothetical 10% change in the Corporation s energy prices in 2016 as compared with 2015, assuming constant volumes, would change 2016 energy expense by $25.7 million. However, the impact would be partially offset by the change in the amount capitalized into inventory standards.

    Commodity risk  .   Cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand.   Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the Corporation s control. Increases in the production capacity of industry parti  cipants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. There can be no assurance that prices for products sold will not dec  line in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Based on forecasted net sales for the Cement business for full-year 2016 of $250 million to $260   million, a hypothetical 10% change in sales price would impact net sales by $25 million to $26 million  .   
     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 As of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.  As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in making this assessment of changes in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, management has excluded the internal controls of its newly-acquired Ratliff ready mixed concrete operations, which are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period ending September 30, 2016.  The excluded assets constituted less than 1% of consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2016 and less than 1% of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
   
 The operation of the Corporation s domestic aggregates quarries and mines is subject to regulation  by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ).  MSHA inspects the Corporation s quarries and mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act.  Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation.  Citations or orders may be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.  
   
  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ), the Corporation is required to present information regarding certain mining safety and health citations which MSHA has issued with respect to its aggregates mining operations in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the quarry or mine and types of operations (underground or surface), (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and location to location, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.    
   
  The Corporation has provided the information below in response to the SEC s rules and regulations issued under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The disclosures reflect U.S. mining operations only, as the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the SEC rules and regulations thereunder do not apply to the Corporation s quarries and mines operated outside the United States.  
   
  The Corporation presents the following items regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the three months ended September 30, 2016:  

Total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the Corporation has received a citation from MSHA (hereinafter,  Section 104 S S Citations ).  If MSHA determines that a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard is likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance contributed to by the violation, MSHA will classify the violation as a  significant and substantial  violation (commonly referred to as a  S S  violation).  MSHA inspectors will classify each citation or order written as a  S S  violation or not.     

Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act (hereinafter,    Section 104(b) Orders ).  These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines a   previous violation covered by a Section 104(a) citation has not been totally abated within the prescribed time period, so a further order is needed to require the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons (except authorized persons) from the affect  ed area of a quarry or mine.     

Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act (hereinafter,  Section 104(d) Citations and Orders ).  These violations are similar to those described above, but the standard is that the violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a safety or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger, and the MSHA inspector finds that the violation is caused by an unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with the health and safety standards.     

Total number of flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act (hereinafter,  Section 110(b)(2) Violations ). These violations are penalty violations issued if MSHA determines that violations are  flagrant , for which civil penalties may be assessed. A  flagrant  violation means a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.     

Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act (hereinafter,  Section 107(a) Orders ).  These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines an imminent danger exists in the quarry or mine and results in orders of immediate withdrawal of all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the area of the quarry or mine affected by its condition until the imminent danger and the underlying conditions causing the imminent danger no longer exist.     

Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act.  These are the amounts of proposed assessments issued by MSHA with each citation or order for the time period covered by the reports. Penalties are assessed by MSHA according to a formula that considers a number of factors, including the mine operator s history, size, negligence, gravity of the violation, good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly, and the effect of the penalty on the operator s ability to continue in business.     

Total number of mining-related fatalities.  Mines subject to the Mine Act are required to report all fatalities occurring at their facilities unless the fatality is determined to be  non-chargeable  to the mining industry.  The final rules of the SEC require disclosure of mining-related fatalities at mines subject to the Mine Act.  Only fatalities determined by MSHA not to be mining-related may be excluded.      

Receipt of written notice from MSHA of a pattern (or a potential to have such a pattern) of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of other mine health or safety hazards under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act.  If MSHA determines that a mine has a  pattern  of these types of violations, or the potential to have such a pattern, MSHA is required to notify the mine operator of the existence of such a thing.     

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions pending as of the last day of period.     

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions initiated during period.     

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions resolved during period.     

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. The cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under Section 105 of the Mine Act.  Appendix 1 shows, for each of the Corporation s quarries and mines identified, as of September 30, 2016, the number of legal actions pending before the Commission, along with the number of legal actions initiated before the Commission during the quarter as well as resolved during the quarter. In addition, Appendix 1 includes a footnote to the column for legal actions before the Commission pending as of the last day of the period, which footnote breaks down that total number of legal actions pending by categories according to the type of proceeding in accordance with various categories established by the Procedural Rules of the Commission.
