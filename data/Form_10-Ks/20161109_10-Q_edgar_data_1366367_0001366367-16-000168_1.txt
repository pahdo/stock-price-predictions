NOTE A   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Yadkin Financial Corporation (the "Company" or "Yadkin") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Yadkin Bank. The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by such accounting principles for complete financial statements. These interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes of  the Company's   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  
    
  Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance related to the Statement of Cash Flows. The new guidance clarifies the classification within the statement of cash flows for certain transactions, including debt extinguishment costs, zero-coupon debt, contingent consideration related to business combinations, insurance proceeds, equity method distributions and beneficial interests in securitizations. The guidance also clarifies that cash flows with aspects of multiple classes of cash flows or that cannot be separated by source or use should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to Credit Losses. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. Purchased credit impaired loans will receive an allowance account at the acquisition date that represents a component of the purchase price allocation. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses, with such allowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to Stock Compensation. The new guidance eliminates the concept of APIC pools for stock-based awards and requires that the related excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance also allows entities to make a one-time policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur, instead of accruing compensation cost based on the number of awards expected to vest. Additionally, the new guidance changes the requirement for an award to qualify for equity classification by permitting tax withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rate instead of the minimum statutory tax rate. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to Derivatives and Hedging. The new guidance clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is used to determine whether the embedded derivative should be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as a derivative. An entity performing the assessment will be required to assess the embedded call or put options solely in accordance with the pre-existing four-step decision sequence. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to Leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities related to certain operating leases on the balance sheet. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new guidance addresses the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to Business Combinations  .   The new guidance requires acquirers to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts (that are identified during the measurement period) in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The new guidance also requires such amounts to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The Company early-adopted this guidance effective September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements. All measurement period adjustments related to the March 1, 2016  acquisition of NewBridge Bancorp were recorded in the period in which the adjustment was determined.   
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to Fair Value Measurement. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to classify in the fair value hierarchy any investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient. This guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to Debt Issuance Costs  .   The new guidance requires a reporting entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this guidance. This guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $536   of debt issuance costs that were included in long-term debt. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE B   PER SHARE RESULTS 
    
  Basic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilutive impact of restricted stock as well as the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive common stock options and common stock warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the Company.  
    
  Basic and diluted net income per share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below.

NOTE C   MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS 
    
  Proposed Merger with F.N.B. Corporation 
    
  On July 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation ( FNB ). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company will merge with and into FNB (the  Merger ), with FNB continuing as the surviving corporation. As soon as practicable following consummation of the Merger, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Yadkin Bank, will merge with and into FNB s wholly-owned subsidiary,  First National Bank of Pennsylvania ("FNB Bank"), with FNB Bank continuing as the surviving entity (the  Bank Merger ).  
    
  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Company s shareholders will have the right to receive   2.16   shares of FNB common stock, par value   $0.01  , for each share of the Company s common stock. Based on FNB s closing price of   $13.20   as of July 20, 2016, the day before the transaction was announced, the estimated aggregate purchase price was   $1,470,000  . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 
    
  Acquisition of NewBridge Bancorp 
    
  On March 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of NewBridge Bancorp ( NewBridge ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 12, 2015 (the  NewBridge Merger Agreement ). Pursuant to the NewBridge Merger Agreement, each share of NewBridge Class A common stock and Class B common stock was converted into the right to receive   0.50   shares of the common stock of the Company (the "NewBridge Merger"). Based on the Company's stock price at the closing date of the NewBridge Merger, purchase consideration totaled   $431,336  . Immediately following the merger of NewBridge into Yadkin, NewBridge Bank, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank, merged with and into Yadkin Bank, with Yadkin Bank surviving such merger.  
    
  The NewBridge Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with Yadkin as the legal and accounting acquirer and NewBridge as the legal and accounting acquiree. The assets and liabilities of NewBridge have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of Yadkin for periods following the merger date. The Company may refine its valuations of acquired NewBridge assets and liabilities for up to one year following the merger date. The NewBridge Merger had a significant impact on all aspects of the Company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the NewBridge Merger may not be comparable to financial results prior to the merger.

The purchase price is calculated based on the number of Yadkin shares issued multiplied by the share price as shown in the following table. The purchase price also includes cash paid to NewBridge shareholders in lieu of fractional shares as well as the value of stock-base compensation awards assumed on the merger date.  

The following table presents the NewBridge assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 1, 2016, the initial fair value adjustments, the measurement period adjustments, the purchase price and calculation of the residual goodwill.

Explanation of initial fair value adjustments and measurement period adjustments 
  (a)  Adjustment reflects opening fair value of securities portfolio, which was established as the new book basis of the portfolio. 
  (b)  Adjustment reflects fair value discount of   $32,589   on the loan portfolio, reversal of   $3,450   in net deferred loan costs, and reversal of   $9,844   in previously-existing fair value discount recognized by NewBridge in prior acquisitions. The fair value discount was calculated by forecasting cash flows over the expected remaining life of each loan and discounting those cash flows to present value using current market rates for similar loans. Forecasted cash flows include an estimate of lifetime credit losses on the loan portfolio. 
  (c)  Adjustment reflects the elimination of NewBridge's historical allowance for loan losses of   $21,100  .  
  (d)  Adjustment reflects fair value adjustments on acquired branch and administrative offices.  
  (e)  Adjustment reflects the tax impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. 
  (f)  Adjustment reflects the fair value of the acquired core deposit intangible, net of the reversal of core deposit intangible recorded by NewBridge in prior acquisitions. 
  (g)  Adjustment reflects the impact of fair value adjustments on other assets, which include adjustments related to the elimination of accrued interest on purchased credit-impaired loans, recognition of a servicing asset related to U.S. Small Business Association ("SBA") loans, and termination of certain derivative contracts.  
  (h) Adjustment reflects the fair value premium on time deposits, which was calculated by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate.  
  (i) Adjustments reflect the fair value adjustments for a short-term repurchase obligation and Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. The repurchase obligation was valued by discounting future contractual interest payments at a current market interest rate for a similar instrument. For FHLB advances, the fair value was calculated by reference to the acquisition date prepayment penalty the FHLB would charge to terminate the advance. 
  (j) Adjustments reflect fair value adjustments for subordinated debt obligations and junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities outstanding at the acquisition date.   
  (k) Adjustments reflect compensation obligations, reserve for unfunded commitments, benefit costs for merger-related obligations, and miscellaneous other accrued liabilities.  
  (l)   Adjustment to initial fair value of investment securities. 
  (m) Adjustments to initial fair values of premises and equipment 
  (n) Adjustment to initial fair value of other real estate.  
  (o)  Deferred tax adjustment resulting from adjustments (l), (m), (n), (p) and (q) 
  (p)  Adjustment to initial fair value of accrued interest receivable.  
  (q)  Adjustment to initial fair value of accrued liabilities. 
  (r)  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets. 
    
  Supplemental Pro Forma Information 
    
  The table below presents supplemental pro forma information as if the NewBridge Merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, which was January 1, 2015. Pro forma results include adjustments for amortization and accretion of fair value adjustments and do not include any projected cost savings or other anticipated benefits of the merger. Therefore, the pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transactions been effected on the assumed date.  

(a) For purposes of the supplemental pro forma information, merger-related expenses of   $17,959   that are reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $3,532   of merger-related expenses that were recorded by NewBridge prior to the merger date were reflected in the pro forma presentation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These pro forma merger-related expenses include   $7,934   of professional fees paid for investment banking, legal and accounting services,   $8,596   of personnel-related expenses,   $4,139   of facility and equipment-related expenses, and   $821   of other miscellaneous expenses related to the NewBridge Merger.

NOTE D   INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
    
  The following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held to maturity by major classification.

The following tables summarize gross unrealized losses and fair values, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.  

The table below summarizes the number of investment securities in an unrealized loss position. 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   20   securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than a twelve month period. The Company had   $900   in gross unrealized losses on   6   corporate bonds that had been in unrealized loss positions for more than twelve months as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for these corporate issuers, which are all large, investment grade financial institutions, the Company does not believe the unrealized losses on these bonds were due to credit events. Additionally, unrealized losses on equity securities were primarily related to a common stock investment in a publicly-traded business development company that provides financing for lower middle-market companies and financial sponsors. Based on a review of financial statements and other financial data for this business development company, the Company believes the unrealized losses to be temporary. The Company will continue to closely monitor and evaluate this common stock investment for signs of other than temporary impairment in future periods. 
    
  Debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. Further, because the Company does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, unrealized losses on such securities were not considered to represent other-than-temporary impairment as of   September 30, 2016  .

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held no individual investment securities with an aggregate book value greater than   10 percent   of total shareholders  equity. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , investment securities with carrying values of   $368,522   and   $279,953  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, borrowings and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 
    
  The amortized cost and fair values of securities available for sale, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  

The following table summarizes securities gains for the periods presented. 

NOTE E   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's loans by type. 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans with a recorded investment of     $1,796,833   and   $948,433  , respectively, were pledged to secure borrowings or available lines of credit with correspondent banks.

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 
    
  Loans for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered purchased credit-impaired ("PCI") loans. The following table relates to NewBridge PCI loans and summarizes the contractually required payments, which includes principal and interest, expected cash flows to be collected, and the fair value of acquired PCI loans at the merger date. 

The following table summarizes changes in accretable yield, or income expected to be collected, related to all of the Company's PCI loans for the periods presented. 

The outstanding balance of PCI loans consists of the undiscounted sum of all amounts, including amounts deemed principal, interest, fees, penalties, and other under the loan, owed by the borrower at the reporting date, whether or not currently due and whether or not any such amounts have been written or charged off. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans was   $207,795   and   $160,500   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Purchased Non-impaired Loans 
    
  Purchased non-impaired loans are also recorded at fair value at acquisition, and the related fair value discount or premium is recognized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each loan. The following table relates to acquired NewBridge purchased non-impaired loans and provides the contractually required payments, fair value, and estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the merger date.

For non-PCI loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. For loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. Historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("PD") and loss given default ("LGD") for each loan grouping. PDs represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and LGDs represent the estimated magnitude of loss the Company will incur if a loan defaults. A loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. Historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. These historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine ALLL reserve rates for each loan grouping. Qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the ALLL calculation.  
    
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans according to credit risk. The Company uses the following general definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass.    These loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted. 

Special Mention.   Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Loans where adverse economic conditions have developed that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt, but substantially increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating. 

Substandard.    Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful.    Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

The following table provides information on impaired loans. This table excludes PCI loans and loans evaluated collectively as a homogeneous group. 

The following table provides the average balance of impaired loans for each period presented and interest income recognized during the period in which the loans were considered impaired.  

The Company may modify certain loans under terms that are below market in order to maximize the amount collected from a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs").     TDRs are evaluated individually for impairment based on the collateral value, if the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, or discounted expected cash flows, if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. The Company has no commitments to lend additional funds to any borrowers that have had a loan modified in a TDR. The following table provides the number and recorded investment of TDRs outstanding.

The following tables provide the number and recorded investment of TDRs modified during the periods presented. 

One   TDR totaling   $353 thousand   was modified in the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   and subsequently defaulted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   Two   TDRs totaling   $343 thousand   that were modified in the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015   subsequently defaulted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company does not generally forgive principal or unpaid interest when restructuring loans. Therefore, the recorded investment in TDRs during   2016   and   2015   did not change following the modifications.  

NOTE F - PURCHASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
    
  The Company previously invested in short-term trade accounts receivable, which were purchased on an exchange using qualified intermediaries. Income from purchased accounts receivable, which is recorded in other non-interest income, totaled   $292   and   $673  , respectively, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company suspended its purchased accounts receivable program during   2016   and, except as noted below, all purchased accounts receivable have been repaid as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , purchased accounts receivable includes delinquent short-term receivables of   $7,907  , which are due from a U.S. bioenergy company that produces ethanol, with the debt guaranteed by its Spanish parent company. The Spanish parent company commenced pre-insolvency proceedings in Spain during November, 2015, which allows a business to restructure its financial creditor debt on a voluntary basis without filing a full insolvency proceeding. The Company is an operational creditor, and its debt and accrued interest are not affected under the Spanish proceedings. Only if the Spanish parent enters into an insolvency proceeding can the debt including interest to the Company be subject to adjustment. The prior agreement between the Spanish Parent and its financial creditors has been renegotiated, and the revised agreement has been presented to and approved by the Spanish Court, with noted exceptions, prior to the expiration of the seven month period from and after March 28, 2016. The Spanish parent has further filed a secondary pre-insolvency proceeding requesting additional relief from its financial creditors.

An involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against the U.S. subsidiary in the District of Kansas on February 11, 2016. On February 24, 2016, a related U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish parent company filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the Eastern District of Missouri, along with various affiliates, including the U.S. subsidiary, with joint administration requested. On February 29, 2016, the Kansas case for the U.S. subsidiary was converted to a voluntary Chapter 11 case, with venue transferred to the Eastern District of Missouri on March 1, 2016. At this time, management lacks sufficient information to determine the extent of loss on the investment in purchased accounts receivable in the pending bankruptcy case for the U.S. subsidiary. Management similarly lacks sufficient information to determine the extent of recovery possible on the guarantee by the Spanish parent company. Due to uncertainties regarding the probability and amount of any loss, there was   no   contingency accrual related to this potential exposure as of   September 30, 2016  .  

NOTE G   LOAN SERVICING 
    
  Mortgage Loan Servicing 
    
  The Company retains the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others was   $726,024   and   $563,802   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. MSRs are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period, that net servicing income is expected to be received based on estimates of net cash flows on the loans serviced. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. Mortgage servicing fees, which are recorded in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled   $423   and   $326  , respectively, in the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  , and   $1,154   and   $928  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The following table summarizes MSR activity for the periods presented.  

MSRs are separated into pools based on common risk characteristics of the underlying loans, and impairment is evaluated at least quarterly at the pool level. If impairment exists at the pool level, the MSR is written down through a valuation allowance and is charged against mortgage income. Valuation allowances at period end are summarized in the preceding table. 
    
  The fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and is determined by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. Changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of MSRs. Generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR. Measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time.

The characteristics and sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs to changes in key assumptions is included in the accompanying table. 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. Also, in the preceding table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumptions. Frequently, changes in one factor would  result in another factor changing, which would magnify or contract the effect of the change. 
    
  SBA-Guaranteed Loan Servicing  
    
  The Company retains the servicing rights on SBA-guaranteed loans sold to investors. The standard sale structure under the SBA Secondary Participation Guaranty Agreement provides for the Company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payment received on the loan, which is commonly known as a servicing spread. The unpaid principal balance of SBA-guaranteed loans serviced for investors was   $240,081   and   $205,879   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. SBA-guaranteed loan servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or market. SBA servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the related loans serviced as a reduction to the servicing income recognized from the servicing spread. SBA servicing fees, which are recorded in government-guaranteed lending income in the consolidated statements of operations, totaled   $528   and   $473  , respectively, in the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  , and   $1,597   and   $1,258  , respectively, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The table below summarizes the activity in the SBA-guaranteed loan servicing asset for the periods presented. 

The fair value of the servicing asset is compared to the amortized basis when certain triggering events occur. If the amortized basis exceeds the fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to fair value through a valuation allowance on the asset and a charge against SBA income. There was   no   valuation allowance recorded on the SBA-guaranteed loan servicing asset as of     September 30, 2015  .

NOTE H   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the maximum exposure the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
    
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, upon extension of credit is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral obtained varies but may include real estate, equipment, stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the contractual amount of the Company s exposure to off-balance sheet commitments. 

The reserve for unfunded commitments was   $1,105   and   $603   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

NOTE I   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. These instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate, and market or liquidity risks. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI") for effective hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings for all other derivatives.  
    
  Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  The table below provides a summary of forward starting pay fixed interest rate swaps that are being used to hedge short-term FHLB advances. These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the change in fair value recognized in OCI. The purpose of these cash flow hedges is to reduce the Company's exposure to variability in interest payments attributable to changes in the three-month LIBOR component of three-month FHLB advances. Each three-month FHLB advance will be executed to correspond to the effective dates of the respective interest rate swaps and will continue to be rolled for the full term of each interest rate swap. 

The following table provides information on a receive fixed interest rate swap that is being used to hedge certain floating rate loans. This interest rate swap is expected to be highly effective and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge with the change in fair value recognized in OCI. The purpose of this cash flow hedge is to reduce the Company's exposure to variability in interest receipts attributable to changes in one-month LIBOR, which is the index underlying the hedged floating rate loans.

    YADKIN FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

In 2015, the Company terminated certain pay fixed interest rate swaps. For terminated interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") prior to termination will be amortized to yield over the period the hedged transactions impact earnings. The hedged transactions are currently outstanding and are expected to remain outstanding through the full original term of the interest rate swaps. The following table summarizes information regarding the terminated interest rate swaps.  

Interest Rate Caps 
    
  In previous years, the Company purchased interest rate caps that are being used to hedge a floating rate subordinated term loan and certain floating rate trust preferred securities ("TRUPs"). The underlying index for each debt instrument is three-month LIBOR. In the event that the underlying index rate exceeds the strike rate on the respective cap, the counterparty would pay the Company the difference between the underlying index and the strike rate.  
    
  These interest rate cap contracts are classified as effective cash flow hedges. Therefore, the changes in fair value of the caps are recognized in OCI. The following table summarizes key terms of each interest rate cap. 

Mortgage Loan Commitments 
    
  The Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with customers and commitments to sell mortgages to investors. The forward sale commitments are entered into with investors to manage the interest rate risk associated with the customer interest rate lock commitments, and both are considered derivative financial instruments. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments is based on the value that can be generated when the underlying loan is sold on the secondary market and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income. The fair value of the forward sale commitments is based on changes in the value of the commitment, principally because of changes in interest rates, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities and on the consolidated statements of operations in mortgage banking income.

The following table summarizes the balance sheet location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments grouped by the underlying hedged instrument. 

Activity in AOCI related to cash flow hedges is presented in Note K. If a cash flow hedge ceases to be highly effective or is terminated, then the hedge is dedesignated, and effective changes in value that are recorded in AOCI before dedesignation are amortized to yield over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If the transaction is no longer probable of occurring during the forecast period or within a short period thereafter, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss in AOCI is reported in earnings immediately. 
    
  The Company only transacts with derivative counterparties with strong credit standings and requires liquid collateral to secure credit exposure. 

NOTE J   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants, with a three level valuation input hierarchy. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 
    
  Investment Securities.   Securities available for sale ("AFS") are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurements are based upon quoted market exchange prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, third-party pricing sources are generally utilized to determine fair value. These fair values are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. Level 1 securities include securities traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, or SBA-guaranteed securities where active market pricing is readily available. Level 2 securities generally include GSE securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by GSEs, private label mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, corporate debt securities, and collateralized loan obligations. Level 3 securities include one municipal bond and certain corporate debt securities with limited trading activity. The following table provides the components of the change in fair value of Level 3 available for sale securities for the periods presented.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

SBA-Guaranteed Loans.   The Company has elected to account for certain SBA-guaranteed loans at fair value on a recurring basis. Generally, the Company has reached an agreement with an investor to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans, and these amounts are classified in loans held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale is complete. The unguaranteed retained portion of the loans remains in loans held for investment and continues to be adjusted to fair value over the remaining life of the respective loans. Fair value estimates for these loans are based on observable market data and pricing and are therefore classified as recurring Level 2. 
    
  Derivatives.   Derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps and are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or third party pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. Currently outstanding derivatives, except for mortgage interest rate lock commitments described below, are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Mortgage Loan Commitments.   The fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are included in derivatives assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on servicing rate premium, origination income net of origination costs, fall out rates and changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. Interest rate lock commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as Level 3. The following table provides the components of the change in fair value of interest rate lock commitments for the periods presented.  

The fair value of forward sale commitments, also included in derivative assets and liabilities in the fair value measurement tables below, is based on changes in loan pricing between the commitment date and period end. Forward sale commitments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified as Level 2. The difference between the interest rate lock commitment issuances and settlements in the preceding table and the change in fair value of forward sale commitments in the period represents the gain on mortgage loan commitments and is included in mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Loans.   Loans are not generally recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. However, certain loans are determined to be impaired, and those loans are charged down to estimated fair value. The fair value of impaired loans that are collateral dependent is based on collateral value. For impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated value is based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring a charge-off represent loans for which the estimated fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. When the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the Company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available, or the Company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, and there is no observable market price, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring Level 3. 
    
  Other Real Estate.   Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of loans to other real estate. Subsequently, other real estate is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. Given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties and market discounts applied to appraised values, the Company classifies other real estate as nonrecurring Level 3.

Quantitative Information About Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The table below outlines the valuation techniques, unobservable inputs, and the range of quantitative inputs used in the valuations.  

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s interest rate lock commitments is the closing ratio (or pull through rate), which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment rate. Therefore, an increase in the pull through rates (i.e., higher percentage of loans estimated to close) will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments increasing in a gain position, or decreasing in a loss position. The pull through ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull through rate is computed based on historical internal data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the Company s mortgage banking department. 
    
  Due to the nature of the Company s business, a significant portion of its assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments. Accordingly, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments are disclosed. Quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as an estimate of the fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of such instruments has been derived based on assumptions with respect to future economic conditions, the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. Different assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. Accordingly, the net amounts ultimately collected could be materially different from the estimates presented below. In addition, these estimates are only indicative of the values of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the Company taken as a whole. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.   The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Investment Securities Available for Sale.   A description of fair value estimates for securities available for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above. 
    
  Investment Securities Held to Maturity.   The fair value of the municipal bonds classified as held to maturity are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. These securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy since the inputs used in the valuation are readily available market inputs. 
    
  Loans Held For Sale.   The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market. A description of fair value estimates for SBA-guaranteed loans held for sale is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above. 
    
  Loans.   Expected cash flows are forecasted over the remaining life of each loan and are discounted to present value at current market interest rates for similar loans considering loan collateral type and credit quality. 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.   Given the option to redeem this stock at par through the FHLB, the carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value.

Purchased Accounts Receivable.   Purchased accounts receivable, which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are initially recorded at fair value, which is the same as the discounted purchase price, and generally have maturities between 30 and 60 days. Due to the short duration of these assets, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Deposits  . The fair value of demand deposits, savings, money market and NOW accounts represents the amount payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits is estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows on the time deposit portfolio discounted using interest rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt.   The fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt are based upon the discounted value when using current rates at which borrowings of similar maturity could be obtained. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Accrued Interest Payable.   The carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. 
    
  Derivative Instruments.   A description of fair value estimates for derivative instruments is included in the recurring fair value measurements section above.

  On March 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of NewBridge Bancorp ( NewBridge ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 12, 2015 (the  NewBridge Merger Agreement ). Pursuant to the NewBridge Merger Agreement, each share of NewBridge Class A common stock and Class B common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares of the common stock of the Company (the "NewBridge Merger"). Based on the Company's stock price at the closing date of the NewBridge Merger, purchase consideration totaled $431.3 million. Immediately following the merger of NewBridge into Yadkin, NewBridge Bank, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank, merged with and into Yadkin Bank, with Yadkin Bank surviving such merger.  
    
  The NewBridge Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with Yadkin as the legal and accounting acquirer and NewBridge as the legal and accounting acquiree. The assets and liabilities of NewBridge have been recorded at their estimated fair values and added to those of Yadkin for periods following the merger date. The Company may refine its valuations of acquired NewBridge assets and liabilities for up to one year following the merger date. 
    
  The Company is currently the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina and ranks first by North Carolina deposit market share among community banks. The Company now operates   98   full-service banking locations in its North Carolina and South Carolina banking network and has a significant presence in all major North Carolina markets, including Charlotte, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and Wilmington. The previously announced systems integration (originally scheduled for September 2016), will now be completed following the FNB Merger. The NewBridge Merger added $2.1 billion in loans, $2.0 billion in deposits, and resulted in significant changes across most balance sheet categories. The NewBridge Merger, which was effective on March 1, 2016, had a material impact on Company's results of operations. As a result, the Company's 2016 financial results may not be comparable to financial results in prior periods.   

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Statements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) net operating earnings available to common shareholders; (ii) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, (iii) operating non-interest income, (iv) operating non-interest expense, (v) operating efficiency ratio, (vi) taxable-equivalent net interest income, (vii) taxable-equivalent net interest margin, (viii) core net interest income, (ix) core net interest margin, (x) adjusted allowance for loan losses to loans; and (xi) tangible common equity, in its analysis of the Company's performance. The adjusted allowance for loan losses non-GAAP reconciliation is presented within the allowance for loan losses section below. The tangible common equity non-GAAP reconciliations, which include tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, are presented within the capital section below. 
    
  Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company without regard to transactional activities. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Analysis of Results of Operations 
    
  Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  Net income available to common shareholders was   $16.3 million  , or   $0.32   per diluted common share, in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $11.8 million  , or   $0.37   per diluted common share, in the   third quarter   of   2015  . Net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to   $22.3 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   from   $12.5 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  
    
  Year-to-Date 
    
  Net income available to common shareholders was   $41.5 million  , or   $0.88   per diluted common share, in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $32.0 million  , or   $1.01   per diluted common share, in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which excludes certain nonrecurring income and expenses, improved to   $60.0 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $34.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  
    
  Net Interest Income    
    
  Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  Net interest income was   $64.0 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an increase from   $39.3 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . This increase was due to the impact of earning assets acquired in the NewBridge Merger as well as solid organic loan growth. Net interest margin declined from   4.19 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015   to   3.92 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , primarily due to lower-yielding acquired NewBridge loans. Core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of accretion income on net interest income, was   3.62 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   3.77 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
    
  Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled   $4.7 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , which consisted of   $1.0 million   of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) loans and   $3.7 million   of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. Net accretion income on acquired loans in the   third quarter   of   2015   totaled   $3.4 million  , which included   $895 thousand   of net accretion on PCI loans and   $2.5 million   of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. Accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included   $1.8 million   of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $978 thousand   in the   third quarter   of   2015  .

Year-to-Date 
    
  Net interest income was   $175.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , an increase from   $117.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . This increase was due to the impact of earning assets acquired in the NewBridge Merger and organic loan growth. Net interest margin declined from   4.27 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2015   to   3.97 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily due to lower-yielding acquired NewBridge loans. Core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of accretion income on net interest income, was   3.65 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   3.76 percent   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled   $13.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , which consisted of   $2.9 million   of net accretion on purchased credit-impaired ( PCI ) loans and   $10.2 million   of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. Net accretion income on acquired loans in the first   nine   months of   2015   totaled   $11.4 million  , which included   $2.7 million   of net accretion on PCI loans and   $8.7 million   of accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans. Accretion income on purchased non-impaired loans included   $4.5 million   of accelerated accretion due to principal prepayments in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $3.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .

Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's ALLL for the quarters presented. 

Provision for loan losses was   $3.0 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $1.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The higher provision for loan losses was primarily due to higher net charge-offs among commercial and industrial loans. Total net charge-offs increased to an annualized   0.18 percent   of average loans in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to an annualized   0.12 percent   of average loans in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  
    
  Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as PCI loans. Subsequent to acquisition of these loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that reflect current market conditions. If the Company has probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected at the pool level due to credit, the provision for loan losses is charged, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Events that would result in probable decreases in expected cash flows include (i) reductions in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming collateral dependent during the period for which there is an estimated collateral shortfall, (iii) non-payment of cash flows expected to be collected in prior re-estimations, and (iv) deterioration in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors.  

-   41   - 

If there are probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company will first reverse any previously established ALLL and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans. Events that would result in probable increases in expected cash flows include (i) increases in estimated collateral values for collateral dependent loans, (ii) loans becoming non-collateral dependent during the period for which there was an estimated collateral shortfall in prior estimations, (iii) actual cash flow collections in excess of prior estimates, and (iv) improvement in the weighted average credit grade or past due status for loans with cash flows estimated based on these factors. 
    
  Results of the Company s cash flow re-estimation for PCI loans in the   third quarter   of   2016   are summarized below. 

Year-to-Date 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's ALLL for the year-to-date periods presented. 

Provision for loan losses was   $7.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   $3.5 million   in the same period of   2015  . The higher provision for loan losses reflected higher provision expense on non-PCI loans, net of a provision credit on PCI loans. Provision expense on non-PCI loans was primarily due to higher net charge-offs and originated loan growth. Net charge-offs represented an annualized   0.12 percent   of average loans in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , compared to an annualized   0.11 percent   of average loans in the same period of   2015  . Net charge-offs of commercial and industrial loans increased significantly during 2016, largely due to the impact of the NewBridge loan portfolio. The current period YTD provision credit for PCI loans resulted from improving cash flows on certain of the Company's loan pools during 2016.  
    
  Non-Interest Income 
    
  The following table provides a summary of non-interest income for the periods presented. 

-   42   - 

Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  Non-interest income totaled   $16.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an increase from   $10.8 million   in the same period of   2015  . Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by   $2.2 million   primarily due to the addition of acquired NewBridge deposit accounts. Mortgage banking income improved by   $2.5 million   as a result of strong local housing markets within the Company's footprint, a favorable interest rate environment for mortgage activity and the addition of NewBridge mortgage bankers. Income from bank-owned life insurance increased   $957 thousand   during the   third quarter   of   2016   following the deaths of individuals insured by the Company.  
    
  Year-to-Date 
    
  Non-interest income totaled   $43.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , an increase from   $30.4 million   in the same period of   2015  . Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by   $5.5 million   primarily due to the addition of acquired NewBridge deposit accounts. Mortgage banking income improved by   $5.0 million   as a result of strong local housing markets within the Company's footprint, the expansion of that footprint following the NewBridge Merger, a favorable interest rate environment for mortgage activity, and a gain on the sale of certain conforming residential mortgage loans previously held in the NewBridge loan portfolio. Other non-interest income increased   $1.3 million  , primarily due to improved wealth and brokerage income.  Income from bank-owned life insurance increased   $1.3 million   during   2016   due to the addition of the NewBridge BOLI program and the deaths of individuals insured by the Company.  
    
  Non-Interest Expense 
    
  The following table provides a summary of non-interest expense for the periods presented. 

Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  Non-interest expense totaled   $51.1 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an increase from   $28.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The increase reflected the impact of the NewBridge Merger and included a   $7.1 million   increase in merger and conversion costs, which include professional fees, personnel costs, technology and facility costs, and other expenses related to the NewBridge Merger and the proposed merger with FNB. Operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from   $28.7 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   to   $43.9 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  . Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other non-interest expense categories all increased as a result of the NewBridge Merger, which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the Company's expense base.  
    
  Operating efficiency ratio, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, improved from   57.3 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015   to   54.3 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2016  . In an effort to improve operating efficiency, the Company closed ten branches in late Q2 2016. The previously announced systems integration to combine the legacy NewBridge systems and Yadkin systems (originally scheduled for September 2016), will now be completed following the FNB Merger.

Year-to-Date 
    
  Non-interest expense totaled   $146.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , an increase from   $92.1 million   the same period of   2015  . Merger and conversion costs, which includes professional fees, personnel, facility and technology costs, increased   $23.7 million   during   2016  . Operating non-interest expense, which excludes merger and conversion costs and restructuring charges, increased from   $88.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   to   $122.0 million   in the same period of   2016  , reflecting the impact of the NewBridge Merger. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other non-interest expense categories all increased as a result of the NewBridge Merger, which added employees, branch and other facilities, and equipment to the Company's existing expense base beginning March 1, 2016.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015 
    
  Income tax expense was   $10.4 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $7.9 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The Company's effective tax rate totaled   39.1 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   40.1 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . During both periods, the Company recorded additional income tax expense for adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from anticipated reductions in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate. During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the effective tax rate benefited from renewable energy tax credit investments made in late 2015, which had a favorable impact on income tax expense during   2016  .  
    
  Year-to-Date 
    
  Income tax expense was   $24.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   $19.8 million   in the same period of   2015  . The Company's effective tax rate totaled   37.2 percent   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   37.7 percent   in the same period of   2015  .   

Analysis of Financial Condition 
    
  The NewBridge Merger significantly impacted each major component of the Company's balance sheet. The following table summarizes the year-to-date changes in major balance sheet components, including and excluding the acquired NewBridge balances. 

-   44   - 

Investment Activities 
    
  The Company's investment portfolio plays a major role in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity and, therefore, is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet. In general, the primary goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds as prescribed by law and other borrowings; (iii) to provide structures and terms to enable proper interest rate risk management; and (iv) to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i), (ii) and (iii). The Company invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations and its investment policy. These securities include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of state or political subdivisions, bank eligible corporate bonds, Volcker Rule-compliant collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"), privately-issued residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, limited types of mutual funds, and equity securities. 
    
  The amortized cost and fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio were    $958.3 million   and   $966.0 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $694.5 million   and   $689.1 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . The amortized cost and fair value of the held-to-maturity securities portfolio was   $38.8 million   and   $40.7 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $39.2 million   and   $40.5 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Available-for-sale marketable investment securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the available-for-sale securities portfolio had   $10.6 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, of unrealized gains and   $2.9 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively, of unrealized losses. Marketable investment securities accounted for as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. 
    
  The securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity, and the issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay these debt obligations according to contractual terms. Management concluded that unrealized losses did not represent other-than-temporary impairment as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities portfolio. 

-   45   - 

The table below summarizes the amortized cost of debt securities in the investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , segregated by major category with ranges of maturities       and average yields. Mortgage-backed securities, and other similar securities collateralized by loan pools which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on weighted average maturities of the underlying collateral, anticipating future prepayments. 

(1)   
    Yields are calculated on a taxable equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 percent. Yields are calculated based on the amortized cost of the securities. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average life of the Company's debt securities was   4.6     years, and the weighted average effective duration was   2.8     years. 
    
  The Company owned   $41.7 million   and   $24.8 million   of Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The FHLB stock is recorded at cost and is classified separately from investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Lending Activities 
    
  The primary goal of the Company's lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the Company. In addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, the Company's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth knowledge of our local markets. Furthermore, the Company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio. In this context, the Company strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality. 
    
  The Company provides a wide range of business and consumer loans in the markets it serves. Its objective is to have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio of business and consumer loans. In order to manage loan portfolio risk, the Company has established concentration limits by borrower, product type, loan structure, and industry. The majority of business loans are secured by business assets and real estate supported in most cases by personal guarantees. Consumer loans are primarily secured with personal assets and real estate. Underwriting is primarily focused on the underlying cash flow of the business or consumer and secondarily on assets securing the loans.   
    
  Loans, net of deferred loan fees, totaled   $5.25 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $2.18 billion   from   December 31, 2015  . Excluding acquired NewBridge loans, the YTD increase in loan balances was   $115.6 million  . The following table provides a summary of the Company s loan portfolio composition by loan type. 
  
   -   46   - 

The following table summarizes the scheduled maturities of loans separated by fixed and variable rate loans.  
   
 (1) Loan maturities are presented based on the final contractual maturity of each loan and do not reflect contractual principal payments prior to maturity on amortizing loans. 
    
  Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination are accounted for as PCI loans. Where possible, PCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped into pools at acquisition. For PCI loan pools, the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the PCI loans using the effective yield method, provided that the timing and the amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The recorded investment in PCI loans as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $183.3 million  , of which   $182.3 million   were grouped into pools and   $991 thousand   were accounted for on an individual loan basis. The recorded investment in PCI loans as of   December 31, 2015   totaled   $142.0 million  , of which   $141.2 million   were grouped into pools and   $855 thousand   were accounted for on an individual loan basis. 
    
  Due to the significance of the acquired loan portfolio and related acquisition accounting adjustments, the Company's current period credit metrics and ratios may not be comparable to those in prior periods or to credit metrics and ratios reported by other financial institutions. Specifically, (i) ALLL to total loans, (ii) ALLL to nonperforming loans, (iii) nonperforming loans to total loans, (iv) nonperforming assets to total assets, and (v) net charge-offs to average loans may not be comparable to prior periods or other financial institutions. 
  
   -   47   - 

Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.   
    
  PCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. These loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on management's ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. Since management is able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the Company's PCI loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. However, PCI loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. The past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans. 
    
  While a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered. 
    
  Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate (or foreclosed assets). Any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. Routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in non-interest expense. 
    
  Loans, excluding pooled PCI loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ) by the Company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The Company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The Company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. The Company s policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance. That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. The Company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms. 
    
  PCI loans that were classified as TDRs prior to acquisition are not classified as TDRs by the Company after the acquisition date. Subsequent modification of a PCI loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported, or accounted for, as a TDR since pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. A PCI loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a TDR if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a TDR after the acquisition date. 
    
  Other assets, including purchased accounts receivable, are characterized as nonperforming when repayment by the issuer of all amounts due is uncertain.  

-   48   - 

Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was   0.77 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.06 percent   as of   December 31, 2015   and   1.25 percent   as of   September 30, 2015  . The reduction as of   September 30, 2016   reflects the growth in total loans following the NewBridge Merger and the foreclosure of property that was securing a large commercial real estate loan during the third quarter.   
    
  Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was   1.09 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.07 percent   as of   December 31, 2015   and   1.12 percent   as of   September 30, 2015  . Acquired PCI loans that are included in loan pools are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due.  
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's nonperforming assets as of the dates presented. 

(1)    Balances include PCI loans past due 90 days or more that are grouped in pools which accrue interest based on pool yields.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming assets includes a   $7.9 million   purchased accounts receivable. As discussed in Note F, there was   no   contingency accrual related to this potential exposure as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company has discontinued its investment in purchased accounts receivable.  
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The ALLL is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. Balances are charged against the ALLL when the collectability of principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level based on management's best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis.  
    
  For non-PCI loans, the evaluation of the adequacy of ALLL includes both loans evaluated collectively for impairment and loans evaluated individually for impairment. For loans evaluated collectively for impairment, loans are grouped based on common risk characteristics which include loan type and risk grade. Historical loss rates are calculated based on the historical probability of default ("PD") and loss given default ("LGD") for each loan grouping. PDs represent the likelihood that a loan will default within a one year period of time, and LGDs represent the estimated magnitude of loss the Company will incur if a loan defaults. A loan is considered to be in default if it becomes 90 days or more past due, meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, or incurs a charge-off. Historical loss rates are developed with four years of trailing default and loss data. These historical loss rates are then combined with certain qualitative factors to determine ALLL reserve rates for each loan grouping. Qualitative factors include consideration of certain internal and external factors, such as loan delinquency levels and trends, loan growth, loan portfolio composition and concentrations, local and national economic conditions, the loan review function, and other factors management deems relevant to the ALLL calculation.  

-   49   - 

A loan, excluding PCI loans, is considered individually impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Reserves, or charge-offs, on individually impaired loans that are collateral dependent are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less an estimate of selling costs, while reserves, or charge-offs, on loans that are not collateral dependent are based on either an observable market price, if available, or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate. PCI loans within pools are not evaluated individually for impairment. 
    
  The following table presents the allocation of ALLL for the periods presented. 

The following table summarizes changes in ALLL for the periods presented. 

The ALLL to total loans ratio was   0.23 percent   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.20 percent   as of   December 31, 2015  . The higher ALLL ratio was due to origination activity. Adjusted ALLL, which includes ALLL as well as net acquisition fair value adjustments for acquired loans, declined from   2.54 percent   of total loans as of   December 31, 2015   to   1.29 percent   of total loans as of   September 30, 2016  . Changes in the ALLL and adjusted ALLL were also influenced by decreases in historical loss rates used in the ALLL model and adjustments to the ALLL model's qualitative factors.

The following non-GAAP reconciliation provides a calculation of the adjusted ALLL and the related adjusted ALLL as a percentage of total loans for the periods presented. 

Deposit Activities 
    
  Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company's lending and investing activities. The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, IRAs and CDs. These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , brokered deposits represented   13.6 percent   and   13.2 percent  , respectively, of total deposits. 
    
  Total deposits as of   September 30, 2016   were   $5.31 billion  , which was an increase of   $2.00 billion   from   December 31, 2015  . Excluding acquired NewBridge deposits, the increase in deposit balances was   $9.6 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding time deposits under $100 thousand of   $556.0 million   and   $335.3 million  , respectively, and time deposits over $100 thousand of   $841.1 million   and   $682.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  The table below provides a summary of the Company s deposit portfolio by deposit type. 

-   51   - 

The following tables summarize the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for the periods presented. 

The overall mix of deposits has shifted to a higher percentage of interest-bearing demand balances with reductions in the percentage of deposits held in time deposit accounts. The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. The average cost of deposits was   0.36 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   0.38 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , the change resulting from changes in deposit mix and rates.  
    
  Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 
    
  The Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. Short-term borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances maturing within twelve months and a structured repurchase agreement acquired from NewBridge which matures in December 2016, increased by   $416.2 million   since   December 31, 2015  . However, excluding acquired NewBridge funds, short-term borrowings decreased by   $56.1 million   as the Company used deposit growth and cash flows from the investment portfolio to reduce its borrowed funds balances.   
    
  Long-term debt decreased by   $30.8 million   since   December 31, 2015  , and, excluding acquired NewBridge obligations, long-term debt decreased by   $62.5 million  . Long-term debt includes FHLB advances maturing beyond one year, subordinated debt, junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts ("TRUPs"), and capital lease obligations. After the NewBridge Merger, the Company began the process of extending and laddering out maturities on certain acquired FHLB advances to better balance the Company's liquidity and interest rate risk profile. All NewBridge FHLB advances at acquisition were set to mature within twelve months.  
    
  Shareholders  Equity 
    
  Total shareholders  equity was   $1.01 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $451.6 million   from   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due to   $431.3 million   of net assets acquired in the NewBridge Merger,   $41.5 million   of net income earned during   2016  , and   $4.5 million   of net other comprehensive income, partially offset by   $29.3 million   of common stock dividends. 

Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity management involves the ability to fund the needs and requirements of depositors and borrowers, fund loan commitments, pay operating expenses, and ensure compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements. To ensure the Company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands, management regularly evaluates the Company's deposit mix and trends and relies on various internal analyses of its liquidity, which includes liquidity stress testing as well as short-term and long-term liquidity planning. The Company's liquidity management is governed by its liquidity policy and contingent funding plan which are both approved annually by the Board of Directors.  
  
   -   52   - 

Investment portfolio principal payments and maturities, loan principal payments, deposit growth, brokered deposit sources, available borrowings from the FHLB, and various federal funds lines from correspondent banks are the primary sources of liquidity for the Bank. The primary uses of liquidity are repayments of borrowings, deposit maturities and withdrawals, disbursements of loan proceeds, and investment purchases.  
    
  The primary sources of liquidity at the holding company are dividend distributions from the Bank. In addition, the holding company maintains a loan agreement with a correspondent bank providing for a revolving loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. Borrowings under the loan agreement accrue interest at LIBOR plus 4.0 percent. The loan agreement will expire on July 1, 2017. However, the Company may extend the maturity date by twelve months so long as it is not in default under the loan agreement. The obligations of the loan agreement are secured by, among other things, a pledge of all of the capital stock of the Bank. The primary uses of liquidity at the holding company are common stock dividends, debt payments on its subordinated debt and TRUPs, and operating expenses.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's most liquid assets (which include cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities available for sale) totaled   $1.13 billion  , which represented   15.3 percent   of total assets and   21.2 percent   of total deposits. Supplementing this on-balance sheet liquidity, the Company had available off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of secured and unsecured lines of credit from various correspondent banks which totaled   $555.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding commitments for undisbursed lines of credit and letters of credit totaled   $1.49 billion  , and standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB on the Bank's behalf totaled   $31.0 million  . Management believes that the aggregate liquidity position of the Company is sufficient to meet deposit maturities and withdrawals, borrowing commitments, loan funding requirements, and operating expenses. Core deposits (total deposits less brokered deposits), one of the Company's most stable sources of liquidity, together with common equity capital funded   $5.60 billion  , or   76 percent  , of total assets as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.43 billion   or   77 percent   of total assets as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table presents the Company's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient. The table excludes liabilities recorded where management cannot reasonably estimate the timing of any payments that may be required in connection with these liabilities.  

Capital 
    
  The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. The Company's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the Company's risk profile, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to shareholders.

The Company's and the Bank s capital amounts and ratios as of   September 30, 2016   are presented in the table below.  

On   October 19, 2016  , the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of its outstanding unrestricted common stock, payable   November 17, 2016  , to shareholders of record as of   November 10, 2016  . Similar dividends were declared and paid during the first and second quarters of 2016. Additionally, on February 15, 2016, the Company declared an extraordinary special cash dividend of $0.50 per share of its outstanding unrestricted common stock, which was paid on March 7, 2016 to shareholders of record as of February 29, 2016.  
    
  The Company's tangible book value per common share was   $12.47   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.51   as of   December 31, 2015  . Tangible common equity to tangible assets was   9.24 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   9.21 percent   as of   December 31, 2015  .

Forward-Looking Information 
  This periodic report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including without limitation, risks related to the proposed merger with F.N.B. Corporation, reduced earnings due to larger than expected credit losses in the sectors of our loan portfolio secured by real estate due to economic factors, including declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors; reduced earnings due to larger credit losses because our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; the rate of delinquencies and amount of loans charged-off; the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods; costs or difficulties related to the integration of the banks we acquired or may acquire may be greater than expected; our ability to achieve the estimated synergies from the NewBridge Acquisition and once integrated, the effects of such business combination on our future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; our ability to integrate NewBridge on our schedule and budget;     results of examinations by our regulatory authorities, including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or write down assets; the amount of our loan portfolio collateralized by real estate; our ability to maintain appropriate levels of capital; adverse changes in asset quality and resulting credit risk-related losses and expenses; increased funding costs due to market illiquidity, competition for funding, and increased regulatory requirements with regard to funding; significant increases in competitive pressure in the banking and financial services industries; changes in political conditions or the legislative or regulatory environment, including the effect of future financial reform legislation on the banking industry; general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally and especially in our primary service area, becoming less favorable than expected resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality; our ability to retain our existing customers, including our deposit relationships; changes occurring in business conditions and inflation; changes in monetary and tax policies; ability of borrowers to repay loans; risks associated with a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; changes in the assessment of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is necessary; our reliance on secondary liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and out-of-market time deposits; loss of consumer confidence and economic disruptions resulting from terrorist activities or military actions; and changes in the securities markets.

The forward-looking statements in this periodic report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of this periodic report, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  The Company intends to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk. Like many financial institutions, the Company s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company's primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in market interest rates have on earnings and capital. This goal is accomplished through the active management of the balance sheet. The goal of these activities is to structure the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities to produce stable net interest income despite changing interest rates. The Company's overall interest rate risk position is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors and guidelines established and monitored by the Bank s Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ).   
    
  To measure, monitor, and report on interest rate risk, the Company begins with two models: (1) net interest income ("NII") at risk, which measures the impact on NII over the next twelve and twenty-four months to immediate changes in interest rates and (2) net economic value of equity ("EVE"), which measures the impact on the present value of net assets to immediate changes in interest rates. NII at risk is designed to measure the potential short-term impact of changes in interest rates on NII. EVE is a long-term measure of interest rate risk to the Company's balance sheet, or equity. Gap analysis, which is the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period, is used as a secondary measure of the Company's interest rate risk position. All of these models are subject to ALCO guidelines and are monitored regularly. 

-   55   - 

In calculating NII at risk, the Company begins with a base amount of NII that is projected over the next twelve and twenty-four months, assuming that the balance sheet is static and the yield curve remains unchanged over the period. The current yield curve is then  shocked,  or moved immediately,  1.0 percent,  2.0 percent,  3.0 percent and  4.0 percent in a parallel fashion, or at all points along the yield curve. New twelve-month and twenty four-month NII projections are then developed using the same balance sheet but with the new yield curves, and these results are compared to the base scenario. The Company also models other scenarios to evaluate potential NII at risk such as a gradual ramp in interest rates, a flattening yield curve, a steepening yield curve, and others that management deems appropriate. 
    
  EVE at risk is based on the change in the present value of all assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios. The present value of existing cash flows with the current yield curve serves as the base case. The Company then applies an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of  1.0 percent,  2.0 percent,  3.0 percent and  4.0 percent and recalculates the cash flows and related present values. 
    
  Key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows, the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in market conditions, and interest-rate sensitivities of the Company's non-maturity deposits with respect to  interest rates paid and the level of balances. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely calculate future NII or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on NII and EVE. Actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions, changes in spreads and management strategies, among other factors. Projections of NII are assessed as part of the Company's forecasting process. 
    
  NII and EVE Analysis.    The following table presents the estimated exposure to NII for the next twelve months due to immediate changes in interest rates and the estimated exposure to EVE due to immediate changes in interest rates. All information is presented as of   September 30, 2016  . 

While the measures presented in the table above are not a prediction of future NII or EVE valuations, they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant, immediate increases in interest rates at all points on the yield curve may produce higher NII in the short term. Other important factors that impact the levels of NII are balance sheet size and mix, interest rate spreads, the slope of the yield curve, the speed of interest rates changes, and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

Part II.  Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company and Yadkin Bank have been named defendants in legal actions arising from normal business activities in which damages in various amounts are claimed. Although the amount of any unrecorded liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any additional liability arising from these matters will not have a material effect on Yadkin's consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  
    
  The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties unknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Additionally, factors related to the proposed merger with F.N.B. Corporation and damage resulting from Hurricane Matthew could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
    
  Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the FNB Merger. 
    
  Before the FNB Merger and the FNB Bank Merger may be completed, Yadkin and FNB must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse development in either party s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain or a delay in receiving their approval. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the FNB Merger or the FNB Bank Merger or require changes to the terms of the FNB Merger or the FNB Bank Merger. Such conditions or changes could delay or prevent completion of the FNB Merger or the FNB Bank Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the FNB Merger and the FNB Bank Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the FNB Merger.  
    
  Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. 
    
  Yadkin and FNB have operated and, until the completion of the FNB Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of the FNB Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on FNB s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of FNB and Yadkin in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the FNB Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Yadkin s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on Yadkin s financial results and the value of the Yadkin common stock. If FNB experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the FNB Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause FNB and/or Yadkin to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from FNB and/or Yadkin and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. In addition, the actual cost savings of the FNB Merger could be less than anticipated. 

-   57   - 

The FNB Merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the FNB Merger not being completed. Termination of the FNB Merger Agreement could negatively impact Yadkin. 
    
  The FNB Merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and adoption of the FNB Merger by Yadkin shareholders. If any condition to the FNB Merger is not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, including the absence of any materially burdensome condition in the regulatory approvals, the FNB Merger will not be completed. In addition, either FNB or Yadkin may terminate the FNB Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even if the FNB Merger is adopted by the Yadkin shareholders, including but not limited to, if the FNB Merger has not been completed on or before May 31, 2017. 
    
  If the FNB Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, Yadkin s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the FNB Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the FNB Merger. Additionally, if the FNB Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of Yadkin s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the FNB Merger will be completed.  
    
  FNB and Yadkin will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the FNB Merger is pending. 
    
  The FNB Merger Agreement restricts Yadkin from operating its business other than in the ordinary course and prohibits Yadkin from taking specified actions without FNB s consent until the FNB Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent Yadkin from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the FNB Merger. In addition, uncertainty  about the effect of the FNB Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Yadkin. These uncertainties may impair Yadkin s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the FNB Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Yadkin to seek to change existing business relationships with Yadkin. Retention of certain employees by Yadkin may be challenging while the FNB Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Yadkin. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Yadkin, Yadkin s business could be harmed.  
    
  The uncertainty caused by the pending FNB Merger could cause Yadkin s clients and business associates to seek to change their existing business relationships with Yadkin. These uncertainties may impair Yadkin s ability to attract, retain and grow Yadkin s client base until the FNB Merger is complete. 
    
  The market value of the merger consideration that Yadkin shareholders will receive as a result of the FNB Merger may fluctuate. 
    
  If the FNB Merger is completed, each share of the Yadkin common stock will be converted into the right to receive 2.16 shares of FNB common stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares.     The market value of the merger consideration may vary from the closing price of FNB common stock on the date the FNB Merger was announced, on the date that the proxy statement/prospectus is mailed to the Yadkin shareholders, on the date of the special meeting of the Yadkin shareholders, on the date the FNB Merger is consummated and thereafter. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the respective businesses, operations and prospects, and the regulatory situation of FNB and Yadkin. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Yadkin. Any change in the market price of FNB common stock prior to completion of the FNB Merger will affect the amount of and the market value of the merger consideration that Yadkin shareholders will receive upon completion of the FNB Merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, the Yadkin shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the amount or the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the FNB Merger. 
    
  Further, the results of operations of the combined company following the FNB Merger and the market price of the combined company s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of FNB and Yadkin. 
    
  If the FNB Merger is not completed, Yadkin will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the FNB Merger. 
    
  Yadkin has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the FNB Merger Agreement, including a portion of the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the FNB Merger.  If the FNB Merger is not completed, Yadkin would have to recognize its portion of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the FNB Merger. 
  
   -   58   - 

The FNB Merger Agreement limits Yadkin s ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal and could require Yadkin to pay a termination fee of $45 million under certain circumstances relating to alternative acquisition proposals. 
    
  The FNB Merger Agreement prohibits Yadkin from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging certain alternative acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the FNB Merger Agreement. The FNB Merger Agreement also provides for the payment by Yadkin to FNB of a termination fee in the amount of $45 million (and, in some cases, FNB s documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the FNB Merger) in the event that Yadkin or FNB terminates the FNB Merger Agreement for certain specified reasons. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Yadkin from considering or proposing such an acquisition.  
    
  Damage resulting from Hurricane Matthew could have a negative impact on the Company's credit risk.  
    
  Many communities in Southern and Eastern North Carolina suffered significant damage resulting from Hurricane Matthew. At this time, it is unclear to what extent Yadkin customers have been affected by uninsured business interruption, property destruction and other related losses, and how those events may affect each customer's ability to meet its debt service obligations.
