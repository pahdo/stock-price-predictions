[***] INDICATES MATERIAL THAT WAS OMITTED AND FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT WAS REQUESTED. ALL SUCH OMITTED MATERIAL WAS FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company has all requisite power and authority under all applicable laws, rules, regulations and governing documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements, and Savant has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce the Transaction Agreements against the Company, (ii) each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Transaction Agreements, (iii) each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements is validly existing and in good standing in all necessary jurisdictions (except for the Company in the State of Delaware to the extent stated in paragraph (a) below), (iv) each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes a valid and binding obligation, enforceable against Savant in accordance with its terms, (v) there has been no mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, or fraud, duress or undue influence, in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of each of the Transaction Agreements, and the conduct of all parties to the Transaction Agreements has complied with any requirements of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability, and (vi) there are and have been no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is and has been no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties (and no act or omission of any party),  that would, in any such case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of any of the Transaction Agreements, and legally sufficient consideration has been given and received for the transactions covered by each of the Transaction Agreements and for the obligations of each of the parties thereunder.  We have also assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter, as well as the Confirmation Order (as defined below). 

This opinion letter is based as to matters of law, subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, solely on applicable provisions of the following, as currently in effect: (i) as to the opinions expressed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), the Delaware General Corporation Law, (ii) as to the opinions expressed in paragraphs (c) and (d), (i) applicable provisions of internal Delaware state law, (ii) the United States Bankruptcy Code, (iii) the Company s Second Amended Plan of Reorganization, dated May 9, 2016 (the  Plan ), and (iv) the Confirmation Order entered in the pending Chapter 11 case entitled In re Kalobios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Case No. 15-12628 (LSS) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

Based upon, subject to and limited by the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions, and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, we are of the opinion that:

(a)            The Company is validly existing as a corporation and in good standing as of the date of the Good Standing Certificate under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

(b)            The Company has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform each of the Transaction Agreements. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each of the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company.

(c)            Each of the Transaction Agreements has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. 

(d)            Each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company , enforceable by Savant against the Company in accordance with its terms.   

The opinion expressed in paragraph (d) above shall be understood to mean only that if there is a default in performance of an obligation, (i) if a failure to pay or other damage can be shown and (ii) if the defaulting party can be brought into a court which will hear the case and apply the governing law, then, subject to the availability of defenses, and to the exceptions elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, the court will provide a money damage (or perhaps injunctive or specific performance) remedy. 

In addition to the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions and limitations elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, our opinions expressed above are also subject to the effect of:  (1)  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory and other law regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers) with respect to any future bankruptcy (or similar circumstance) of the Company; and (2) the exercise of judicial discretion and the application of principles of equity, good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, conscionability and materiality (regardless of whether the applicable agreements are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 

We express no opinion in this letter as to any other statutes, rules and regulations not specifically identified above as being covered hereby (and in particular, we express no opinion as to any effect that such other statutes, rules and regulations may have on the opinions expressed herein).  We express no opinion in this letter as to securities statutes, rules or regulations (and in particular, we express no opinion with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant), antitrust, unfair competition, banking or tax statutes, rules or regulations, or statutes, rules or regulations of any political subdivision below the state level.   We express no opinion in this letter as to  creation, attachment, perfection or priority  of any security interest on any collateral pursuant to the Security Agreement.  The opinions set forth in paragraphs (a) above are based upon a review of only those statutes, rules and regulations (not otherwise excluded in this letter) that, in our experience, are generally recognized as applicable to transactions of the type covered by the Agreement and to the role of the Company in such transactions.    

We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.  This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the closing under the Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, and should not be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without the prior written consent of this firm.

(b)              Exercise  .  The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder, in whole or in part (to the extent exercisable), at any time or times on or after the applicable Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to KaloBios (or such other office or agency of KaloBios as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of KaloBios) of a duly executed facsimile copy (or e-mail attachment) of the Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A   and, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares specified in the Notice of Exercise within two (2) Business Days following delivery of the Notice of Exercise to KaloBios by wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Exercise Price for the shares specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise, or, if available and specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise, pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in   Section 2(c)   below.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to KaloBios until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall promptly surrender this Warrant to KaloBios for cancellation after the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to KaloBios. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and KaloBios shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. KaloBios shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof . 

(c)              Cashless Exercise  . If at the time of exercise hereof there is no effective registration statement registering the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder,  provided , that the Holder has cooperated with KaloBios  reasonable requests in connection with KaloBios  efforts to register such resale, and  provided ,  further , that the No-Action Letter has not been issued, then this Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a  cashless exercise  in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where: 

(A) = 
  the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of   Common Stock on the date of the Notice of Exercise;  

(B) = 
 the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and 

(X) = 
 the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.

If Warrant Shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Act, the Warrant Shares shall take on the characteristics of the Warrants being exercised and the holding period of the Warrant Shares being issued may be tacked on to the holding period of the Warrant.   KaloBios  agrees not to take any position contrary to this    Section 2(c)   , subject to any change in applicable Law. 

(d)              Fair Market Value  .   Fair Market Value  of one (1) share of KaloBios  Common Stock shall mean for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies:

(based on a trading day from 9:30 a.m. (New York City time) to 4:02 p.m. (New York City time)); 

(ii)            if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted on a  national  securities exchange but is listed or quoted for trading on OTCQB or OCTQX, the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date ( or the nearest preceding date on which there were sales of the Common Stock ) on OTCQB or OTCQX, as applicable ;  

(iii)            if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted for trading on OTCQB or OTCQX and if prices for the Common Stock are then reported in the  Pink Sheets  published by OTC Markets Group Inc. (or a similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported; 

(iv)             the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith by  KaloBios  and reasonably acceptable to the Holder, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by KaloBios.

(e)              Mechanics of Exercise  . 

(i)             Delivery of Warrant Shares upon Exercise .  KaloBios shall cause the Warrant Shares purchased hereunder to be transmitted to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s or its designee s balance account with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system if KaloBios is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by Holder, (B) this Warrant is being exercised via cashless exercise, (C) this Warrant is being exercised by the Holder and the underlying Warrant Shares are being sold pursuant to Rule 144 adopted under the Act (  Rule 144  ) or (D) the shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in KaloBios  share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is three (3) Business Days after the delivery to KaloBios of the Notice of Exercise (the   Warrant Share Delivery Date    provided , under no circumstances is KaloBios required to cause the Warrant Shares to be delivered prior to payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in the case of cashless exercise).  Upon delivery of the Notice of Exercise and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price within two Business Days after delivery of the Notice of Exercise (other than in the case of cashless exercise), the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to be the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Shares.  If KaloBios fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date and the applicable aggregate Exercise Price has been delivered, KaloBios shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10.00 per Business Day for each Business Day after the first Business Day following such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or the Holder rescinds such exercise. 

(ii)             Delivery of New Warrants upon Exercise .  If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, KaloBios shall, at the request of the Holder set forth in the Notice of Exercise and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

(iii)             Rescission Rights .  If KaloBios fails to deliver, or cause the delivery to the Holder of the Warrant Shares pursuant to   Section 2(d)(ii)   by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise. 

Section 3              Certain Adjustments  .   The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows:

(a)              Change of Control or Reclassification  .   In case of (i) any  Change of Control of KaloBios or (ii) any reclassification of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (other than a change (A) in par value, (B) from par value to no par value, (C) from no par value to par value or (D) as a result of a subdivision or combination) , KaloBios, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall duly execute and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder), or KaloBios shall make appropriate provision without the issuance of a new Warrant, so that Holder shall have the right to receive, at a total purchase price not to exceed that payable upon the exercise of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, and in lieu of the Warrant Shares theretofore issuable upon exercise or conversion of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification, change, merger or sale by a holder of the number of shares of   Common Stock then purchasable under this Warrant, or in the case of such a merger or sale in which the consideration paid consists all or in part of assets other than securities of the successor or purchasing corporation, at the option of Holder, the securities of the successor or purchasing corporation having a value at the time of the transaction equivalent to the value of the Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the transaction.  Any new Warrant shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this    Section 3   .  In the event of a Change of Control, the Exercise Dates shall be accelerated and all purchase rights with respect to all Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant (to the extent not previously exercised) shall become exercisable no later than immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control.  The provisions of this    Section 3(a)    shall similarly apply to successive Changes of Control or reclassifications. Prior to the closing of any Change of Control in which KaloBios will not be the surviving entity,  KaloBios  shall, unless the Holder requests otherwise, cause the surviving or successor entity to assume this Warrant and the obligations of  KaloBios  hereunder.  

(b)              Stock Dividends and Splits  . If KaloBios, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by KaloBios upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of KaloBios, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged, subject to the limitation on the issuance of fractional shares contained in   Section 9(b)  .  Any adjustment made pursuant to this   Section 3(b)   shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

(c)              Adjustment of Number of Shares   .  Upon each adjustment in the Exercise Price, the number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to the product obtained by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment in the Exercise Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price immediately thereafter.

(d)              Calculations  . All calculations under this   Section 3   shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this   Section 3  , the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

(e)              Notice to the Holder  .   Whenever any Exercise Price or the kind or number of securities issuable under this Warrant shall be adjusted pursuant to    Section 3    hereof, KaloBios shall promptly deliver to the Holder in accordance with    Section 9(h)    a certificate signed by an officer of KaloBios setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated, and the Exercise Price and number or kind of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant after giving effect to such adjustment.  KaloBios  shall provide the Holder with written notice of any proposed Change of Control of KaloBios not later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the closing of such Change of Control setting forth the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall also provide the Holder such other information respecting such proposed Change of Control as may reasonably be requested by the Holder.  

Section 4              Transfer of Warrant  .   In connection with any transfer by the Holder of this Warrant, KaloBios may require the transferee to provide KaloBios with written representations and warranties that the transferee is acquiring this Warrant and the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise for investment purposes only and not with a view to any sale or distribution, if such transfer occurs prior to the issuance of the No-Action Letter, and may require a legal opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to KaloBios and its counsel, stating that such transfer is exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Act;   provided, however  , that no opinion shall be required from the Holder in the event that such transfer (i) occurs upon or after the issuance of the No-Action Letter, (ii) is to an Affiliate of the Holder, or (iii) results in a mere change in the form of beneficial ownership of this Warrant;   provided, further  ,     in the case of (ii) and (iii), that the Holder provides a representation letter representing that the transferee is an Affiliate of the Holder or that such transfer will result in a mere change in the form of beneficial ownership of this Warrant, as applicable.  Following any transfer of this Warrant, at the request of either KaloBios or the transferee, the transferee shall surrender this Warrant to KaloBios in exchange for a new warrant of like tenor and date, executed by KaloBios.  Upon any partial transfer, KaloBios will also execute and deliver to the Holder a new warrant of like tenor with respect to the portion of this Warrant not so transferred.  Subject to the foregoing, this Warrant is transferable on the books of KaloBios at its principal office by the registered the Holder hereof upon surrender of this Warrant properly endorsed.

(b)              Valid Issuance of Warrant and Warrant Shares  .  This Warrant has been validly issued and is free of restrictions on transfer other than restrictions on transfer set forth herein and under applicable state and federal securities laws.  The Warrant Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance in accordance with the terms hereof including the payment by the Holder of the full Exercise Price, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and be free of restrictions on transfer other than restrictions on transfer under this Warrant and under applicable state and federal securities laws.

If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of the Warrant Shares shall not be sufficient for the full exercise of this Warrant, then in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the Holder, KaloBios shall as soon as reasonably practicable take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

The offer, sale and issuance of the Warrant Shares, as contemplated by this Warrant, are exempt from the prospectus and registration requirements of applicable United States federal and state security laws, and neither KaloBios nor any authorized agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action hereafter that would cause the loss of such exemption.

 ESCROW AGENT S LIABILITY 

(a)            Escrow Agent shall not be liable for actions or omissions hereunder, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable judgment that Escrow Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any liability or loss to Escrow Agent.  Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash held by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of the Escrow Funds or any loss of interest incident to any such delays.

(b)            If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

 INDEMNIFICATION 

From and at all times after the date of this Escrow Agreement, KaloBios shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the    Indemnified Parties   ) against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without limitation reasonable attorneys  fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any person, including without limitation any of the Parties, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of this Escrow Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal, to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party.  Indemnified Parties shall, in their sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by the Parties; provided, however that the Parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees of counsel of more than one separate firm (plus, if required, one separate firm admitted to practice in a local jurisdiction) at any one time retained by Indemnified Parties unless the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the Parties.  The obligations of the Parties under this   Section 6(a)   shall survive any termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

(a)            Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the service thereof.  Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.  Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of each Party has full power and authority to instruct Escrow Agent on behalf of such Party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to Escrow Agent by such Party.  Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with final orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow Amount, without determination by Escrow Agent of such court s jurisdiction in the matter.

 RESIGNATION 

Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time resign as such by delivering the Escrow Funds to any successor Escrow Agent designated by the Parties in writing, or to any court of competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this Escrow Agreement.  The resignation of Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of (i) the appointment of a successor (including a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii) the day which is thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of its written notice of resignation to the Parties.  If, at that time, Escrow Agent has not received a designation of a successor Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent s sole responsibility after that time shall be to retain (without any obligation to reinvest the same) the Escrow Funds until receipt of a designation of successor Escrow Agent or a court order appointing a successor Escrow Agent as set forth below.  The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation and to cause such successor Escrow Agent to execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment.  The resigning Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the resigning Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and payment to the resigning Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys  fees) due and owing to the resigning Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.  If the Parties have failed to appoint a successor Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice of resignation, Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.  After any resigning Escrow Agent s resignation, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement.  Any corporation or association into which Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow business of Escrow Agent s corporate trust line of business may be transferred, shall be Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

15. 
 OWNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES 

KaloBios agrees that, for purposes of federal and other taxes based on income, KaloBios will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Funds and that KaloBios will report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Funds as its income in the taxable year or years in which such income is actually received by KaloBios and pay any taxes attributable thereto.  KaloBios represents that its Taxpayer Identification Number (   TIN   ) assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (   IRS   ) or any other taxing authority listed on   Schedule D   is true and correct, and that it will notify Escrow Agent in writing immediately upon any change to such number.  Taxes may be withheld by Escrow Agent as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at the time of the distribution.  In the absence of written direction from KaloBios, all proceeds of the Escrow Funds, if any, shall be retained as Escrow Funds. KaloBios grants to Escrow Agent a right of set-off which may be exercised to pay any and all taxes, whether federal, state or local, incurred by the investment of the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. KaloBios shall indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent against and in respect to liability for taxes and/or any penalties or interest attributable to the investment of Escrow Funds by Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement.

The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent.

The parties hereto are aware that under applicable state law, property which is presumed abandoned may under certain circumstances escheat to the applicable state.  Escrow Agent shall have no liability to any Party, its respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, or any other party, should any or all of the Escrow Funds and any proceeds thereof escheat by operation of law.
