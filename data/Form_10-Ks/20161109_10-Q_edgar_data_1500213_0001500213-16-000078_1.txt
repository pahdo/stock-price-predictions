NOTE 1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Nature of Business 
  SI Financial Group, Inc. (the  Company ) is the holding company for Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company (the  Bank ).  Established in   1842  , the Bank is a community-oriented financial institution headquartered in Willimantic, Connecticut.  The Bank provides a variety of financial services to individuals, businesses and municipalities through its   25   offices in eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island.  Its primary products include savings, checking and certificate of deposit accounts, residential and commercial mortgage loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans.  In addition, wealth management services, which include trust, financial planning, life insurance and investment services, are offered to individuals and businesses through the Bank s offices.  The Company does not conduct any material business other than owning all of the stock of the Bank and making payments on the subordinated debentures held by the Company. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, SI Mortgage Company and SI Realty Company, Inc.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
  The interim consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10.01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and general practices within the banking industry.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements have been omitted.  Information in the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements of the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is unaudited.  These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in the Company s Form 10-K. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all of the adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods covered herein.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other period.  
    
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the balance sheets and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, deferred income taxes and the impairment of long-lived assets. 
    
  Reclassifications 
  Amounts in the Company s prior year consolidated financial statements are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Such reclassifications have no effect on net income.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 

Loans Receivable 
  Loans receivable are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred loan origination fees and costs.  Management has the ability and intent to hold its loans receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off. 
    
  A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.  Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for residential and commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.  Accordingly, the Company does not typically identify individual consumer loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") agreement. 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  The Company periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans.  When a loan is modified and concessions have been made to the original contractual terms that would not otherwise be considered for a borrower with similar risk characteristics, such as reductions of interest rates, deferral of interest or principal payments, or maturity extensions due to the borrower s financial condition, the modification is considered a TDR.  Modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower.  If the modification agreement is violated, the loan is handled by the Company s Collections Department for resolution, which may result in foreclosure. 
    
  Management considers all nonaccrual loans, with the exception of certain consumer loans, to be impaired.  Also, all TDRs are initially classified as impaired and follow the Company's nonaccrual policy.  If the loan was current prior to modification, nonaccrual status would not be required.  If the loan was on nonaccrual prior to modification or if the payment amount significantly increases, the loan will remain on nonaccrual for a period of at least six months.  Loans qualify for return to accrual status once the borrower has demonstrated the willingness and the ability to perform in accordance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a period of not less than six consecutive months.  In most cases, loan payments less than 90 days past due are considered minor collection delays and the related loans are generally not considered impaired. 
    
  Impaired classification may be removed after a year following the restructure if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms and the restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar risk characteristics at the time of restructuring. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses, a material estimate which could change significantly in the near-term, is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings to account for losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio and estimated to occur, and is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of the principal loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses when received.  In the determination of the allowance for loan losses, management may obtain independent appraisals for significant properties, when necessary. 
    
  Management's judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a monthly basis by management and is based on the evaluation of the known and

     Table of Contents   
  SI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 

inherent risk characteristics and size and composition of the loan portfolio, the assessment of current economic and real estate market conditions, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, historical loan loss experience, the amount and trends of nonperforming loans, delinquencies, classified assets and loan charge-offs and evaluations of loans and other relevant factors. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses consists of the following key elements: 

Specific allowance for identified impaired loans  .  For loans identified as impaired, an allowance is established when the present value of expected cash flows (or observable market price of the loan or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 

General valuation allowance.    The general component represents a valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio, after excluding impaired loans.  For this portion of the allowance, loans are segregated by category and assigned an allowance percentage based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments: residential one- to four-family, multi-family and commercial real estate, construction, commercial business and consumer.  Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on the time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment.  This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and in the terms of the loans; changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the amount of nonaccrual loans and the amount and severity of adversely classified or graded loans; changes in the quality of the loan review system; changes in the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the portfolio.  
       
  The qualitative factors are determined based on the following various risk characteristics for each loan segment.  Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows: 

Residential   One to Four Family     The Bank primarily originates conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios less than 95% and generally originates loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% only when secured by first liens on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences.  Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally require private mortgage insurance or additional collateral.  All loans in this segment are collateralized by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.  The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality of this segment. 

Multi-family and Commercial     Loans in this segment are originated to acquire, develop, improve or refinance multi-family and commercial real estate where the property is the primary collateral securing the loan, and the income generated from the property is the primary repayment source.  The underlying cash flows generated by the properties can be impacted by the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates.  Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on the successful operation and management of the properties.  Management continually monitors the cash flows of these loans. 

Construction     This segment includes loans to individuals and, to a lesser extent, builders to finance the construction of residential dwellings.  The Bank also originates construction loans for commercial

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 

development projects.  Upon the completion of construction, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan.  Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, correct estimates of the sale price of the property, time to sell at an adequate price and market conditions. 

Commercial Business     Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business.  Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business.  A weakened economy and reduced viability of the industry in which the customer operates will have a negative impact on the credit quality in this segment.  The Bank provides loans to investors in the time share industry, which are secured by consumer receivables, and provides loans for capital improvements to condominium associations, which are secured by the assigned rights to levy special assessments to condominium owners.  Additionally, the Bank purchases medical loans primarily out of our market area from a company specializing in medical loan originations, which are secured by medical equipment. 

Consumer     Loans in this segment primarily include home equity lines of credit (representing both first and second liens), indirect automobile loans and, to a lesser extent, loans secured by marketable securities, passbook or certificate accounts, motorcycles, automobiles and recreational vehicles, as well as unsecured loans.  Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. 
       
  In computing the allowance for loan losses, we do not assign a general valuation allowance to the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) and United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) loans that we purchase as such loans are fully guaranteed.  These loans are included in commercial business loans.    See Note 4 for details  .  
    
  The majority of the Company's loans are collateralized by real estate located in eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island.  To a lesser extent, certain commercial real estate loans are secured by collateral located outside of our primary market area with concentrations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  Accordingly, the collateral value of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio and real estate acquired through foreclosure is susceptible to changes in local market conditions. 
    
  Although management believes it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and the Company s results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.  Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with GAAP, our regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, may request us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours.  In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.  Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Interest and Fees on Loans 
  Interest on loans is accrued and included in net interest income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding.  Accrual of interest is discontinued when loan payments are 90 days or more past due, based on contractual terms, or when, in the judgment of management, collectibility of the loan or loan interest becomes uncertain.  Subsequent recognition of income occurs only to the extent payment is received subject to management's assessment of the collectibility of the remaining interest and principal.  A nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status when it is no longer delinquent and collectibility of interest and principal is no longer in doubt and the borrower has made regular payments in accordance with the terms of the loan over a period of at least six months.  Interest collected on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent cash payments are

received, and may be recorded as a reduction to principal if the collectibility of the principal balance of the loan is unlikely. 
    
  Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs and loan purchase premiums are deferred, and the net amount is recognized as an adjustment of the related loan's yield utilizing the interest method over the contractual life of the loan.  In addition, discounts related to fair value adjustments for loans receivable acquired in a business combination or asset purchase are accreted into earnings over the contractual term as an adjustment of the related loan's yield.  The Company periodically evaluates the cash flows expected to be collected for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.  Changes in the expected cash flows compared to the expected cash flows as of the date of acquisition may impact the accretable yield or result in a charge to the provision for loan losses to the extent of a shortfall. 
    
  Common Share Repurchases 
  The Company is chartered in the state of Maryland.  Maryland law does not provide for treasury shares, rather shares repurchased by the Company constitute authorized but unissued shares.  GAAP states that accounting for treasury stock shall conform to state law.  Therefore, the cost of shares repurchased by the Company is allocated to common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings balances. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) -   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance that improves the revenue recognition requirements for contracts with customers.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  To achieve the core principle, a company should apply a five step approach to revenue recognition.  In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date for this guidance for one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and we do not expect this to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs -   In April 2015, FASB issued guidance simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.  The amended guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The amended guidance was applied on a retrospective basis and effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, that began after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of the amended guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements -   In August 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force meeting that the update issued in April 2015 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  Given the absence of authoritative guidance within the previous update for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit-arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there were any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The adoption of the amended guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10):    In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance addressing certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  Targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles include the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted

for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and the elimination of the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Leases (Topic 842):    In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Disclosures are required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still reviewing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):    In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences of such transactions.  Under the provisions of the update, the income tax consequences of excess tax benefits and deficiencies should be recognized in income tax expense in the reporting period in which the awards vest.  Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies impact shareholders' equity directly to the extent there is a cumulative excess tax benefit.  In the event that a tax deficiency has occurred during the reporting period and a cumulative tax benefit does not exist, the tax deficiency is recognized in income tax expense under current GAAP.  The update also provides entities may continue to estimate forfeitures in accounting for stock based compensation or recognize them as they occur.  The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The update requires a modified retrospective transition under which cumulative effect to equity will be recognized in the period of adoption.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):    In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income.  The update will replace today's "incurred loss" approach with an "expected loss" model.  The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model, will apply to (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.  This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees.  The CECL model does not apply to available for sale ("AFS") debt securities.  For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current accounting guidance, except that losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.  The update also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.  Disclosure requirements under the update have been expanded to include the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses.  In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by year of origination.  The update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The update

requires a modified retrospective transition under which a cumulative effect to equity will be recognized in the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230):    In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  This update provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.  The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 2.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Unvested restricted shares are considered outstanding in the computation of basic earnings per share since the shares participate in dividends and the rights to the dividends are non-forfeitable.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner similar to basic earnings per share except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the incremental common shares (as computed using the treasury stock method) that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were issued during the period.  The Company s common stock equivalents relate solely to stock options.  Repurchased common shares and unallocated common shares held by the Bank s ESOP are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. 
    
  Anti-dilutive shares are common stock equivalents with weighted average exercise prices in excess of the weighted average market value for the periods presented, and are not considered in diluted earnings per share calculations.  The Company had anti-dilutive common shares outstanding of   157,391   and   153,391   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   321,793   and   342,819   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
    
  The computation of earnings per share is as follows:

At   September 30, 2016  ,   36   debt securities with gross unrealized losses had aggregate depreciation of   1.10%   of the Company s amortized cost basis.  The unrealized losses are primarily related to the Company s U.S. Government and agency obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities.  There were no investments deemed other-than-temporarily impaired for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The following summarizes, by security type, the basis for management s determination during the preparation of the financial statements of whether the applicable investments within the Company s securities portfolio were not other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  U.S. Government and Agency Obligations and Mortgage-backed Securities - Agency - Residential.    The unrealized losses on the Company s U.S. Government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed agency-residential securities related primarily to a widening of the rate spread to comparable treasury securities.  The Company does not expect these securities to settle at a price less than the par value of the securities.   
    
  Mortgage-backed Securities - Non-agency - Residential.      The unrealized losses on the Company's non-agency-residential mortgage-backed securities relate to one investment which has been evaluated by management and no potential credit loss was identified.  
    
  Collateralized Debt Obligation.      The unrealized loss on the Company's collateralized debt obligation relates to one investment in a pooled trust preferred security ("PTPS") which management does not believe will suffer from any credit-related losses, based on its senior credit profile.  The unrealized loss on this security is caused by the low interest rate environment as this security reprices quarterly to the three-month LIBOR and market spreads on similar newly issued securities have increased.

The Company reviews and establishes, if necessary, an allowance for certain impaired loans for the amount by which the present value of expected cash flows (or observable market price of loan or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent) are lower than the carrying value of the loan.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company concluded that certain impaired loans required no valuation allowance as a result of management s measurement of impairment.  No additional funds are advanced to those borrowers whose loans are deemed impaired without prior approval of the Loan Committee or the Board of Directors.

Credit Quality Information 
  The Company utilizes an eight-grade internal loan rating system for all loans in the portfolio, with the exception of its purchased SBA and USDA commercial business loans that are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government, as follows: 
                 o 
    Pass (Ratings 1-4):   Loans in these categories are considered low to average risk. 

o 
    Special Mention (Rating 5):   Loans in this category are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management.

o 
    Substandard (Rating 6):   Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged.  There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected. 

o 
    Doubtful (Rating 7):   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 

o 
    Loss (Rating 8):   Loans in this category are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. 

Management periodically reviews the ratings described above and the Company s internal audit function reviews components of the credit files, including the assigned risk ratings, of certain commercial loans as part of its loan review.

NOTE 7.  REGULATORY CAPITAL 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies.  Failure by the Company or the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  The following tables present regulatory capital information for the Company and the Bank.  Under Basel III capital requirements, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s and the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Company s and the Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation require the Company and the Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios.  Federal bank regulators require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of core capital to adjusted average assets, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject and were  well capitalized  under the regulatory requirements.  To be  well capitalized,  the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%,

6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively.  Management believes no conditions or events have occurred since   September 30, 2016   that would materially adversely change the Company s and the Bank s capital classifications.  

Effective January 1, 2016, Basel III implemented a requirement for all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital.  The capital conservation buffer increases the three risk-based capital ratios by 0.625% each year through 2019, at which point, the minimum common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios will be 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.  Also, certain new deductions from, and adjustments to, regulatory capital will be phased in over several years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank complied with the capital conservation buffer requirement.

NOTE 8.  FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
  The Company groups its assets and liabilities in three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.  Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of a reporting period, if applicable.  
    
           Level 1: 
    Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market.  Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 2:  
    Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 3: 
    Valuation is based on unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.         
       
  Determination of Fair Value 
  The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  The fair value of assets and liabilities is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices.  However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various assets and liabilities.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the assets and liabilities. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures of its financial instruments: 

Cash and cash equivalents.      The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair values based on the short-term nature of the assets. 

Securities available for sale.      Included in the available for sale category are debt securities.  The securities measured at fair value in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in an active exchange market.  Securities measured at fair value in Level 2 are based on pricing models that consider standard input factors such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, credit spreads and new issue data.  The Company utilizes a nationally-recognized third-party pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for the majority of its portfolio.  The pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information considering observable data, but these prices do not represent binding quotes.  The fair value prices on all investments are reviewed for reasonableness by management.  Securities measured at fair value in Level 3 include one collateralized debt obligation that was backed by a trust preferred security issued by banks and insurance companies.  Management determined that an orderly and active market for this security and similar securities did not exist based on

a significant reduction in trading volume and widening spreads relative to historical levels.  The Company estimates future cash flows discounted using a rate management believes is representative of current market conditions.  Factors in determining the discount rate include the current level of deferrals and/or defaults, changes in credit rating and the financial condition of the debtors within the underlying securities, broker quotes for securities with similar structure and credit risk, interest rate movements and pricing for new issuances. 

Federal Home Loan Bank stock.      The carrying value of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the FHLB. 

Federal Reserve Bank stock.      The carrying value of Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the FRB. 

Loans held for sale.      The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated using quoted market prices. 

Loans receivable.      For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.  The fair value of fixed-rate loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates at the end of the period in which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  Fair values for nonperforming loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or underlying collateral values, where applicable. 

Accrued interest receivable.      The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. 

Deposits.      The fair value of demand deposits, negotiable orders of withdrawal, regular savings, certain money market deposits and mortgagors  and investors  escrow accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  The fair value of certificates of deposit and other time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected maturities on such deposits. 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances.      The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current FHLB interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. 

Junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trust.      Rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt. 

Interest rate swap agreement.      The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap is obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative.  The pricing analysis is based on observable inputs for the contractual term of the derivative, including the period to maturity, credit component and interest rate curves. 

Forward loan sale commitments and derivative loan commitments.      Forward loan sale commitments and derivative loan commitments are based on the fair values of the underlying mortgage loans, including the servicing rights for derivative loan commitments, and the probability of such commitments being exercised.  Significant management judgment and estimation is required in determining these fair value measurements.

Off-balance sheet instruments.      Fair values for off-balance sheet lending commitments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standings.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  The Company may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.  The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related individual assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The following table summarizes losses (gains) resulting from fair value adjustments for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

The Company measures the impairment of loans that are collateral dependent based on the fair value of the collateral (Level 3).  The fair value of collateral used by the Company represents the amount expected to be received from the sale of the property, net of selling costs, as determined by an independent, licensed or certified appraiser using observable market data.  This data includes information such as selling price of similar properties, expected future cash flows or earnings of the subject property based on current market expectations, and relevant legal, physical and economic factors.  The appraised values of collateral are adjusted as necessary by management based on observable inputs for specific properties.  Losses applicable to write-downs of impaired loans are based on the appraised market value of the underlying collateral, assuming foreclosure of these loans is imminent, and are recorded through the provision for loan losses. 
    
  The amount of other real estate owned represents the carrying value of the collateral based on the appraised value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.  The loss on foreclosed assets represents adjustments in the valuation recorded during the time period indicated and not for losses incurred on sales.

Summary of Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
  The estimated fair values and related carrying or notional amounts of the Company s financial instruments are presented in the following table.  Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are exempt from disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 
    
  Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company's financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique.  Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The estimated fair value amounts at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   have been measured as of each respective date, and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates.  As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each period-end.  The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets.  Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimate, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the recorded carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:

NOTE 9.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company has a stand-alone derivative financial instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement, which derives its value from underlying interest rates.  This transaction involves both credit and market risk.  The notional amount is an amount on which calculations, payments and the value of the derivative is based.  The notional amount does not represent direct credit exposures.  Direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid, if any.  Such difference, which represents the fair value of the derivative instrument, is reflected on the Company s balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities.  The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to this agreement.  The Company controls the credit risk of its financial contract through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures and does not expect any counterparty to fail its obligations. 
    
  Derivative instruments are generally either negotiated over-the-counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on a recognized exchange.  Negotiated over-the-counter derivative contracts are generally entered into between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms, including the underlying instrument, amount, exercise prices and maturity. 
    
  Derivative Instruments Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 
  Certain derivative instruments do not meet the requirements to be accounted for as hedging instruments.  These undesignated derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreement   - In 2012, management entered into an interest rate swap agreement that does not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of FASB's   "Derivatives and Hedging"   standard to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks.  At   September 30, 2016   and

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 

December 31, 2015  , information pertaining to the Company's interest rate swap agreement not designated as a hedge was as follows:  

The Company reported a gain in fair value on the interest rate swap not designated as a hedge in noninterest income of   $33,000   and   $48,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and a loss in fair value   of   $7,000   and   $22,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
    
  Derivative Loan Commitments   -     Mortgage loan commitments are referred to as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held for sale upon funding.  The Company enters into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future, with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market.  A mortgage loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock. 
    
  Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose the Company to the risk that the price of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitment might decline from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates.  If interest rates increase, the values of these loan commitments decrease.  Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increase.  
    
  Forward Loan Sale Commitments   -     To protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, the Company utilizes  mandatory delivery  forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the value of loans that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments. 
    
  With a  mandatory delivery  contract, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date.  If the Company fails to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, it is obligated to pay a  pair-off  fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall. 
    
  The Company expects that these forward loan sale commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of derivative loan commitments.

  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company considers accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies.  The Company considers the determination of allowance for loan losses, deferred income taxes and the impairment of long-lived assets to be its critical accounting policies.

  Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015    
    
  Assets: 
  Summary.    Assets increased   $56.2 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $1.54 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.48 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , principally due to increases of   $41.2 million   in net loans receivable and   $22.6 million     in cash and cash equivalents, offset by decreases of   $4.4 million   in available for sale securities and   $1.1 million   in  
  
   37 

loans held for sale.  Securities decreased primarily as a result of the sale of U.S. government and agency obligations.  Proceeds received from security sales were used to fund loan growth during 2016. 
    
  Loans Receivable, Net.    Net loans increased   $41.2 million   primarily due to increases of   $37.3 million  ,   $29.2 million   and   $14.5 million   in other commercial business loans, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and construction loans, respectively, offset by decreases of   $20.4 million  ,   $9.7 million   and   $9.2 million   in SBA and USDA guaranteed loans, timeshare loans and residential real estate loans, respectively.  Changes in the loan portfolio consisted of the following: 

Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate  .  Multi-family and commercial real estate loans represented   34.1%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   and   increased     $29.2 million  , or   7.6%  , during the first nine months of   2016  .  Loan originations for multi-family and commercial real estate loans were   $64.6 million  , representing an increase of   $6.5 million  , for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .   

Construction  .  Construction loans, which include both residential and commercial construction loans,   increased     $14.5 million   to   $36.3 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   as a result of increased commercial construction volume. 

Commercial Business.    Commercial business loans represented   24.7%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  .  Commercial business loans   increased     $9.2 million  , or   3.2%  , for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to an increase of   $37.3 million   in other commercial business loans, offset by decreases of    $20.4 million   in SBA and USDA guaranteed loans and   $9.7 million   in time share loans.  Commercial business loan originations increased   $7.2 million   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , unfunded lines of credit related to time share lending totaled $29.1 million as a result of focused efforts within the time share industry.    

Consumer  .  Consumer loans represented   4.6%   of the Company s total loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  .  Consumer loans   decreased     $1.2 million   during the first   nine months   of   2016   primarily as a result of a decrease of   $1.0 million     in indirect automobile loans.  Loan originations for consumer loans totaled   $19.3 million  ,   representing an increase of   $1.5 million  , for the first   nine months   of   2016   over the comparable period in   2015  . 
       
  The allowance for loan losses totaled   $11.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to   0.94%   at   September 30, 2016   from   0.84%   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in the commercial loan portfolio which carries a higher degree of risk (excluding guaranteed SBA and USDA loans) than other loans held in the portfolio. 

38 

The following table provides information with respect to nonperforming assets and TDRs as of the dates indicated. 

(1)    Includes nonperforming TDRs totaling $1.6 million and $991,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   (2)    Other real estate owned balances are shown net of related write-downs. 
    
  The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to decreases in nonperforming residential real estate loans of   $603,000   and nonperforming multi-family and commercial real estate loans of   $461,000  .  Nonperforming commercial business loans and home equity loans increased   $586,000   and   $190,000  , respectively, during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other real estate owned increased   $309,000   to   $1.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , due to the addition of five residential properties, offset by the sale of three residential properties and two commercial properties.  At   September 30, 2016  , other real estate owned included four residential properties and one commercial property. 
    
  Over the past few years, the Company has sought to restructure nonperforming loans rather than pursue foreclosure or liquidation, believing this approach achieves the best economic outcome for the Company in view of the current economic environment.  Modified payment terms for TDRs generally involve deferred principal payments, interest rate concessions, maturity extensions, or a combination of these items.  TDRs increased to $11.2 million at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $5.7 million at   December 31, 2015  .  Of the TDRs,   $9.6 million   and   $4.7 million   were performing in accordance with their restructured terms at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company anticipates these borrowers will repay all contractual principal and interest in accordance with the terms of their restructured loan agreements. 
    
  Liabilities: 
  Summary  .  Liabilities   increased     $50.7 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $1.38 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.33 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  Deposits   increased     $78.9 million  , or   7.5%  , which included increases in certificates of deposit of   $49.8 million  , noninterest-bearing deposits of   $15.1 million   and NOW and money market accounts of   $13.2 million  .  Deposit growth remained strong due to marketing and promotional initiatives and competitively- 
  
   39 

priced deposit products.  Borrowings decreased   $26.0 million   from   $242.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $216.8 million   at     September 30, 2016  , resulting from repayments of Federal Home Loan Bank advances with funds from excess deposits. 
    
  Equity: 
  Summary.    Shareholders  equity   increased     $5.5 million   from   $154.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $159.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily attributable to net income of   $4.8 million   and an increase in net unrealized gains on available for sale securities aggregating   $949,000   (net of taxes), partially offset by dividends declared of   $1.4 million  . 
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)  .  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities.  The net unrealized gains on available for sale securities, net of taxes, totaled   $759,000   at   September 30, 2016   compared to net unrealized losses of   $190,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  General.    The Company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on the Company s interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  The Company also generates noninterest income such as gains on the sale of securities, fees earned from mortgage banking activities, fees from deposits, trust and investment management services and other fees.  The Company s noninterest expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy, computer services, furniture and equipment, outside professional services, electronic banking fees, FDIC deposit insurance and regulatory assessments, marketing and other general and administrative expenses.  The Company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory agencies. 
    
  Summary.    The Company reported net income of   $1.6 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $974,000   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company reported net income of   $4.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .

The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to a higher average balance of total interest-earning assets versus the same period in 2015.  Interest income on loans and securities reflect net amortization of $162,000 and $179,000 for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to fair value adjustments of loans and securities resulting from the Newport acquisition.  The average yield earned on interest-earning assets for the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   six   basis points to   3.53%   compared to   3.59%   for the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The average balance of interest-earning assets increased   $88.3 million   to   $1.44 billion   during the third quarter of 2016, due to increases of   $42.3 million   in the average balance of other interest-earning assets,   $34.7 million   in the average balance of loans and   $11.3 million   in the average balance of securities, as compared to the same quarter in   2015  . 
    
  Total interest and dividend income increased   $2.5 million  , or   7.2%  , to   $38.0 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to the higher average balance of total interest-earning assets versus the same period in   2015  .  Interest income on loans and securities reflect net amortization of $184,000 and $543,000 for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to fair value adjustments of loans and securities resulting from the Newport acquisition.  The average yield earned on interest-earning assets for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   six   basis points to   3.58%   compared to   3.64%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The average balance of interest-earning assets increased   $119.5 million   to   $1.42 billion    
  
   40 

during the   nine months   of 2016, due to increases of   $75.0 million   in the average balance of loans,   $32.0 million   in the average balance of other interest-earning assets and   $12.5 million   in the average balance of securities, as compared to the same quarter in   2015  . 
    
  Interest Expense  .    For the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016  , interest expense increased   $208,000  , or   8.9%  , primarily resulting from a higher average rate paid and higher average balances of deposits compared to the same quarter in   2015  .  Higher interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities reflect net accretion of $119,000 and $184,000 for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to fair value adjustments of deposits and borrowings resulting from the Newport acquisition.  The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased   $65.8 million   to   $954.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and the average rate paid increased   eight   basis points to   0.71%  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to increases in the average balance of certificates of deposit.  Increases in the average balance of certificates of deposit and savings accounts totaled   $60.2 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively.  The average balance of FHLB advances decreased   $9.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the average rate paid decreased   three   basis points to   1.55%  .  The average rate paid on subordinated debt decreased   172   basis points to   2.32%  , compared to the same period in 2015, due to the maturity of a derivative financial instrument.  
    
  Interest expense increased   $1.0 million  , or   15.4%  , for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of the higher average balances of deposits and FHLB advances compared to the same period in   2015  .  Higher interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities reflect net accretion of $398,000 and $825,000 for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to fair value adjustments of deposits and borrowings resulting from the Newport acquisition.  The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased   $53.9 million   to   $939.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and the average rate paid increased   seven   basis points to   0.70%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Increases in the average balance of certificates of deposit and NOW and money market deposits totaled   $47.0 million   and   $9.1 million  , respectively, while the average balance of savings accounts decreased   $2.7 million   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The average balance of FHLB advances increased   $37.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , while the average rate paid decreased   six   basis points to   1.54%  .  The average rate paid on subordinated debt decreased   179   basis points to   2.28%  , compared to the same period in 2015 due to the maturity of a derivative financial instrument.

The following table sets forth the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have on the Company s interest income and interest expense for the periods presented.  The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume).  The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate).  The net column represents the sum of the rate and volume columns.  For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both changes in rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.    

(1)    Amount is net of deferred loan origination fees and costs.  Average balances include nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale. 
       (2)    Loan fees are included in interest income and are immaterial. 
       (3)    Municipal securities income and net interest income are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34%.  The tax equivalent adjustment is deducted from tax equivalent net interest income to agree to the amount reported in the statements of income. 
       (4)    Includes mortgagors  and investors  escrow accounts and brokered deposits. 

Provision for Loan Losses  .    The provision for loan losses decreased   $137,000   and increased   $61,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming loans decreased to   $6.3 million   compared to   $7.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  , resulting from decreases in nonperforming multi-family and commercial real estate loans of   $988,000   and nonperforming residential real estate loans of   $129,000  , offset by an increase in nonperforming commercial business loans of   $111,000  .  Net loan charge-offs were   $53,000   and   $165,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, consisting primarily of residential real estate and multi-family and commercial real estate loan charge-offs, compared to   $208,000   and   $263,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

Noninterest Income.    The following table shows the components of noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.  

Noninterest income decreased   $93,000   to   $2.7 million   and increased   $248,000   to   $7.9 million   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Decreases in other noninterest income of   $368,000   and   $136,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, was primarily a result of profit distributions from our investment in two small business investment companies during the same periods in 2015.  Service fees decreased   $114,000   and   $241,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to lower overdraft charges and interchange fees.  Mortgage banking activities increased   $364,000   and   $756,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015 as a result of increased volume of residential mortgage loan sales and gains on loans sold.  
    
  Noninterest Expenses  .    The following table shows the components of noninterest expenses and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Noninterest expenses decreased   $533,000   and   $1.2 million   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .  Marketing and advertising expenses decreased   $167,000   and   $236,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily as a  
  
   45 

result of a realignment of marketing initiatives with strategic goals of the Bank.  A reduction in occupancy and equipment expenses of   $146,000   and   $544,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, versus the comparable periods in   2015  , was in large part a result of strategic plans to reduce branch infrastructure costs, the reconfiguration and optimization of our telephone and data services and lower snow removal expenditures.  Costs related to other real estate operations decreased   $106,000   and   $265,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  During the   nine months   of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, salaries and employee benefits decreased by   $246,000   due to lower deferred compensation and equity award compensation expense, partially offset by an increase of   $143,000   in computer and electronic banking services due to data service speed improvements and electronic banking security enhancements related to the implementation of EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) technology.  
    
  Income Tax Provision  .    The provision for income taxes increased   $273,000   and   $956,000   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The effective tax rate for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was 33.0% and 33.7%, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was 33.0% and 32.9%, respectively.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short- and long-term nature.  The Bank's primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan sales and repayments, maturities and sales of securities and FHLB borrowings.  While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and loan and security sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
    
  The Bank's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents.  The levels of these assets depend on the Bank's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period.  At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $63.4 million  .  Securities classified as available for sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled   $170.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $57.0 million from the FHLB, which included overnight lines of credit of $10.0 million.  On that date, the Bank had FHLB advances outstanding of $208.6 million and no overnight advances outstanding.  Additionally, the Bank has the ability to access the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window on a collateralized basis and maintains a $7.0 million unsecured line of credit with a financial institution to access federal funds.  The Bank believes that its liquid assets combined with the available lines from the FHLB provide adequate liquidity to meet its current financial obligations. 
    
  The Bank's primary investing activities are the origination, purchase and sale of loans and the purchase and sale of securities.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank originated   $191.1 million   of loans and purchased   $29.5 million   of securities and   $33.7 million   of loans.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Bank originated $266.5 million of loans and purchased $45.4 million of securities and $113.2 million of loans. 
    
  Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and in borrowed funds.  The net increase in total deposits, including mortgagors  and investors  escrow accounts, was   $77.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  FHLB advances decreased   $26.0 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and increased $86.3 million during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in borrowings for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from the net repayments of FHLB advances with excess deposits.  Certificates of deposit due within one year of   September 30, 2016   totaled $208.5 million, or 18.3% of total deposits.  Management believes the amount of deposits in shorter-term certificates of deposit reflects customers  hesitancy to invest their funds in longer-term certificates of deposit due to the uncertain interest rate environment.  To compensate, the Bank has increased the duration of its borrowings with the FHLB.  The Bank will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit, if maturing certificates of deposit are not retained.  Depending on market conditions, the Bank may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than are currently paid on certificates of deposit.  Additionally, a shorter duration in the securities portfolio may be necessary to provide liquidity to compensate for any deposit  
  outflows.  The Bank believes, however, based on past experience, a significant portion of its certificates of deposit will be retained.  The Bank has the ability, if necessary, to adjust the interest rates offered to its customers in an effort to attract and retain deposits.   
    
  Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by the Bank and its local competitors and other factors.  The Bank generally manages the pricing of its deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposits and commercial banking relationships.  Occasionally, the Bank offers promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits.   
    
  The Company repurchased   7,877   shares of the Company's common stock at a cost of   $99,000   during the first   nine months   of   2016   and 628,530 shares of the Company s common stock at a cost of $7.5 million during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .    Additional discussion about the Company s liquidity and capital resources is contained in Item 7 in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  SI Financial Group, Inc. is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity.  In addition to its operating expenses, SI Financial Group is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders and making payments on its subordinated debentures.  SI Financial Group may repurchase shares of its common stock in the future.  SI Financial Group s primary sources of funds are interest and dividends on securities and dividends received from the Bank.  The amount of dividends the Bank may declare and pay to SI Financial Group in any calendar year, without prior regulatory approval, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years.  SI Financial Group believes that such restriction will not have an impact on SI Financial Group's ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  , SI Financial Group had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 million and available for sale securities of $5.1 million. 
    
  Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations 
    
  Information relating to payments due under contractual obligations is presented in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There were no material changes in the Company s payments due under contractual obligations between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit.  While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon.  The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer defaults and the value of any existing collateral becomes worthless.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 

46 

Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

Future loan commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included fixed-rate loan commitments of $7.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, at interest rates ranging from 2.63% to 5.85% and 2.88% to 5.75%, respectively. 
    
  The Bank is a limited partner in three small business investment corporations ("SBICs").  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s remaining off-balance sheet commitment for the capital investment in the SBICs was $813,000.  
    
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , with the exception of the aforementioned commitments, the Company did not engage in any additional off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    See Notes 6 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  Qualitative Aspects of Market Risk 
  The primary market risk affecting the financial condition and operating results of the Company is interest rate risk.  Interest rate risk is the exposure of current and future earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates.  The Company manages the interest rate sensitivity of its interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment.  To reduce the volatility of its earnings, the Company has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread.  The Company s strategy for managing interest rate risk generally is to emphasize the origination of adjustable-rate mortgage loans for retention in its loan portfolio.  However, the ability to originate adjustable-rate loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers  preferences.  As an alternative to adjustable-rate mortgage loans, the Company purchases variable-rate SBA and USDA loans in the secondary market that are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government.  These loans have a significantly shorter duration than fixed-rate mortgage loans.  Fixed-rate mortgage loans typically have an adverse effect on interest rate sensitivity compared to adjustable-rate loans.  Accordingly, the Company has sold more longer-term fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market in recent periods to manage interest rate risk.  The Company offers 10-year fixed-rate mortgage loans that it retains in its portfolio.  The Company may offer attractive rates for existing certificates of deposit accounts to extend their maturities.  The Company also uses shorter-term investment securities and longer-term borrowings from the FHLB to help manage interest rate risk. 
    
  The Company has an Asset/Liability Committee to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management.  The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. 

47 

In January 2012, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a third-party financial institution with a notional amount of $15.0 million, whereby the counterparty will pay a variable rate equal to three-month LIBOR and the Company will pay a fixed rate of 1.26%.  The agreement was effective on January 11, 2012 and terminates on January 11, 2017.  This agreement was not designated as a hedging instrument.   
    
  Quantitative Aspects of Market Risk 
  The Company analyzes its interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation.  The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are  interest rate sensitive.   An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period.  The Company s goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. 
    
  Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 
  The interest income simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions and are completed quarterly.  Interest income simulations and the numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are presented and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis.  Changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation.  The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates.  The simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors.  Simulation analysis is only an estimate of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time.  The Company continually reviews the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities. 
    
  The table below sets forth an approximation of the Company s exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next 12- and 24-month periods using interest income simulation.  The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments.  Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income simulation.  Because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage-backed securities the Company holds, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of the Company s earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position.  When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow.  When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise.  The Company s asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa.  While the Company believes such assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage-backed security and loan repayment activity. 
    
  The following table reflects changes in estimated net interest income for the Company at   September 30, 2016  . 

As indicated by the results of the above scenarios, net interest income would be adversely affected (within our internal guidelines) if rates decreased 100 basis points in the 12- and 24-month periods or increased 300 basis points in the 12-month period.  Conversely, net interest income would be positively impacted in the 12-month period if rates increased 200 basis points or in the 24-month period if rates increased 200 or 300 basis points as a result of the Company's initiative to position the balance sheet for the anticipated increase in market interest rates.  The Company s strategy for mitigating interest rate risk includes the purchase of adjustable-rate investment securities and SBA and USDA loans that will reprice in a rising rate environment, selling longer-term and lower  
  
   48 

fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, restructuring FHLB advances to current lower market interest rates while extending their duration and utilizing certain derivative instruments such as forward loan sale commitments to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
    
  The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ).  Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
    
  The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings believed by management to be material to the Company s financial condition or results of operations.  Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits against the Bank, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Bank holds a security interest, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other issues incident to the Bank s business.  Management believes these legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
    
  There are no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results.  The risks described in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks that the Company faces.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

49 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  The Company's repurchases of equity securities for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
  (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
