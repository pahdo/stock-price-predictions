EXXON MOBIL
CORPORATION    

NOTES TO CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.                      Basis of Financial Statement Preparation    

These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion
of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known
accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current
presentation basis.   

The Corporation's exploration and
production activities are accounted for under the  successful
efforts  method.     

2.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards    

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   .
The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure
requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018.
 Sales and other operating revenue  on the Consolidated Statement of Income
includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the
Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes
collected on behalf of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact
earnings.          The Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard
and its effect on the Corporation s financial statements.    

In February 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard,    Leases   . The
standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. The standard
is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019. ExxonMobil is evaluating
the standard and its effect on the Corporation s financial statements.   

Effective September
30, 2016, the Corporation early adopted Accounting Standard Update no. 2015-17    Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes    on a
prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred
tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead requires all
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. The balance
sheet classification of deferred income tax is shown below.       

8          

3.         Litigation and Other
Contingencies      

Litigation    

A variety of claims
have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries
in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures,  significant  includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.     

Other Contingencies    

The Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at
September 30, 2016, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and
other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect
management s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are
not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation s financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.     

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the Corporation s operations or financial condition. The Corporation's
outstanding unconditional purchase obligations at September 30, 2016, were
similar to those at the prior year-end period. Unconditional purchase
obligations as defined by accounting standards are those long-term commitments
that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that
third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will
provide the contracted goods or services.    

The
operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the
world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced
divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price
controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the
likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.     

In accordance with a
nationalization decree issued by Venezuela s president in February 2007, by May
1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed
the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership interest
in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project
into a  mixed enterprise  and an increase in PdVSA s or one of its affiliate s
ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if ExxonMobil
refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed enterprise within a
specified period of time, the government would  directly assume the activities 
carried out by the joint       

9          

venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.   

On September 6, 2007,
affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued
a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9,
2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of
the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and
a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce.    

On June 12, 2015, the
Tribunal rejected in its entirety Venezuela s October 23, 2014, application to
revise the ICSID award. The Tribunal also lifted the associated stay of
enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the application to revise.

Still pending is
Venezuela s February 2, 2015, application to ICSID seeking annulment of the
ICSID award. That application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the
Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award
was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. A separate stay
of the ICSID award was entered following the filing of the annulment
application. On July 7, 2015, the ICSID Committee considering the annulment
application heard arguments from the parties on whether to lift the stay of the
award associated with that application. On July 28, 2015, the Committee issued
an order that would lift the stay of enforcement unless, within 30 days,
Venezuela delivered a commitment to pay the award if the application to annul
is denied. On September 17, 2015, the Committee ruled that Venezuela had
complied with the requirement to submit a written commitment to pay the award
and so left the stay of enforcement in place. A hearing on Venezuela s
application for annulment was held March 8-9, 2016.   

The United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment on the
ICSID award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that
judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by reducing the rate
of interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of the court s judgment,
until the date of payment, were denied on February 13, 2015, and March 4, 2015,
respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of appeal of the
court s actions on the two motions. Oral arguments on this appeal were held
before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on January 7,
2016.   

The District Court s
judgment on the ICSID award is currently stayed until such time as ICSID s stay
of the award entered following Venezuela s filing of its application to annul
has been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation s
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the
Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the
Corporation s operations or financial condition.     

An
affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering
the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's
affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under
the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of
crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In
accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in
Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On
October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award
upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding
damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion
plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian
federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court
to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award.
The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial
Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the
lower court setting aside the award.     On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against
NNPC in the Nige  rian federal high court in order to
preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC
has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The stay in the proceedings in the Southern
District of New York has been lifted. At this time, the net impact of this
matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

4.             Other Comprehensive
Income Information      

(1) These accumulated other comprehensive income components are
included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. (See Note 6   Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional details.)

5.     Earnings Per
Share      

(1) The calculation of earnings per common share and earnings per
common share   assuming dilution are the same in each period shown.            

6.     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits      

12          

7.     Financial
Instruments    

The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $28,834 million at September 30, 2016, and
$18,854 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to recorded book
values of $27,687 million at September 30, 2016, and $18,687 million
at December 31, 2015. The increase in the estimated fair value and book
value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation s issuance of $12.0 billion of
long-term debt in the first quarter of 2016. The $12.0 billion of long term
debt is comprised of $750 million of floating-rate notes due in 2018, $250
million of floating-rate notes due in 2019, $1,000 million of 1.439% notes due
in 2018, $1,250 million of 1.708% notes due in 2019, $2,500 million of 2.222%
notes due in 2021, $1,250 million of 2.726% notes due in 2023, $2,500 million of
3.043% notes due in 2026 and $2,500 million of 4.114% notes due in 2046.   

The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at September 30, 2016, is: Level 1 $28,722 million;
Level 2 $106 million; and Level 3 $6 million. Level 1 represents
quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. Level 3 involves using internal data
augmented by relevant market indicators if available.     

8.     Disclosures
about Segments and Related Information      

13          

9.         Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs        

For the category of exploratory well costs
at year-end 2015 that were suspended more than one year, a total of $111
million was expensed in the first nine months of 2016.       

10.  Acquisition of InterOil Corporation    

On July 21, 2016, the Corporation
entered into an agreement to acquire InterOil Corporation (IOC) for more than
$2.5 billion. IOC is an exploration and production business with focus in Papua
New Guinea. Consideration includes $2.1 billion of Exxon Mobil Corporation
shares, a Contingent Resource Payment (CRP) and cash. The CRP provides IOC
shareholders approximately $7.07 per share in cash for each incremental
certified Trillion Cubic Feet Equivalent (TCFE) of resources above 6.2 up to
10.0. IOC s assets include a receivable related to the same resource base for
volumes in excess of 3.5 TCFE at amounts ranging from $0.24 - $0.40 per
thousand cubic feet equivalent. Closing is pending the outcome of an appeal by
an IOC shareholder of the Yukon Supreme Court decision approving the
transaction.

Item 2.       Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

References in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil
(U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and
Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.    

REVIEW
OF THIRD QUARTER 2016 RESULTS    

ExxonMobil s
third quarter 2016 earnings were $2.7 billion, or $0.63 per diluted share,
compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. Results reflect lower refining
margins and commodity prices.  

ExxonMobil s
integrated business continues to deliver solid results. While the operating
environment remains challenging, the company continues to focus on capturing
efficiencies, advancing strategic investments, and creating long-term
shareholder value.  

Earnings
in the first nine months of 2016 were $6.2 billion, down $7.2 billion, or 54
percent, from 2015.  

Earnings
per share assuming dilution were $1.47.  

Capital
and exploration expenditures were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from 2015.  

Oil-equivalent
production was essentially unchanged at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per
day, with liquids up 2.6 percent and natural gas down 4.4 percent.  

The
corporation distributed $9.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.  

15          

Upstream earnings
were $620 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $738 million from the
third quarter of 2015. Lower liquids and gas realizations decreased earnings by
$880 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million.
All other items, including lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign
exchange effects, increased earnings by $60 million.   

On an oil-equivalent basis,
production was down compared with the third quarter of 2015. Liquids production
totaled 2.2 million barrels per day, down 120,000 barrels per day. Higher
downtime, mainly in Nigeria, and field decline were partly offset by project
start-ups. Natural gas production was 9.6 billion cubic feet per day, up 77
million cubic feet per day from 2015 as project start-ups more than offset
field decline and divestment impacts.  

U.S. Upstream earnings declined
$35 million from the third quarter of 2015 to a loss of $477 million in the
third quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $1,097 million, down
$703 million from the prior year.  

Upstream earnings were $838
million, down $5,406 million from the first nine months of 2015. Lower
realizations decreased earnings by $5.8 billion. Favorable volume and mix
effects increased earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings
by $260 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of
asset management gains.  

On an oil-equivalent basis,
production of 4 million barrels per day was essentially flat compared to the
same period in 2015. Liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day
increased 59,000 barrels per day, with project start-ups partly offset by field
decline, the Canadian wildfires, and downtime mainly in Nigeria. Natural gas
production of 10 billion cubic feet per day decreased 458 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline
and divestment impacts were partly offset by project start-ups.  

U.S.
Upstream earnings declined $1,282 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,823 million
in 2016. Earnings outside the U.S. were $2,661 million, down $4,124 million
from the prior year.  

16          

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.   

Entitlements - Net
Interest      are changes to ExxonMobil s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of
net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.   

Entitlements - Price,
Spend and Other      are changes to ExxonMobil s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover
its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.   

Quotas      are changes in
ExxonMobil s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.   

Divestments      are reductions in
ExxonMobil s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration.    

Growth and Other      factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but
are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program
activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.   

17          

Downstream
earnings were $1,229 million, down $804 million from the third quarter of 2015.
Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by $1.6 billion while
favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $170 million. All other
items increased earnings by $580 million, including lower maintenance expenses
and gains from divestments in Canada. Petroleum product sales of 5.6 million
barrels per day were 203,000 barrels per day lower than the prior year mainly
due to divestment of the Torrance, California, and Chalmette, Louisiana,
refineries.   

Earnings
from the U.S. Downstream were $225 million, down $262 million from the third
quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $1,004 million were $542
million lower than prior year.   

Downstream
earnings of $2,960 million in the first nine months of the year decreased $2,246
million from 2015. Weaker refining margins decreased earnings by $3.3 billion,
while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $330 million. All other
items increased earnings by $680 million, mainly reflecting lower maintenance
expense and gains from divestments. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million
barrels per day were 306,000 barrels per day lower than 2015 mainly due to
divestment of the Torrance and Chalmette refineries.  

U.S.
Downstream earnings were $824 million, a decrease of $642 million from 2015.
Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $2,136 million, down $1,604 million from the
prior year.  

Chemical earnings of $1,171 million
were $56 million lower than the third quarter of 2015. Margins decreased
earnings by $10 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20
million. All other items decreased earnings by $70 million due primarily to
higher maintenance expenses. Third quarter prime product sales of 6.1 million
metric tons were 51,000 metric tons higher than the prior year's third quarter.  

U.S. Chemical earnings of $434
million were $92 million lower than the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S.
Chemical earnings of $737 million were $36 million higher than prior year.   

Chemical earnings of $3,743 million
in the first nine months of the year increased $288 million from 2015. Stronger
margins increased earnings by $440 million. Favorable volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $130 million. All other items decreased earnings by $280 million,
including the absence of asset management gains in the U.S. partly offset by
lower expenses. Prime product sales of 18.6 million metric tons were up
387,000 metric tons from 2015.   

U.S. Chemical earnings were $1,524
million, down $342 million from the first nine months of 2015 reflecting the
absence of asset management gains. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $2,219 million
were $630 million higher than prior year.   

18          

Corporate and financing expenses
were $370 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $378 million in
the third quarter of 2015.  

Corporate and financing expenses
were $1,381 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $1,535 million
in 2015.  

19          

Because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.    

Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2016 was $6.3 billion,
including asset sales of $1.0 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the comparable
2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.   

Cash provided by
operating activities totaled $14.7 billion for the first nine months of 2016,
$11.3 billion lower than 2015. The major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $6.4 billion, a decrease of $7.4 billion
from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $14.2
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.9 billion. Changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $2.4 billion in 2016 and
$1.0 billion in 2015. All other items net decreased cash flows by $3.5 billion
in 2016 and had no impact on cash in 2015. For additional details, see the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 6.    

Investing activities
for the first nine months of 2016 used net cash of $10.7 billion, a decrease of
$7.8 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $12.3 billion was $8.1 billion lower than 2015. Proceeds
from asset sales of $2.2 billion increased $0.6 billion. Additional investment
and advances were $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion.    

Cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 was $16.9 billion,
including asset sales of $2.2 billion, and decreased $10.7 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.   

During the first
quarter of 2016, the Corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. Net cash used by financing
activities was $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, $4.9 billion
lower than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of
purchases of shares of ExxonMobil stock in 2016.   

During the first nine
months of 2016, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. These purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company s benefit plans and
programs. Shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the third quarter 2016. Purchases may be made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.   

The Corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $9.3 billion in the first nine months of
2016 through dividends. This included $3.1 billion for the third quarter of
2016.   

Total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016 compared to
$4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015.   

20          

Total debt of $46.2
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. The Corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.7 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2016
compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.   

The Corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.   

The Corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
Corporation s common stock, or both.   

Litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.   

Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $12.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $1.9 billion from 2015. Income tax expense
decreased by $1.0 billion to $0.3 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. The
effective income tax rate was 20 percent compared to 32 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Sales  -based taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by
$0.9 billion to $12.5 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.  

Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $37.8 billion for the first
nine months of 2016, a decrease of $7.6 billion from 2015. Income tax expense
decreased by $4.6 billion to $1.0 billion reflecting lower earnings. The
effective income tax rate was 26 percent compared to 37 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.     Sales-based and all other taxes decreased by $3.0
billion to $36.8 billion   as a result of lower sales
realizations.  

In the United
States, the Corporation has various U.S. federal income tax positions at issue
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2006-2011. The IRS has
asserted penalties for all years associated with several of those
positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense
because, in the Corporation s judgment, the IRS should not be able to sustain the
penalties under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund suit for tax
years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court with respect to the positions
at issue for those years. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with
the IRS for 2006-2011 would not have a materially adverse effect on the
Corporation s net income or liquidity. The IRS has not completed its audit of
tax years after 2011.  

21          

Capital   and
  exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2016
were $4.2 billion, down 45 percent from the third quarter of 2015.   

Capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of
2016 were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from the first nine months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. Given continuing efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the Corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level between $20 and $21 billion.  

In 2014,
the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian
energy sector. ExxonMobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates  investments in the Russian Federation.    

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   .
The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning
January 1, 2018.  Sales and other operating revenue  on the Consolidated
Statement of Income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales
transactions. When the Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude
sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. This change in
reporting will not impact earnings. The Corporation continues to evaluate other
areas of the standard and its effect on the Corporation s financial
statements.    

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a new standard,    Leases   . The standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted
beginning January 1, 2019. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the Corporation s financial statements.         

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    

As disclosed in ExxonMobil s 2015 Form
10-K, low crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the Corporation s
reserves as reported under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.
Average year-to-date crude prices have been significantly affected by the very
low prices experienced during the first quarter of 2016, but have recovered
considerably since that time. If the average prices seen during the first nine
months of 2016 persist for the remainder of the year, under the SEC definition
of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil, such as those associated with
the Kearl oil sands operations in Canada, will not qualify as proved reserves
at year-end 2016. In addition, if these average prices persist, the projected
end-of-field-life for estimating reserves will accelerate for certain liquids
and natural gas operations in North America, resulting in a reduction of proved
reserves at year-end 2016. Quantities that could be required to be de-booked as
proved reserves on an SEC basis amount to approximately 3.6 billion barrels of
bitumen at Kearl, and about 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels in other North
America operations. Among the factors that would result in these reserves being
re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in
average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating
efficiencies. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government
royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to
ExxonMobil. We do not expect the de-booking of reported proved reserves under
SEC definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter
our outlook for future production volumes.   

22          

In light of
continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, and as
part of its annual planning and budgeting process which is currently in
progress, the Corporation will perform an assessment of its major long-lived
assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in late 2015, including North
America natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its
operations. The assessment will reflect crude and natural gas price outlooks
consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities
and generally consistent with the long-term price forecasts published by
third-party industry and government experts. Development of future undiscounted
cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment, particularly in
cases where an asset s life is expected to extend decades into the future. An
asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were
less than the asset s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The Corporation will
complete its asset recoverability assessment and analyze the conclusions of
that assessment in connection with the preparation and review of the
Corporation s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2016 Form 10-K.
Until these activities are complete, it is not practicable to reasonably
estimate the existence or range of potential future impairments related to the
Corporation s long-lived assets.   

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

Statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; asset
carrying values; reported reserves; resource recoveries; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome
of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government
regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading  Factors Affecting Future
Results  in the  Investors  section of our website and in Item 1A of
ExxonMobil's 2015 Form 10-K. Closing of pending acquisitions is also
subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided in the applicable
agreement. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.         

The term
 project  as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.   

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk    

Information about
market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, does not differ
materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2015.   

Item 4.  Controls and
Procedures    

As indicated in the
certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the
Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.
Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated
and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There were no
changes during the Corporation s last fiscal quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal
control over financial reporting.    

23          

PART II.  OTHER
INFORMATION    

Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings    

Regarding the
criminal charges filed against XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) by the Pennsylvania
Attorney General s Office pertaining to XTO s Marquardt Well Site in Penn
Township, Pennsylvania, reported most recently in the Corporation s Form 10-Q
for the first quarter of 2015, on August 3, 2016, the Lycoming County District
Court entered an order approving an Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD)
settlement of the case. Consistent with the settlement, XTO contributed
$100,000 to the Susquehanna Greenway Partnership for a project in the Lycoming
County area, agreed to comply with the existing Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) consent decree, and paid a civil penalty of $300,000 to the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection resolving all civil penalty claims. The
ARD term expires two years from the date of the court s order or upon
satisfaction of the EPA consent decree, whichever is sooner. Upon successful
completion of the ARD, all criminal charges will be dismissed and the record
will be expunged.   

Refer to the relevant
portions of Note 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further
information on legal proceedings.   

24          

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds    

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities    

On July 21, 2016, the
Corporation entered into an Arrangement Agreement to acquire all of the issued
and outstanding common stock of InterOil Corporation (IOC) in exchange for
consideration including shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock having a
value at the time of closing of $45 for each IOC share. The value of the
Corporation s common stock for this purpose will be determined based on the
Corporation s volume-weighted average trading price over a 10-day period ending
on the second trading date immediately preceding the closing date. As of
the date of this filing the transaction has not closed, but had the transaction
closed on September 30, 2016, the number of shares of common stock of the
Corporation issuable in connection with the transaction would have been approximately
24.7 million. With respect to the shares of common stock to be issued in
connection with the transaction, the Corporation is relying on the exemption
from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 in
light of the approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Supreme Court of Yukon,
Canada. See  Acquisition of InterOil Corporation  on page 14 for more
information regarding the transaction.

(See Note 1)  

During the third
quarter, the Corporation did not purchase any shares of its common stock for
the treasury.   

Note 1 - On August 1,
2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume purchases of shares of
its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares issued in conjunction
with company benefit plans and programs and to gradually reduce the number of
shares outstanding. The announcement did not specify an amount or expiration
date. The Corporation has continued to purchase shares since this announcement
and to report purchased volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its
earnings release dated February 2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will
continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with benefit plans
and programs, but had suspended making purchases to reduce shares outstanding
effective beginning the first quarter of 2016.
