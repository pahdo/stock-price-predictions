HNI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  October 1, 2016    

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  The   January 2, 2016   consolidated balance sheet included in this Form 10-Q was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement have been included.  Operating results for the   nine  -month period ended   October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in HNI Corporation's (the "Corporation") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  .  

Note 2.  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Corporation measures stock-based compensation expense at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes expense over the employees' requisite service periods.  For the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Corporation recognized   $1.0 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, of stock based compensation expense.  For the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation recognized   $1.7 million   and   $8.0 million  , respectively, of stock based compensation expense.  Stock-based compensation expense is the cost of stock options and time-based restricted stock units issued under the HNI Corporation 2007 Stock-Based Compensation Plan and shares issued under the HNI Corporation 2002 Members' Stock Purchase Plan.  The Corporation granted stock options with fair values of   $7.7 million   and   $6.5 million   and time-based restricted stock units with adjusted fair values of   $0.7 million   and   $1.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  At   October 1, 2016  , there was   $3.9 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, which the Corporation expects to recognize over a weighted-average remaining service period of   1.3   years, and   $1.1 million   of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested restricted stock units, which the Corporation expects to recognize over a weighted-average remaining service period of   1.0   years. 

Note 3.  Inventories 
    
  The Corporation values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with approximately   75 percent   valued by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") costing method. 

8 

Note 4.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Shareholders' Equity 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as applicable for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  : 

Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions in equity  . 

The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) and the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  : 

Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions in equity. 
    
  In March 2016, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge   $150 million   of outstanding variable rate revolver borrowings against future interest rate volatility.  Under the terms of the interest rate swap the Corporation pays a fixed rate of   1.29 percent   and receives one month LIBOR on a   $150 million   notional value expiring January 2021.  As of   October 1, 2016  , the fair value of the Corporation's interest rate swap was a liability of   $1.8 million  , reported net of tax as   $1.1 million   in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

9 

The following table details the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   (in thousands): 

Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions to profit. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Corporation repurchased   608,500   shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately   $30.4 million  .  As of   October 1, 2016  ,   $162.3 million   of the Corporation's Board of Directors' ("Board") current repurchase authorization remained unspent.  
    
  During the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation paid dividends to shareholders of   $0.275   and   $0.265   per share, respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation paid dividends to shareholders of   $0.815   and   $0.780   per share, respectively. 

Note 5.  Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS"): 

The weighted average common stock equivalents presented above do not include the effect of   352,380   and   536,814   common stock equivalents for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively, and   437,684   and   383,600   common stock equivalents for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 
  
    10 

Note 6.  Restructuring 
    
  Restructuring costs during the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   were   $1.1 million  , of which   $0.7 million   was recorded in "Cost of goods sold" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  Restructuring costs during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   were   $4.2 million  , of which   $2.2 million   was recorded in cost of goods sold.  These costs in both the quarter and year to date periods were primarily incurred as part of the previously announced closure of the Paris, Kentucky hearth manufacturing facility. 
    
  During the   three   months ended   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation recorded   $1.0 million   of restructuring costs, of which   $0.8 million   was recorded in cost of goods sold, due primarily to the decision to exit a line of business within our hearth product segment.  During the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation recorded   $0.8 million   of restructuring costs, all of which was recorded in cost of goods sold.  The costs resulting from the decision to exit a line of business within our hearth product segment were partially offset by lower than anticipated post employment costs related to previously announced closures of the Midwest Folding Products business located in Chicago, Illinois and an office furniture manufacturing facility in Florence, Alabama.  
    
  The following is a summary of changes in restructuring accruals during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  .   

The restructuring reserve is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and is included in "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Note 7.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The table below summarizes amortizable definite-lived intangible assets as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , which are reflected in the "Other Assets" line item in the Corporation's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

11 

Aggregate amortization expense for the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   was   $3.2 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively.  Aggregate amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   was   $8.6 million   and   $8.2 million  , respectively.  Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated amortization expense for each of the following five fiscal years is as follows: 

As events such as acquisitions, dispositions or impairments occur in the future, these amounts may change. 
    
  The Corporation also owns certain trademarks and trade names with a net carrying amount of   $41.0 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  .  These trademarks and trade names, which are reflected in the "Other Assets" line item in the Corporation's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are deemed to have indefinite useful lives because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill since   January 2, 2016   are as follows by reporting segment: 

The Corporation evaluates its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.  The Corporation estimates the fair value of its reporting units using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow method.  This method employs market participant based assumptions.  

Note 8.  Product Warranties 
    
  The Corporation issues certain warranty policies on its office furniture and hearth products that provide for repair or replacement of any covered product or component that fails during normal use because of a defect in design or workmanship.  Reserves have been established for the various costs associated with the Corporation's warranty programs. 
    
  A warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and an additional reserve for unknown claims that are expected to be incurred based on historical claims experience.  Actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserve.  Activity associated with warranty obligations was as follows during the periods noted: 

12 

The portion of the reserve for estimated settlements expected to be paid in the next twelve months was   $7.7 million   and   $8.2 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively, and is included in "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The portion of the reserve for settlements expected to be paid beyond one year was   $8.3 million   and   $8.0 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively, and is included in "Other Long-Term Liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Note 9.  Post-Retirement Health Care 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs included in the Corporation's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the periods noted: 

Note 10.  Income Taxes 
    
  The Corporation's tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items.  The Corporation's income tax provision for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   was   $16.8 million   on pre-tax income of   $50.6 million   or an effective tax rate of   33.2 percent  .  For the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation's income tax provision was   $18.6 million   on pre-tax income of   $59.5 million   or an effective tax rate of   31.3 percent  .  The effective tax rate was higher in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   principally due to bonus depreciation not being enacted as of   October 3, 2015  , which caused a higher expected U.S. manufacturing deduction and, indirectly, a lower effective tax rate for   October 3, 2015   as compared to the current quarter.  The provision for income taxes for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   reflects an effective tax rate of   34.1 percent   compared to   33.8 percent   for the same period last year.  The drivers of the change in effective tax rate for the first nine months were the same as those for the quarter. 

Note 11.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  For recognition purposes, on a recurring basis the Corporation is required to measure at fair value its marketable securities and derivative instruments.  The marketable securities are comprised of government securities, corporate bonds and money market funds.  When available the Corporation uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such measurements within Level 1.  Where market prices are not available, the Corporation makes use of observable market-based inputs (prices or quotes from published exchanges and indexes) to calculate fair value using the market approach, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. 
    
  Assets measured at fair value as of   October 1, 2016   were as follows: 

13 

Assets measured at fair value as of   January 2, 2016   were as follows: 

In addition to the methods and assumptions the Corporation uses to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed above in this section, it uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents - Level 1 
  The carrying amount approximated fair value and includes money market funds. 
    
  Long-term debt (including current portion) - Level 2 
  The carrying value of the Corporation's outstanding variable-rate debt obligations at   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , the end of the Corporation's   2015   fiscal year, was   $237 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, which approximated the fair value.  The Corporation paid off its outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations on April 6, 2016 with revolving credit facility borrowings.  The value of these senior notes was estimated based on a discounted cash flow method to be   $148 million   at   January 2, 2016  , compared to the carrying value of   $150 million  .  
    
  The Corporation, certain domestic subsidiaries of the Corporation, the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on January 6, 2016.  The Credit Agreement amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 9, 2015.   
    
  The Credit Agreement was amended to increase the revolving commitment of the lenders from   $250 million   to   $400 million   (while retaining the Corporation's option under the Credit Agreement to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional   $150 million  ) in order to provide funding for the payoff of its maturing senior notes on April 6, 2016 and to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from June 2020 to January 2021. The Corporation deferred the debt issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement, which were classified as assets, and is amortizing them over the term of the Credit Agreement.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there was   $237 million   outstanding under the   $400 million   revolving credit facility of which   $216 million   was classified as long-term since the Corporation does not expect to repay the borrowings within a year and the remaining   $21 million   was classified as current. 

Note 12.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Corporation utilizes letters of credit and surety bonds in the amount of   $14 million   to back certain insurance policies and payment obligations.  The Corporation utilizes trade letters of credit and banker's acceptances in the amount of   $5 million   to guarantee certain payments to overseas suppliers.  The letters of credit, bonds and banker's acceptances reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to competitively determined fees. 
    
  The Corporation has contingent liabilities which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business, including liabilities relating to pending litigation, environmental remediation, taxes and other claims.  It is the Corporation's opinion that liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition, cash flows or on the Corporation's quarterly or annual operating results when resolved in a future period. 

14 

Note 13.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-05,   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  . The ASU applies to cloud computing arrangements including software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service and other similar hosting arrangements and was issued to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The ASU provides guidance about whether the arrangement includes a software license. The core principle of the ASU is that if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance did not change U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for a customer s accounting for service contracts. The Corporation adopted the guidance effective January 3, 2016, the beginning of the Corporation's 2016 fiscal year. The guidance did not have a material impact on the Corporation's financial statements. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs in   April 2015, which was further clarified by ASU No. 2015-15 in August 2015.  The core principle of the ASUs is that an entity should present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the face amount of that debt in the balance sheet similar to the manner in which a debt discount or premium is presented, and not reflected as a deferred charge or deferred credit. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted and the effect of the change on the financial statement line item (that is, the debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability).  Debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can still be presented as assets and subsequently amortized.  The Corporation adopted the guidance effective January 3, 2016, the beginning of the Corporation's 2016 fiscal year. The guidance did not have an impact on the Corporation's financial statements because all debt currently held is a line-of-credit arrangement. 

Note 14.  Business Segment Information 
    
  Management views the Corporation as being in   two   reportable segments based on industries:  office furniture and hearth products, with the former being the principal business segment. 
    
  The aggregated office furniture segment manufactures and markets a broad line of office furniture which includes storage products, desks, credenzas, chairs, tables, bookcases, classroom solutions, freestanding office partitions and panel systems and other related products.  The hearth products segment manufactures and markets a broad line of manufactured gas, electric, wood and pellet fireplaces, inserts and stoves, facings and accessories. 
    
  For purposes of segment reporting, inter-company sales between segments are not material and operating profit is income before income taxes exclusive of certain unallocated corporate expenses.  These unallocated corporate expenses include the net cost of the Corporation's corporate operations, interest income and interest expense.  Management views interest income and expense as corporate financing costs and not as a reportable segment cost.  In addition, management applies an effective income tax rate to its consolidated income before income taxes so income taxes are not reported or viewed internally on a segment basis.  Identifiable assets by segment are those assets applicable to the respective industry segments.  Corporate assets consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and corporate office real estate and related equipment. 
    
  No geographic information for revenues from external customers or for long-lived assets is disclosed since the Corporation's primary market and capital investments are concentrated in the United States.

Reportable segment data reconciled to the Corporation's condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , is as follows: 

Note 15.  Business Combinations 
    
  On January 29, 2016, the Corporation acquired a small office furniture company with annual sales of approximately   $30 million   at a purchase price of approximately   $34 million  , net of cash acquired.  The Corporation will finalize the allocation of purchase price during the fourth quarter 2016 based on final purchase price and fair value adjustments.  Based on the preliminary allocation, there are approximately   $15 million   of intangible assets other than goodwill associated with this acquisition with estimated useful lives ranging from   three   to   ten   years with amortization recorded on a straight line basis based on the projected cash flow associated with the respective intangible assets.  There was approximately   $14 million   of goodwill associated with this acquisition. 
    
  As part of the Corporation's ongoing business strategy, it continues to acquire and divest small office furniture dealerships.  Goodwill increased approximately   $2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   as a result of this activity. 
  
    16 

Note 16.  Subsequent Events 
    
  On October 7, 2016 the Corporation approved the closure of its Orleans, Indiana office furniture manufacturing facility as part of its continued efficiency and simplification activities to deliver consistent, flawless execution to customers and to reduce structural costs.  The Corporation will consolidate the Orleans production into existing domestic office furniture manufacturing facilities and anticipates the closure and consolidation to be substantially completed by the end of 2017.  The Corporation estimates the consolidation will drive annual cash savings of   $6.9 million   beginning in 2018.  The Corporation estimates it will incur pre-tax charges of   $21.1 million   related to the closure and consolidations consisting of costs for workforce reductions, facility exit, manufacturing consolidation and production move costs.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
    
  The Corporation is a leading global provider and designer of office furniture and the leading manufacturer and marketer of hearth products. The Corporation has two reportable segments: office furniture and hearth products.  The Corporation utilizes a split and focused, decentralized business model to deliver value to customers through various brands and selling models.  
    
  Net sales for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2016   decreased   5.1 percent   to   $584.6 million   when compared to the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  .  The change was driven by a decrease in organic sales across both the office furniture and hearth products segments.  The office furniture segment sales were down due to lower project activity levels and subdued small business confidence driven by economic uncertainty.  The hearth segment saw a decline in the new construction business due to acquisition integration impacts partially offset by modest growth in single family housing.  The retail pellet business declined due to continued low oil prices and the impact of warm weather.  These decreases were partially offset by growth in retail wood/gas sales from modest remodel activity.  The acquisitions and divestitures of small office furniture companies resulted in a net increase in sales of $9.4 million compared to the prior year.  Gross profit percentage for the quarter increased from prior year levels driven by price realization, material cost and productivity partially offset by lower volume.  Total selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to lower volume and the impact of acquisitions partially offset by lower freight costs and expense timing.   
    
  The Corporation recorded $1.1 million of restructuring costs and $1.6 million of transition costs in the   third   quarter 2016 in connection with the previously announced closure of the Paris, Kentucky hearth manufacturing facility and structural realignments among office furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa.  Specific items incurred include severance, accelerated depreciation and production move costs.  Of these charges, $2.3 million were included in cost of sales.    The Corporation also recorded $1.6 million of accelerated depreciation in conjunction with the announced charitable donation of a building.  In the third quarter 2015, the Corporation recorded $1.0 million of restructuring costs, of which $0.8 million were included in cost of sales, and $1.3 million of transition costs, which were included in cost of sales, in connection with the decision to exit a line of business in the hearth segment and previously announced closures, acquisition integration and structural realignment.  

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table presents certain key highlights from the results of operations for the periods indicated: 

Consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased   5.1 percent   or   $31.2 million   compared to the same quarter last year.  The change was driven by a decrease in organic sales across both the office furniture and hearth products segments.  The office furniture segment sales were down due to lower project activity levels and subdued small business confidence driven by economic uncertainty.  The hearth segment saw a decline in the new construction business due to acquisition integration impacts partially offset by modest growth in single family housing.  The retail pellet business declined due to continued low oil prices and the  
  
    18 

impact of warm weather.  These declines were partially offset by growth in retail wood/gas sales from modest remodel activity.  The acquisitions and divestitures of small office furniture companies resulted in a net increase in sales of $9.4 million compared to the prior year.   
    
  Gross profit percentage for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased to   37.9 percent   compared to   37.6 percent   for the same quarter last year.  Gross margin for the quarter improved from prior year levels driven by price realization, material cost and productivity partially offset by lower volume.  
    
  Third quarter 2016 cost of sales included $0.7 million of restructuring costs and $1.6 million of transition costs related to the previously announced closure of the hearth manufacturing facility in Paris, Kentucky and structural realignments among office furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa.  Specific items incurred include accelerated depreciation and production move costs.  Third quarter 2015 cost of sales included $0.8 million of restructuring and $1.3 million of transition costs related to previously announced closures, acquisition integration and structural realignment. 
    
  Total selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to   29.0 percent   compared to   27.7 percent   for the same quarter last year driven by lower volume and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower freight costs and expense timing. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Corporation recorded $0.4 million in restructuring costs as part of selling and administrative costs due to the previously announced closure of the Paris, Kentucky hearth manufacturing facility.  The Corporation also recorded $1.6 million of accelerated depreciation in conjunction with the announced charitable donation of a building.  In the third quarter of 2015, the Corporation recorded $0.2 million of restructuring costs as part of selling and administrative costs primarily in connection with acquisition integration. 
    
  The Corporation's tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items.  The Corporation's income tax provision for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   was   $16.8 million   on pre-tax income of   $50.6 million   or an effective tax rate of   33.2 percent  .  For the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , the Corporation's income tax provision was   $18.6 million   on pre-tax income of   $59.5 million   or an effective tax rate of   31.3 percent  .  The effective tax rate was higher in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   principally due to bonus depreciation not being enacted as of   October 3, 2015  , which caused a higher expected U.S. manufacturing deduction and, indirectly, a lower effective tax rate for   October 3, 2015  .  The provision for income taxes for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   reflects an effective tax rate of   34.1 percent   compared to   33.8 percent   for the same period last year.  The drivers of the change in effective tax rate for the first   nine   months were the same as those for the quarter. 
    
  Net income attributable to the Corporation was   $33.8 million   or   $0.74   per diluted share in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $40.8 million   or   $0.90   per diluted share in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
    
  For the first   nine   months of 2016, consolidated net sales decreased   $85.3 million  , or   5.0 percent  , to   $1,622.2 million   from   $1,707.6 million  .  The change was driven by a decrease in organic sales across both the office furniture and hearth products segments.  The acquisitions and divestitures of small office furniture companies resulted in a net increase in sales of $20.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year.  Gross profit percentage increased to   38.0 percent   from   36.4 percent   from the same period last year.  The improvement was driven by strong operational performance, price realization, and favorable material cost and productivity partially offset by lower volume.   
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, the Corporation recorded as part of cost of sales $2.2 million of restructuring costs and $6.9 million of transition costs related to the previously announced closure of the hearth manufacturing facility in Paris, Kentucky and structural realignments among office furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa.  Specific items incurred include accelerated depreciation and production move costs.  For the first nine months of 2015, the Corporation recorded $0.8 million of restructuring costs and $3.8 million of transition costs in cost of sales related to the decision to exit a line of business in the hearth segment and previously announced closures, acquisition integration and structural realignment. 
    
  For the first   nine   months of 2016, total selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to   30.6 percent   compared to   29.7 percent   for the same period last year.  This increase was driven by lower volume, strategic investments and incentive based compensation partially offset by lower freight costs and expense timing. 
    
  The Corporation recorded   $2.1 million   of restructuring costs in the first nine months of 2016 as part of selling and administrative expenses due primarily to the previously announced closure of the hearth manufacturing facility in Paris, Kentucky.  The  Corporation also recorded a $2.0 million nonrecurring gain on a litigation settlement and $1.6 million of accelerated depreciation in conjunction with the announced charitable donation of a building.  In the same period last year, the Corporation incurred  
  
    19 

restructuring costs as part of selling and administrative expenses from previously announced closures, which were fully offset by lower than anticipated post-employment costs. 
    
  Net income attributable to HNI Corporation was   $74.7 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   $73.2 million   for the first   nine   months of 2015.  Earnings per share increased to   $1.64   per diluted share compared to   $1.61   per diluted share for the same period last year. 

Office Furniture 
    
  Third   quarter   2016   net sales for the office furniture segment decreased   4.4 percent   or $21.0 million to   $454.9 million   from   $476.0 million   for the same quarter last year.   Sales for the quarter decreased in our North America contract and international businesses partially offset by an increase in our supplies driven business.  The decrease was caused by lower project activity levels and subdued small business confidence driven by economic uncertainty.  The acquisitions and divestitures of small office furniture companies resulted in a net increase in sales of $9.4 million compared to the prior year quarter.    Third   quarter   2016   operating profit decreased   7.6 percent   or   $3.7 million   to   $44.7 million   from   $48.4   million in the prior year quarter as a result of lower volume partially offset by price realization, material costs and productivity and lower freight costs.   
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the office furniture segment recorded $0.1 million of restructuring costs and $1.2 million of transition costs as part of cost of sales primarily associated with structural realignments among office furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa.  In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the office furniture segment recorded $0.6 million of transition costs in cost of sales for previously announced closures and realignments.  Specific transition items incurred in both years include production move costs.  
    
  Net sales for the first   nine   months of 2016 decreased   $63.6 million  , or   4.8 percent  , to   $1,270.4 million   compared to   $1,334.0 million   for the same period in 2015 driven by a decrease in both supplies and contract channels.  The acquisitions and divestitures of small office furniture companies resulted in a net increase in sales of $20.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating profit for the first   nine   months of 2016 increased   $1.1 million  , or   1.0 percent  , to   $109.4 million   compared to   $108.3 million   for the same period in 2015 driven by strong operational performance, favorable material productivity, price realization and cost reductions.  These factors were partially offset by lower volume, strategic investments and higher incentive based compensation.   
    
  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the office furniture segment recorded $0.1 million of restructuring costs and $5.2 million of transition costs as part of cost of goods sold.  These charges were primarily associated with structural realignments among office furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa.  Specific transition costs incurred include production move costs.  In the same period last year, the office furniture segment recorded $2.5 million of transition costs in cost of sales related to production moves and structural realignments among furniture facilities in Muscatine, Iowa. 

Hearth Products 
    
  Third   quarter   2016   net sales for the hearth products segment decreased   7.3 percent   or   $10.2 million   to   $129.7 million   from   $139.9 million   for the same quarter last year.  The hearth segment saw a decline in the new construction business due to acquisition integration impacts partially offset by modest growth in single family housing.  The retail pellet business declined due to continued low oil prices and the impact of warm weather.  These declines were partially offset by growth in retail wood/gas sales from modest remodel activity.  Operating profit decreased   18.7 percent   or   $4.4 million   to   $19.1 million   compared to   $23.5 million   in the prior year quarter due to lower volume, inventory timing and expense timing partially offset by price realization and cost reductions. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of 2016, the hearth segment recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs and $0.4 million of transition costs as part of cost of sales.  These costs were incurred as part of the previously announced closure of the Paris, Kentucky, hearth manufacturing facility.  Specific items incurred include severance, accelerated depreciation and production move costs.  In the same period last year, the hearth segment recorded $0.8 million in restructuring costs and $0.7 million of transition costs in cost of sales related to the decision to exit a line of business and acquisition integration.  
    
  Net sales for the first   nine   months of 2016 decreased   $21.7 million  , or   5.8 percent  , to   $351.8 million   compared to   $373.5 million   for the same period in 2015.  Operating profit for the first   nine   months of 2016 decreased   $5.5 million   to   $41.6 million   compared to   $47.2 million   for the same period in 2015.  The year-to-date decreases in sales and operating profits were the result of the same drivers experienced in the current quarter.   
    
  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the hearth segment recorded $2.0 million of restructuring costs and $1.6 million of transition costs in cost of sales.  These costs were incurred as part of the previously announced closure of its manufacturing facility in Paris, Kentucky.  Specific items incurred include severance, accelerated depreciation and production move costs.   In the same period  
  
    20 

last year, the hearth segment recorded $0.8 million in restructuring costs and $1.2 million of transition costs in cost of sales related to acquisition integration and the decision to exit a line of business.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Flow   Operating Activities 
  Operating activities were a source of   $113.7 million   of cash in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to a source of   $58.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Working capital resulted in a   $26.6 million   use of cash in the first   nine   months of the current fiscal year compared to a   $74.9 million   use of cash in the same period of the prior year. The decreased use of cash compared to the prior year is primarily due to Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable as a result of timing of collections and payments and lower sales.  Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be positive for the year. 
        
  Cash Flow   Investing Activities 
  Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, for the first   nine   months of fiscal   2016   were   $82.5 million   compared to   $81.6 million   in the same period of fiscal   2015   and were primarily for building reconfiguration, tooling and equipment for new products, continuous improvements in manufacturing processes and the on-going implementation of an integrated information system to support business process transformation.  For the full year   2016  , capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 to $135 million. 
    
  Cash Flow   Financing Activities 
  The Corporation, certain domestic subsidiaries of the Corporation, the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on January 6, 2016.  The Credit Agreement amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 9, 2015.   
    
  The Credit Agreement was amended to increase the revolving commitment of the lenders from $250 million to $400 million (while retaining the Corporation's option under the Credit Agreement to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional $150 million) in order to provide funding for the payoff of its maturing senior notes on April 6, 2016 and to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from June 2020 to January 2021.  The Corporation deferred the debt issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement, which were classified as assets, and is amortizing them over the term of the Credit Agreement.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there was $237 million outstanding under the $400 million revolving credit facility of which $216 million was classified as long-term since the Corporation does not expect to repay the borrowings within a year and the remaining $21 million was classified as current. 
    
  The revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement is the primary source of committed funding from which the Corporation finances its planned capital expenditures and strategic initiatives, such as acquisitions, repurchases of common stock and certain working capital needs.  Non-compliance with the various financial covenant ratios in the Credit Agreement could prevent the Corporation from being able to access further borrowings under the revolving credit facility, require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding with respect to the revolving credit facility and/or increase the cost of borrowing. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of the following financial ratios as of the end of any fiscal quarter: 

a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.0 to 1.0, based upon the ratio of (a) consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the last four fiscal quarters to (b) the sum of consolidated interest charges; and 
                
    a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, based upon the ratio of (a) the quarter-end consolidated funded indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to (b) consolidated EBITDA for the last four fiscal quarters. 
       
  The most restrictive of the financial covenants is the consolidated leverage ratio requirement of 3.5 to 1.0.  Under the Credit Agreement, consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as non-cash, nonrecurring charges and all non-cash items increasing net income.  At   October 1, 2016  , the Corporation was below the maximum allowable ratio and was in compliance with all of the covenants and other restrictions in the Credit Agreement.  The Corporation expects to remain in compliance over the next twelve months. 
    
  In 2006, the Corporation refinanced $150 million of borrowings outstanding under its prior revolving credit facility with 5.54 percent, ten-year unsecured senior notes ("Senior Notes") due April 6, 2016 issued through the private placement debt  
  
    21 

market.  Interest payments were due semi-annually on April 6 and October 6 of each year.  The Corporation paid off the Senior Notes on April 6, 2016 with revolving credit facility borrowings. 
    
  In March 2016, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge $150 million of outstanding variable rate revolver borrowings against future interest rate volatility.  Under the terms of the interest rate swap the Corporation pays a fixed rate of 1.29 percent and receives one month LIBOR on a $150 million notional value expiring January 2021.  As of   October 1, 2016  , the fair value of the Corporation's interest rate swap was a liability of   $1.8 million   reported net of tax in the amount of   $1.1 million   in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  The Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share on the Corporation's common stock on August 9, 2016.  The dividend was paid on September 1, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 19, 2016. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Corporation repurchased   608,500   shares of common stock at a cost of   $30.4 million  , or an average price of $49.97 per share.  As of   October 1, 2016  ,   $162.3 million   of the Board's current repurchase authorization remained unspent. 
    
  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, coupled with cash flow from future operations, borrowing capacity under the existing Credit Agreement and the ability to access capital markets, are expected to be adequate to fund operations and satisfy cash flow needs for at least the next twelve months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Corporation does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Corporation's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  Contractual obligations associated with ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods.  A table summarizing the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments was provided in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  .  With the exception of the debt refinancing as described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the Corporation's contractual obligations or the estimated timing of the future cash payments for the first   nine   months of fiscal   2016  . 

Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Corporation is involved in various kinds of disputes and legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, including pending litigation, environmental remediation, taxes and other claims.  It is the Corporation's opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, that additional liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition, cash flows or on the Corporation's quarterly or annual operating results when resolved in a future period. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the financial statements requires the Corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Corporation continually evaluates its accounting policies and estimates.  The Corporation bases its estimates on historical experience and on a variety of other assumptions believed by management to be reasonable in order to make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  A summary of the more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements is provided in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  .

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  The new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The core principle of the ASU requires companies to reevaluate when revenue is recorded on a transaction based upon newly defined criteria, either at a point in time or over time as goods or services are delivered.  The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and estimates, and changes in those estimates.    The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations  , ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   to provide further clarification and guidance.  The new standard becomes effective for the Corporation in fiscal 2018 and allows for both retrospective and modified-retrospective methods of adoption. We are in the process of performing our gap assessment and implementation plan and expect to decide upon the the transition method by the end of 2016.  We are continuing to quantify the impact the standard will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on-balance sheet via a right of use asset and lease liability.  Changes to the lessee accounting model may change key balance sheet measures and ratios, potentially effecting analyst expectations and compliance with financial covenants.  The new standard becomes effective for the Corporation in fiscal 2019, but may be adopted at any time, and requires a modified retrospective transition.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the effect the standard will have on consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  .  The new standard eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when an increase in ownership interest in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The new standard becomes effective for the Corporation in fiscal 2017.  The Corporation anticipates the standard will have an immaterial effect on consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The new standard is intended to simplify accounting for share based employment awards to employees.  Changes include: all excess tax benefits/deficiencies should be recognized as income tax expense/benefit; entities can make elections on how to account for forfeitures; and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the cash flow statement.  While early adoption is allowed, the standard becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Corporation intends to implement the new standard in fiscal 2017.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The new standard provides classification guidance on eight cash flow issues including debt prepayment, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlements of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees.   The new standard becomes effective for the Corporation in fiscal 2018.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Looking Ahead 
    
  Management remains optimistic about the long term prospects in the office furniture and hearth products markets.  Management believes the Corporation continues to compete well and remains confident the investments made in the business will continue to generate strong returns for shareholders.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
