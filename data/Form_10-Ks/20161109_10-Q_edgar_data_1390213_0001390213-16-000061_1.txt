  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1. Organization 
    
  Corporate Property Associates 17   Global Incorporated, or CPA       :17   Global, and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, we, us, or our, is a publicly owned, non-listed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that invests primarily in commercial real estate properties leased to companies both domestically and internationally. We were formed in 2007 and are managed by W. P. Carey Inc., or WPC, through one of its subsidiaries, or collectively our Advisor. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation as long as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income and the level of our distributions, among other factors. We earn revenue primarily by leasing the properties we own to single corporate tenants, predominantly on a triple-net lease basis, which requires the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property. Revenue is subject to fluctuation due to the timing of new lease transactions, lease terminations, lease expirations, contractual rent adjustments, tenant defaults, sales of properties, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by CPA       :17 Limited Partnership, or the Operating Partnership, and at   September 30, 2016  , we owned   99.99%   of general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest in the Operating Partnership is held by a subsidiary of WPC. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was comprised of full or partial ownership interests in   388   fully-occupied properties, substantially all of which were triple-net leased to   116   tenants, and totaled approximately   42 million   square feet. In addition, our portfolio was comprised of full or partial ownership interests in   38   operating properties, including   37   self-storage properties and   one   hotel property, for an aggregate of approximately   3 million   square feet. As opportunities arise, we may also make other types of commercial real estate-related investments. 
    
  We operate in   two   reportable business segments: Net Lease and Self-Storage. Our Net Lease segment includes our domestic and foreign investments in net-leased properties, whether they are accounted for as operating leases or direct financing leases. Our Self-Storage segment is comprised of our investments in self-storage properties. In addition, we have investments in loans receivable, commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, one hotel, and other properties, which are included in our All Other category (   Note 14   ). 

Note 2. Basis of Presentation 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not necessarily include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented in this Report reflects all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the   2015   Annual Report, as certain disclosures that would substantially duplicate those contained in the audited consolidated financial statements have not been included in this Report. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Basis of Consolidation 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements reflect all of our accounts, including those of our controlled subsidiaries and our tenancy-in-common interest, as described below. The portions of equity in consolidated subsidiaries that are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us are presented as noncontrolling interests. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s, or FASB s, Accounting Standards Update, or   ASU, 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , as described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section below, which amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities. When we obtain an economic interest in an entity, we evaluate the entity to determine if it should be deemed a variable interest entity, or VIE, and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary and are therefore required to consolidate the entity. We apply accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs to certain entities in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Fixed price purchase and renewal options within a lease, as well as certain decision-making rights within a loan or joint-venture agreement, can cause us to consider an entity a VIE. Limited partnerships and other similar entities that operate as a partnership will be considered a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participation rights. Significant judgment is required to determine whether a VIE should be consolidated. We review the contractual arrangements provided for in the partnership agreement or other related contracts to determine whether the entity is considered a VIE, and to establish whether we have any variable interests in the VIE. We then compare our variable interests, if any, to those of the other variable interest holders to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the VIE based on whether the entity (i) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We performed this analysis on all of our subsidiary entities following the guidance in ASU 2015-02 to determine whether they qualify as VIEs and whether they should be consolidated or accounted for as equity investments in an unconsolidated venture. As part of this change in guidance, we determined that   15   entities that were previously classified as voting interest entities should now be classified as VIEs as of January 1, 2016 and therefore included in our VIE disclosures. However, there was no change in determining whether or not we consolidate these entities as a result of the new guidance. We elected to retrospectively adopt ASU 2015-02, which resulted in changes to our VIE disclosures within the consolidated balance sheets. There were no other changes to our consolidated balance sheets or results of operations for the periods presented. The liabilities of these VIEs are non-recourse to us and can only be satisfied from each VIE s respective assets. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we considered   29   entities VIEs,   14   of which we consolidated as we are considered the primary beneficiary and   two   of which we accounted for as loans receivable. The following table presents a summary of selected financial data of the consolidated VIEs, included in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands): 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         8 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we had   13   and   14   unconsolidated VIEs, respectively, all of which we account for under the equity method of accounting. We do not consolidate these entities because we are not the primary beneficiary and the nature of our involvement in the activities of these entities allows us to exercise significant influence but does not give us power over decisions that significantly affect the economic performance of these entities. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of our investments in these entities was   $396.6 million  , and   $432.6 million  , respectively, and our maximum exposure to loss in these entities was limited to our investments in the entities. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had an investment in a tenancy-in-common interest in various international properties. Consolidation of this investment is not required as such interest does not qualify as a VIE and does not meet the control requirement for consolidation. Accordingly, we account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. We use the equity method of accounting because the shared decision-making involved in a tenancy-in-common interest investment provides us with significant influence on the operating and financial decisions of this investment. 
    
  At times, the carrying value of our equity investments may fall below zero for certain investments. We intend to fund our share of the jointly-owned investments  future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have no legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. At   September 30, 2016  , none of our equity investments had carrying values below zero. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that our presentation of common shares repurchased should be classified as a reduction to Common stock, for the par amount of the common shares repurchase and as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital for the excess over the amount allocated to common stock, as well as included as shares unissued within the consolidated financial statements. We previously classified common shares repurchased as Treasury stock in our consolidated financial statements. We repurchased   1,826,959   shares from inception through December 31, 2011,   1,818,685   shares in 2012,   1,918,540   shares in 2013,   2,798,365   shares in 2014, and   3,089,139   shares in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. We evaluated the impact of this correction on previously-issued financial statements and concluded that they were not materially misstated. In order to conform previously-issued financial statements to the current period, we elected to revise previously-issued financial statements the next time such financial statements are filed. The correction eliminates Treasury stock of   $106.2 million   as of September 30, 2015 and results in corresponding reductions of Common stock and Additional paid-in capital, but has no impact on total equity within the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2015 and consolidated statements of equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The consolidated statement of equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 has been revised accordingly. The misclassification had no impact on the previously-reported consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted   ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest     (Subtopic 835-30)   as described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section below  .   ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs, which were previously recognized as an asset and requires that they be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. As a result of adopting this guidance, we reclassified   $12.8 million   of deferred financing costs, net from Other assets, net to Non-recourse debt, net and Senior Credit Facility, net as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued   ASU 2014-09  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 does not apply to our lease revenues, but will apply to reimbursed tenant costs and revenues generated from our operating properties. Additionally, this guidance modifies disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year, beginning in 2018, with early adoption permitted but not before 2017, the original public company effective date.     We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In February 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810).   ASU 2015-02 amends the current consolidation guidance, including modification of the guidance for evaluating whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for VIEs or voting interest model entities. The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model. Under the revised guidance, ASU 2015-02 requires an entity to classify a limited liability company or a limited partnership as a VIE unless the partnership provides partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the managing member or general partner. Please refer to the discussion in the Basis of Consolidation section above. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).   ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs, which were previously recognized as an asset and requires that they be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and retrospective application is required. We adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and have disclosed the reclassification of our debt issuance costs in the Reclassifications section above. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805).   ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, early adoption is permitted and prospective application is required for adjustments that are identified after the effective date of this update. We elected to early adopt ASU 2015-16 and implemented the standard prospectively beginning July 1, 2015. The adoption and implementation of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).   ASU 2016-02 outlines a new model for accounting by lessees, whereby their rights and obligations under substantially all leases, existing and new, would be capitalized and recorded on the balance sheet. For lessors, however, the accounting remains largely unchanged from the current model, with the distinction between operating and financing leases retained, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. The new standard also replaces existing sale-leaseback guidance with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. Additionally, the new standard requires extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for U.S. GAAP public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; for all other entities, the final lease standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application will be permitted for all entities. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition of the new guidance and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new model at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of the new standard and have not yet determined if it will have a material impact on our business or our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in counterparty to a derivative contract in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a hedging relationship. ASU 2016-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted and entities have the option of adopting this guidance on a prospective basis to new derivative contracts or on a modified retrospective basis. We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-05 on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-07, Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323).   ASU 2016-07 simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting. ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. Instead the equity method of accounting will be applied prospectively from the date significant influence is obtained. The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting in interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and we elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses.   ASU 2016-13 introduces a new model for estimating credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including loans receivable, held-to-maturity debt securities and net investments in direct financing leases, amongst other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for losses. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application of the guidance permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   ASU 2016-15 intends to reduce diversity in practice for certain cash flow classifications, including, but not limited to (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iii) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and (iv) distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application of the guidance permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  . ASU 2016-17 changes how a reporting entity that is a decision maker should consider indirect interests in a VIE held through an entity under common control. If a decision maker must evaluate whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it will only need to consider its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party. ASU 2016-17 amends ASU 2015-02, which we adopted on January 1, 2016, and which currently directs the decision maker to treat the common control party s interest in the VIE as if the decision maker held the interest itself. ASU 2016-17 will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.

The following tables present a summary of fees we paid, expenses we reimbursed, and distributions we made to our Advisor and other affiliates in accordance with the relevant agreements (in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a)  
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , non-cash investing activities were comprised of   $0.2 million   of current acquisition fees payable and   $0.4 million   of deferred acquisition fees payable. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , non-cash investing activities were comprised of   $1.5 million   of deferred acquisition fees payable. 
       
  The following table presents a summary of amounts included in Due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands): 

Acquisition and Disposition Fees 
    
  We pay our Advisor acquisition fees for structuring and negotiating investments and related mortgage financing on our behalf, a portion of which is payable upon acquisition of investments, with the remainder subordinated to the achievement of a preferred return, which is a non-compounded cumulative distribution of   5.0%   per annum (based initially on our invested capital). Acquisition fees payable to our Advisor with respect to our long-term, net-lease investments are   4.5%   of the total cost of those investments and are comprised of (i) a current portion of   2.5%  , typically paid upon acquisition, and (ii) a deferred portion of   2.0%  , typically paid over three years and subject to the   5.0%   preferred return described above. The preferred return was achieved as of each of the cumulative periods from inception through   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For certain types of non-long term net-lease investments, initial acquisition fees are between   1.0%   and   1.75%   of the equity invested plus the related acquisition fees, with no portion of the payment being deferred. Unpaid installments of deferred acquisition fees are included in Due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements. Unpaid installments of deferred acquisition fees bear interest at an annual rate of   5.0%  . 
    
  Our Advisor may be entitled to receive a disposition fee equal to the lesser of (i)   50.0%   of the competitive real estate commission (as defined in the advisory agreement) or (ii)   3.0%   of the contract sales price of the investment being sold; however, payment of such fees is subordinated to the   5.0%   preferred return. These fees are payable at the discretion of our board of directors.

Asset Management Fees and Available Cash Distribution 
    
  As described in the advisory agreement, we pay our Advisor asset management fees that vary based on the nature of the underlying investment. We pay   0.5%   per annum of average market value for long-term net leases and certain other types of real estate investments, and   1.5%   to   1.75%   per annum of average equity value for certain types of securities. Asset management fees are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock at our option, after consultation with our Advisor. If our Advisor receives all or a portion of its fees in shares, the number of shares issued is determined by dividing the dollar amount of fees by our most recently published estimated net asset value per share, or NAV, which was   $10.24   as of   December 31, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid our Advisor   50.0%   of its asset management fees in cash and   50.0%   in shares of our common stock. At   September 30, 2016  , our Advisor owned   11,510,492   shares, or   3.4%  , of our common stock. We also distribute to our Advisor, depending on the type of investments we own, up to   10.0%   of the available cash of the Operating Partnership, referred to as the Available Cash Distribution, which is defined as cash generated from operations, excluding capital proceeds, as reduced by operating expenses and debt service, excluding prepayments and balloon payments. Asset management fees and Available Cash Distributions are included in Property expenses and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Personnel and Overhead Reimbursements 
    
  Under the terms of the advisory agreement, our Advisor allocates a portion of its personnel and overhead expenses to us and the other non-listed REITs or other entities that are managed by our Advisor, including Corporate Property Associates 18   Global Incorporated, or CPA       :18   Global; Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated, or CWI 1; Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated, or CWI 2; Carey Credit Income Fund, or CCIF; and Carey European Student Housing Fund I, L.P., or CESH I; collectively referred to herein as the Managed Programs. Our Advisor allocates these expenses to us on the basis of our trailing four quarters of reported revenues in comparison to those of WPC and other entities managed by WPC and its affiliates.  
    
  We reimburse our Advisor for various expenses it incurs in the course of providing services to us. We reimburse certain third-party expenses paid by our Advisor on our behalf, including property-specific costs, professional fees, office expenses, and business development expenses. In addition, we reimburse our Advisor for the allocated costs of personnel and overhead in managing our day-to-day operations, including accounting services, stockholder services, corporate management, and property management and operations. We do not reimburse our Advisor for the cost of personnel if these personnel provide services for transactions for which our Advisor receives a transaction fee, such as for acquisitions and dispositions. Under the advisory agreement currently in place, the amount of applicable personnel costs allocated to us is capped at   2.4%   for 2015 and   2.2%   for 2016 of pro rata lease revenues for each year. Beginning in 2017, the cap decreases to   2.0%   of pro rata lease revenues for that year. Costs related to our Advisor s legal transactions group are based on a schedule of expenses relating to services performed for different types of transactions, such as financings, lease amendments, and dispositions, among other categories, and includes   0.25%   of the total investment cost of an acquisition. In general, personnel and overhead reimbursements are included in General and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements. However, we capitalize certain of the costs related to our Advisor s legal transactions group if the costs relate to a transaction that is not considered to be a business combination. 
    
  Excess Operating Expenses 
    
  Our Advisor is obligated to reimburse us for the amount by which our operating expenses exceeds the    2%  /  25%   guidelines  (the greater of   2%   of average invested assets or   25%   of net income) as defined in the advisory agreement for any 12-month period, subject to certain conditions. Our operating expenses have not exceeded the amount that would require our Advisor to reimburse us. 
    
  Loans from WPC 
    
  In March 2015, our board of directors and the board of directors of WPC approved unsecured loans from WPC to us of up to   $75.0 million  , in the aggregate, at a rate equal to the rate at which WPC was able to borrow funds under its line of credit, for the purpose of facilitating acquisitions approved by our Advisor s investment committee that we would not otherwise have had sufficient available funds to complete. All loans were made solely at the discretion of WPC s management. The WPC line of credit was terminated in August 2015 once we entered into the Senior Credit Facility (   Note 10   ).

The carrying value of our real estate increased   $25.2 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, particularly the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling, during the period. 
    
  Acquisitions of Real Estate During 2016 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired the following investments, which were deemed to be business combinations because we assumed the existing leases on the properties, at a total cost of   $51.2 million  , including land of   $6.7 million  , buildings of   $40.2 million  , and net lease intangibles of   $4.3 million   (   Note 7   ):

Acquisitions of Operating Real Estate During 2016 
    
  In 2013, we acquired a   45%   equity interest and   40%   indirect economic interest in Madison Storage NYC, LLC and Veritas Group IX-NYC, LLC, both of which are VIEs and were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in Equity investments in real estate in the consolidated financial statements. On April 11, 2016, we acquired the remaining   15%   controlling interest in these entities at a total cost of   $22.0 million   and, as a result, now have   100%   of the economic interest and consolidate this investment. In connection with this business combination, we expensed acquisition-related costs and fees of   $3.7 million  , which are included in Acquisition expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Due to the change in control resulting from the acquisition of this controlling interest, we accounted for this acquisition utilizing the purchase method of accounting. We recorded a non-cash gain on change in control of interest of   $49.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which was the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our previously held equity interest on April 11, 2016.

Credit Quality of Finance Receivables 
    
  We generally seek investments in facilities that we believe are critical to a tenant s business and that we believe have a low risk of tenant default. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of the balances of our finance receivables were past due and we had not established any allowances for credit losses. Additionally, there were no modifications of finance receivables during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   other than the extensions noted above. We evaluate the credit quality of our finance receivables utilizing an internal five-point credit rating scale, with one representing the highest credit quality and five representing the lowest. The credit quality evaluation of our finance receivables was last updated in the   third   quarter of   2016  .

Generally, the underlying investments are jointly-owned with affiliates. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investment s net assets at book value as if the investment were hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The fair value of an asset is defined as the exit price, which is the amount that would either be received when an asset is sold or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: Level 1, for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets, such as money market funds, equity securities, and U.S. Treasury securities; Level 2, for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the instrument, such as certain derivative instruments including interest rate caps, interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, and foreign currency collars; and Level 3, for securities and other derivative assets that do not fall into Level 1 or Level 2 and for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring us to develop our own assumptions. 
    
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  
    
  The methods and assumptions described below were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument. For significant Level 3 items, we have also provided the unobservable inputs along with their weighted-average ranges.  
    
  Derivative Assets     Our derivative assets, which are included in Other assets, net in the consolidated financial statements, are comprised of interest rate caps, foreign currency forward contracts, stock warrants, foreign currency collars and a swaption (   Note 9   ). The interest rates caps, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency collars, and swaption were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates, and were classified as Level 2 as these instruments are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not traded in an active market. The stock warrants were measured at fair value using internal valuation models that incorporated market inputs and our own assumptions about future cash flows. We classified these assets as Level 3 because they are not traded in an active market. 
    
  Derivative Liabilities     Our derivative liabilities, which are included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, are comprised of interest rate swaps and foreign currency collars (   Note 9   ). These derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates, and were classified as Level 2 because they are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not traded in an active market. 
    
  We did not have any transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 category of measurements during either the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Our other financial instruments had the following carrying values and fair values as of the dates shown (dollars in thousands): 

___________ 
            (b) 
    We determined the estimated fair value of these financial instruments using a discounted cash flow model that estimates the present value of the future loan payments by discounting such payments at current estimated market interest rates. The estimated market interest rates take into account interest rate risk and the value of the underlying collateral, which includes quality of the collateral, the credit quality of the tenant/obligor, and the time until maturity.

(c) 
    The carrying value of our CMBS is inclusive of impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as accretion related to the estimated cash flows expected to be received. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairment charges on our CMBS of   $1.0 million  . There were   no   purchases, sales, or impairment charges recognized during the three or   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
       
  We estimated that our other financial assets and liabilities (excluding net investments in direct financing leases) had fair values that approximated their carrying values at both   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . 
    
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis (Including Impairment Charges)  
    
  We periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate investments may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For investments in real estate held for use for which an impairment indicator is identified, we follow a two-step process to determine whether the investment is impaired and to determine the amount of the charge. First, we compare the carrying value of the property s asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows that we expect the property s asset group will generate, including any estimated proceeds from the eventual sale of the property s asset group. If this amount is less than the carrying value, the property s asset group is considered to be not recoverable. We then measure the impairment charge as the excess of the carrying value of the property s asset group over the estimated fair value of the property s asset group, which is primarily determined using market information such as recent comparable sales, broker quotes, or third-party appraisals. If relevant market information is not available or is not deemed appropriate, we perform a future net cash flow analysis, discounted for inherent risk associated with each investment. We determined that the significant inputs used to value these investments fall within Level 3 for fair value reporting. As a result of our assessments, we calculated impairment charges based on market conditions and assumptions. The valuation of real estate is subject to significant judgment and actual results may differ materially if market conditions or the underlying assumptions change.  
    
  The following table presents information about the asset for which we recorded an impairment charge that was measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis (in thousands): 

During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized an impairment charge of   $29.2 million   on one property in order to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value. The fair value measurements for the property approximated its estimated selling price, less estimated costs to sell. We used available information, including third-party broker information and internal discounted cash flow models (Level 3 inputs), in determining the fair value of this property.

Note 9. Risk Management and Use of Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Risk Management 
    
  In the normal course of our ongoing business operations, we encounter economic risk. There are four main components of economic risk that impact us: interest rate risk, credit risk, market risk, and foreign currency risk. We are primarily subject to interest rate risk on our interest-bearing assets and liabilities, including the Senior Credit Facility (   Note 10   ). Credit risk is the risk of default on our operations and our tenants  inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk includes changes in the value of our properties and related loans, as well as changes in the value of our other investments due to changes in interest rates or other market factors. We own investments in Europe and Asia and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  When we use derivative instruments, it is generally to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements. We have not entered into, and do not plan to enter into, financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In addition to entering into derivative instruments on our own behalf, we may also be a party to derivative instruments that are embedded in other contracts and we may be granted common stock warrants by lessees when structuring lease transactions, which are considered to be derivative instruments. The primary risks related to our use of derivative instruments include a counterparty to a hedging arrangement defaulting on its obligation and a downgrade in the credit quality of a counterparty to such an extent that our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction is impaired. While we seek to mitigate these risks by entering into hedging arrangements with large financial institutions that we deem to be creditworthy, it is possible that our hedging transactions, which are intended to limit losses, could adversely affect our earnings. Furthermore, if we terminate a hedging arrangement, we may be obligated to pay certain costs, such as transaction or breakage fees. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting, and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. 
    
  We measure derivative instruments at fair value and record them as assets or liabilities, depending on our rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. For a derivative designated, and that qualified, as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For a derivative designated, and that qualified, as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value and/or the net settlement of the derivative are reported in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of   Other comprehensive income (loss)   into earnings when the hedged investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of any derivative is immediately recognized in earnings.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding our derivative instruments (in thousands): 

All derivative transactions with an individual counterparty are governed by a master International Swap and Derivatives Association agreement, which can be considered as a master netting arrangement; however, we report all our derivative instruments on a gross basis on our consolidated financial statements. At both   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  ,   no   cash collateral had been posted or received for any of our derivative positions. 
    
  The following tables present the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated financial statements (in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    The effective portion of the change in fair value and the settlement of these contracts are reported in the foreign currency translation adjustment section of   Other comprehensive income (loss)   until the underlying investment is sold, at which time we reclassify the gain or loss to earnings.

Amounts reported in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   related to interest rate swaps will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest is incurred on our variable-rate debt. Amounts reported in   Other comprehensive income (loss)   related to foreign currency derivative contracts will be reclassified to Other income and (expenses) when the hedged foreign currency contracts are settled. At   September 30, 2016  , we estimated that an additional   $2.3 million   and   $6.9 million   will be reclassified as interest expense and as other expenses, respectively, during the next 12 months.

  See below for information regarding why we enter into our derivative instruments and concerning derivative instruments owned by unconsolidated investments, which are excluded from the tables above. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps, Caps and Swaptions 
    
  We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we attempt to obtain mortgage financing on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. However, from time to time, we or our investment partners have obtained, and may in the future obtain, variable-rate, non-recourse mortgage loans and, as a result, we have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements or swaptions with counterparties. Interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the variable-rate debt service obligations of a loan to a fixed rate, are agreements in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for a counterparty s stream of cash flow over a specific period. The notional, or face, amount on which the swaps are based is not exchanged. Interest rate caps limit the effective borrowing rate of variable rate debt obligations while allowing participants to share downward shifts in interest rates. A swaption gives us the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap, of which the terms and conditions are set on the trade date, on a specified date in the future. Our objective in using these derivatives is to limit our exposure to interest rate movements.

    Fair value amount is based on the exchange rate of the euro at   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Foreign Currency Contracts 
    
  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements, primarily in the euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and the Norwegian krone. We manage foreign currency exchange rate movements by generally placing our debt service obligation on an investment in the same currency as the tenant s rental obligation to us. This reduces our overall exposure to the net cash flow from that investment. However, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements to the extent that there is a difference in the timing and amount of the rental obligation and the debt service. Realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings related to foreign currency transactions are included in Other income and (expenses) in the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In order to hedge certain of our foreign currency cash flow exposures, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars. A foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to deliver a certain amount of currency at a certain price on a specific date in the future. A foreign currency collar consists of a written call option and a purchased put option to sell the foreign currency at a range of predetermined exchange rates. By entering into forward contracts and holding them to maturity, we are locked into a future currency exchange rate for the term of the contract. A foreign currency collar guarantees that the exchange rate of the currency will not fluctuate beyond the range of the options  strike prices. Our foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency collars have maturities of   78   months or less.

The following table presents the foreign currency derivative contracts we had outstanding and their designations at   September 30, 2016   (currency in thousands): 

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
    
  We measure our credit exposure on a counterparty basis as the net positive aggregate estimated fair value of our derivatives, net of any collateral received.   No   collateral was received as of   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , our total credit exposure was   $47.3 million   and the maximum exposure to any single counterparty was   $19.7 million  . 
    
  Some of the agreements with our derivative counterparties contain cross-default provisions that could trigger a declaration of default on our derivative obligations if we default, or are capable of being declared in default, on certain of our indebtedness. At   September 30, 2016  , we had not been declared in default on any of our derivative obligations. The estimated fair value of our derivatives that were in a net liability position was   $12.0 million   and   $11.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively, which included accrued interest and any nonperformance risk adjustments. If we had breached any of these provisions at   September 30, 2016   or December 31,   2015  , we could have been required to settle our obligations under these agreements at their aggregate termination value of   $13.1 million   and   $11.9 million  , respectively. 

Note 10. Debt 
    
  Non-Recourse Debt, net 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our mortgage notes payable bore interest at fixed annual rates ranging from   1.9%   to   10.9%   and variable contractual annual rates ranging from   1.3%   to   6.0%  , with maturity dates ranging from October   2016   to   2031  . 
    
  Financing Activity During 2016 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we obtained   five   new non-recourse mortgage financings and completed   two   additional drawdowns on already existing mortgage financings totaling   $122.2 million  , net of debt discounts of   $1.1 million  , with a weighted-average annual interest rate of   1.1%   and term of   6.0   years, of which   $12.0 million   related to an investment acquired during the current year and   $110.2 million   related to investments acquired during prior years.  
    
  Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of the remaining   15%   interest in a self-storage portfolio (   Note 4   ), we assumed the remaining   15%   of the outstanding mortgage debt totaling   $69.8 million  , net of debt discounts of   $1.2 million  , with a weighted-average annual interest rate of   4.5%   and term of   1.1   years. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we defeased   seven   non-recourse mortgage loans with outstanding principal balances totaling   $121.9 million   and recognized losses on extinguishment of debt totaling   $23.6 million  . These mortgage loans had a weighted-average interest rate of   4.9%   and a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of   5.7 years   and encumbered a total of   52   self-storage properties,   34   of which were sold (   Note 13   ) and   18   of which were refinanced with new non-recourse mortgage loans totaling   $65.9 million  , net of discounts of   $0.1 million  . These loans have a weighted-average interest rate of   3.02%   and weighted-average term to maturity of   4.8   years.

Additionally, during both the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we refinanced   one   non-recourse mortgage loan totaling   $11.2 million   with new non-recourse mortgage financing totaling   $16.7 million  , which has an annual interest rate of   1.9%   and term of   4.8   years. 
    
  Senior Credit Facility 
    
  On August 26, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and a syndicate of other lenders, which we refer to herein as the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement was amended on March 31, 2016 to clarify the Restricted Payments covenant (see below), no other terms were changed. The Credit Agreement provides for a   $200.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Revolver, and a   $50.0 million   delayed-draw term loan facility, or the Term Loan. We refer to the Revolver and the Term Loan together as the Senior Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $250.0 million   and, subject to lender approval, an accordion feature of   $250.0 million  . The Senior Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on   August 26, 2018  , and may be extended by us for two 12-month periods. 
    
  The Senior Credit Facility provides for an annual interest rate of either (i) the Eurocurrency Rate or (ii) the Base Rate, in each case plus the Applicable Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). With respect to the Revolver, the Applicable Rate on Eurocurrency loans and letters of credit ranges from   1.50%   to   2.25%   (based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR) and the Applicable Rate on Base Rate loans ranges from   0.50%   to   1.25%   (as defined in the Credit Agreement), depending on our leverage ratio. With respect to the Term Loan, the Applicable Rate on Eurocurrency loans and letters of credit ranges from   1.45%   to   2.20%   (based on LIBOR) and the Applicable Rate on Base Rate loans ranges from   0.45%   to   1.20%   (as defined in the Credit Agreement), depending on our leverage ratio. In addition, we pay a fee of either   0.15%   or   0.30%   on the unused portion of the Senior Credit Facility. If usage of the Senior Credit Facility is equal to or greater than   50%   of the Aggregate Commitments, the Unused Fee Rate will be   0.15%  , and if usage of the Senior Credit Facility is less than 50% of the Aggregate Commitments, the Unused Fee Rate will be   0.30%  . In connection with the transaction, we incurred costs of   $1.9 million  , which are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the Senior Credit Facility. 
    
  The following table presents a summary of our Senior Credit Facility (dollars in thousands): 

On September 30, 2016, we exercised the delayed draw option on our Term Loan and borrowed   $50.0 million  . The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR +   1.55%   and is scheduled to mature on   August 26, 2018  , unless extended pursuant to its terms. At   September 30, 2016  , availability under the Senior Credit Facility was   $200.0 million  . The Revolver and Term Loan are used for our working capital needs and for new investments, as well as for general corporate purposes. 
    
  We are required to ensure that the total Restricted Payments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) in an aggregate amount in any fiscal year does not exceed the greater of 95% of MFFO and the amount of Restricted Payments required in order for us to (i) maintain our REIT status and (ii) avoid the payment of federal or state income or excise tax. Restricted Payments include quarterly dividends and the total amount of shares repurchased by us, if any, in excess of   $100.0 million   per year. In addition to placing limitations on dividend distributions and share repurchases, the Credit Agreement also stipulates certain customary financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at   September 30, 2016  .

               (c) 
    In accordance with ASU 2015-03, we reclassified deferred financing costs from Other assets, net to Non-recourse debt, net and the Senior Credit Facility, net as of   December 31, 2015   (   Note 2   ). 
       
  Certain amounts in the table above are based on the applicable foreign currency exchange rate at   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of our Non-recourse debt, net increased by   $13.0 million   in the aggregate from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, particularly the euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling, during the same period. 

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were not involved in any material litigation. Various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business are pending against us. The results of these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our board of directors declared distributions in the aggregate amount of   $166.2 million  , which equates to $  0.4875   per share. 

Note 13. Property Dispositions 
    
  From time to time, we may decide to sell a property. We have an active capital recycling program, with a goal of extending the average lease term through reinvestment, improving portfolio credit quality through dispositions and acquisitions of assets, increasing the asset criticality factor in our portfolio, and/or executing strategic dispositions of assets. We may decide to dispose of a property due to vacancy, tenants electing not to renew their leases, tenant insolvency, or lease rejection in the bankruptcy process. In such cases, we assess whether we can obtain the highest value from the property by selling it, as opposed to re-leasing it. We may also sell a property when we receive an unsolicited offer or negotiate a price for an investment that is consistent with our strategy for that investment. When it is appropriate to do so, we classify the property as an asset held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.

  The results of operations for properties that have been sold or classified as held for sale are included in the consolidated financial statements and are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

2016     During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   22   self-storage properties for total proceeds of   $151.3 million  , net of closing costs, and recognized a gain on sale of   $82.3 million  . The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a non-recourse mortgage loan encumbering the properties with an outstanding principal balance of   $41.8 million  , and as a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $8.2 million  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   34   self-storage properties for total proceeds of   $259.1 million  , net of closing costs and recognized a gain on the sale of these assets of   $132.7 million   in the aggregate. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay non-recourse mortgage loans encumbering the properties with outstanding principal balances aggregating   $84.7 million  , and as a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $15.8 million  . 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we entered into an agreement with a tenant that occupies the majority of the square footage in a domestic office building to terminate their lease contingent upon selling the property to a third party. At   September 30, 2016  , the land and building related to this property were classified as held for sale as the sale is considered probable of closing, and an impairment of   $29.2 million   was recognized during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (   Note 4   ,    Note 8   ) related to the carrying value of the land and building. 
    
  2015     In connection with the partial sale of our investment in I Shops LLC in 2014, we deferred   15%   of the gain due to our then-existing purchase option to acquire a   15%   equity interest in the parent company that owns I Shops LLC. Upon expiration of the purchase option on January 31, 2015, we recognized the previously deferred gain of   $2.2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Business Overview 
    
  As described in more detail in Item 1 of the   2015   Annual Report, we are a publicly owned, non-listed REIT that invests primarily in commercial properties leased to companies both domestically and internationally. As opportunities arise, we also make other types of commercial real estate-related investments. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation as long as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income, the level of our distributions, and other factors. We earn revenue principally by leasing the properties we own to single corporate tenants, primarily on a triple-net lease basis, which requires the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property. Revenue is subject to fluctuation because of the timing of new lease transactions, lease terminations, lease expirations, contractual rent adjustments, tenant defaults, sales of properties, and foreign currency exchange rates. We were formed in 2007 and are managed by our Advisor. We hold substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership. We are the general partner of, and own   99.99%   of the interests in, the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest in the Operating Partnership is held by a subsidiary of WPC.

Dispositions 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   34   self-storage properties for aggregate proceeds of   $259.1 million  , net of closing costs, and recognized an aggregate gain on sale of real estate, net of tax, of   $132.7 million   (   Note 13   ). 
    
  Financing Activity 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we obtained   five   new non-recourse mortgage financings and completed   two   additional drawdowns on already existing mortgage financings totaling   $122.2 million  , net of debt discounts of   $1.1 million  . Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 15% controlling interest in a self-storage portfolio, we assumed the remaining 15% of the outstanding mortgage debt totaling   $69.8 million  , net of debt discounts of   $1.2 million   (   Note 10   ). 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we defeased   seven   non-recourse mortgage loans with outstanding principal balances totaling   $121.9 million   and recognized losses on extinguishment of debt totaling   $23.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . These mortgage loans encumbered a total of 52 self-storage properties,   34   of which were sold (   Note 13   ) and   18   of which were refinanced with new non-recourse mortgage loans totaling   $65.9 million  , net of discounts of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  On   September 30, 2016  , we exercised the delayed draw option on our Term Loan and borrowed   $50.0 million  . The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of   1.55%   and is scheduled to mature on   August 26, 2018  , unless extended pursuant to its terms. 
    
  Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we refinanced   one   non-recourse mortgage loan totaling   $11.2 million   with new non-recourse mortgage financing totaling   $16.7 million  .

Portfolio Overview 
    
  We intend to continue to acquire a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. We expect to make these investments both domestically and internationally. Portfolio information is provided on a consolidated basis to facilitate the review of our accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, we provide such information on a pro rata basis to better illustrate the economic impact of our various net-leased, jointly-owned investments.

Terms and Definitions 
    
  Pro Rata Metrics       The portfolio information above contains certain metrics prepared under the pro rata consolidation method.     We refer to these metrics as pro rata metrics. We have a number of investments, usually with our affiliates, in which our economic ownership is less than 100%. Under the full consolidation method, we report 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of those investments that are deemed to be under our control or for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, even if our ownership is less than 100%. Also, for all other jointly-owned investments, which we do not control, we report our net investment and our net income or loss from that investment. Under the pro rata consolidation method, we present our proportionate share, based on our economic ownership of these jointly-owned investments, of the portfolio metrics of those investments. 
    
  ABR         ABR represents contractual minimum annualized base rent for our net-leased properties and reflects exchange rates as of the date of this Report. If there is a rent abatement, we annualize the first monthly contractual base rent following the free rent period. ABR is not applicable to operating properties. 

Financial Highlights 
    
  (in thousands) 

__________ 
           (a) 
    We consider the performance metrics listed above, including Funds from operations, or FFO, Modified funds from operations, or MFFO, and Adjusted modified funds from operations, or Adjusted MFFO, which are supplemental measures that are not defined by GAAP, or non-GAAP measures, to be important measures in the evaluation of our results of operations and capital resources. We evaluate our results of operations with a primary focus on the ability to generate cash flow necessary to meet our objective of funding distributions to stockholders. See    Supplemental Financial Measures    below for our definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
       
  Total revenues increased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to increased lease revenues driven by new acquisitions and the acceleration of a below-market lease from a tenant of a domestic property pursuant to a lease termination agreement, partially offset in the nine month period by the bankruptcy settlement claim proceeds received during the second quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Net income attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased by   $38.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an aggregate gain on sale of real estate of   $82.3 million   recognized during the current year period, partially offset by an impairment charge of   $29.2 million   and an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of   $16.0 million   recognized during the current year period. Net income attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased by   $122.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an aggregate gain on sale of real estate of   $132.7 million   and a gain on change in control of interests of   $49.9  

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         42 

million   recognized during the current year period, partially offset by an impairment charge of   $29.2 million   and an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of   $23.6 million   recognized during the current year period. 
    
  FFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global decreased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the current year period. FFO increased for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the   $49.9 million   gain on change in control of interests, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the current year period. 
    
  MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   remained unchanged as compared to the same period in 2015.  Adjusted MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , due to additional rental income from assets acquired. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in other real estate income as a result of a disposition of 22 self-storage properties (   Note 13   ) and a reduction of interest income. 
    
  MFFO and Adjusted MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily as a result of the accretive impact of our investments acquired or placed into service during 2015 and 2016 and lower interest expense.  This increase was partially offset by a reduction in other real estate income as a result of a disposition of   34   self-storage properties and a reduction of interest income.

Results of Operations 
    
  We evaluate our results of operations with a primary focus on our ability to generate cash flow necessary to meet our objectives of funding distributions to stockholders and increasing the value of our real estate investments. As a result, our assessment of operating results gives less emphasis to the effect of unrealized gains and losses, which may cause fluctuations in net income for comparable periods but have no impact on cash flows, and to other non-cash charges, such as depreciation and impairment charges. 
    
  The following table presents the comparative results of operations (in thousands):

See    Supplemental Financial Measures    below for our definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
       
  Lease Composition and Leasing Activities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   51.5%   of our net leases, based on consolidated ABR, provide for adjustments based on formulas indexed to changes in the CPI, or similar indices for the jurisdiction in which the property is located, some of which have caps and/or floors. In addition,   44.7%   of our net leases on that same basis have fixed rent adjustments, for which consolidated ABR is scheduled to increase by an average of   1.2%   in the next 12 months. We own international investments and, therefore, lease revenues from these investments are subject to exchange rate fluctuations in various foreign currencies, primarily the euro. 
    
  The following discussion presents a summary of rents on existing properties arising from leases with new tenants and renewed leases with existing tenants for the periods presented and, therefore, does not include new acquisitions for our portfolio during the periods presented. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we signed   one   such lease totaling   1,658   square feet of leased space. This lease was an extension with an existing tenant. The average new rent for this lease remained   $18.00   per square foot. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we signed   seven   such leases totaling   210,121   square feet of leased space. Of these leases,   one   was with a new tenant and   six   were extensions with existing tenants. The average new rent for these leases is   $8.17   per square foot, compared to the average former rent of   $7.83   per square foot. We provided aggregate tenant improvement allowances totaling $  2.5 million   on two of these leases.

Property Level Contribution 
    
  The following table presents the property level contribution for our consolidated net-leased and operating properties as well as a reconciliation to   Net income attributable to CPA       :17   Global   (in thousands): 

__________ 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         46 

(a) 
    Includes recently acquired self-storage properties. 
              (b) 
    Includes the acceleration of lease intangibles pursuant to the lease termination. 
       
  Property level contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe to be a useful supplemental measure for management and investors in evaluating and analyzing the financial results of our net-leased and operating properties over time. Property level contribution presents the lease and operating property revenues, less property expenses and depreciation and amortization. We believe that Property level contribution allows for meaningful comparison between periods of the direct costs of owning and operating our net-leased assets and operating properties. When a property is leased on a net lease basis, reimbursable tenant costs are recorded as both income and property expense and, therefore, have no impact on the Property level contribution. While we believe that Property level contribution is a useful supplemental measure, it should not be considered as an alternative to Net income attributable to CPA       :17   Global as an indication of our operating performance. 
    
  Existing Net-Leased Properties 
    
  Existing net-leased properties are those we acquired or placed into service prior to   January 1, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   227   existing net-leased properties. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , property level contribution for existing net-leased properties increased by   $0.1 million  , due to an increase in lease revenues of   $0.4 million  , and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of   $0.4 million  , partially offset by an increase in property expenses of   $0.7 million  . Lease revenues increased primarily due to CPI-related rent increases of   $0.2 million   and revenues from a build-to-suit expansion on an existing property of   $0.2 million  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization occurred primarily as a result of   $0.6 million   lease extension executed in September 2015. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in 2015, property level contribution for existing net-leased properties increased by   $1.5 million  , due to an increase in lease revenues of   $1.4 million  , and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of   $2.0 million  , partially offset by an increase in property expense of   $1.9 million  . Lease revenues increased primarily due to CPI-related rent increases of   $1.1 million   and revenues from build-to-suit expansions of   $0.7 million  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization occurred primarily as a result of   $1.9 million   lease extension executed in September 2015. Property expenses increased by $0.6 million primarily due to tenant vacancies in an office building. 
    
  Recently Acquired Net-Leased Properties 
    
  Recently acquired net-leased properties are those that we acquired or placed into service subsequent to   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , property level contribution from recently acquired net-leased properties increased by   $1.5 million   and   $11.7 million  , respectively, primarily due to an increase in lease revenues of   $2.8 million   and   $17.6 million  , respectively, as a result of the   26   properties acquired or placed into service during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of   $1.3 million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively. Additionally, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   property expense decreased by   $1.0 million   due to the receipt of past due receivables which were previously reserved for. 
    
  Operating Properties 
    
  Other real estate operations represent primarily the results of operations, or revenues and operating expenses, of our   37   wholly-owned self-storage properties. Our self-storage properties include both existing and recently acquired investments. Additionally, other real estate operations includes the results of operations of a parking garage attached to one of our existing net-leased properties. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , property level contribution from operating properties remained substantially flat. On April 11, 2016, we acquired the remaining 15% controlling interest in five self-storage properties, that were previously accounted for as equity investments in real estate. As a result, we consolidated this investment and reflect 100% of the property level contribution from these assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (   Note 4   ). For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the revenues, property expenses and depreciation and amortization from these properties were   $2.6 million  ,   $0.7 million  , and   $2.3 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the revenues, property expenses and depreciation and amortization from these properties were   $5.2 million  ,   $1.5 million  , and   $4.3 million  , respectively. The remaining increases in revenues from operating properties for both the  

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         47 

three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in 2015 were primarily due to an increase in occupancy rate for our self-storage properties from   90.2%   at   September 30, 2015   to   92.3%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Properties Sold or Held for Sale 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   22   and   34   self-storage properties, respectively, and had one property classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016 (   Note 13   ). For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , property level contribution from properties sold or held for sale was   $1.8 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , property level contribution from properties sold or held for sale was   $5.8 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively. The three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   include the acceleration of amortization of an in-place lease intangible asset and below-market rent intangible liability of $3.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as a result of a lease termination with a tenant in a domestic office building. 

Other Revenues and Expenses 
    
  Interest Income and Other 
    
  Interest income and other primarily consists of interest earned on our loans receivable and CMBS investments. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , interest income and other decreased by   $2.4 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, primarily due to decreases in interest income of   $1.1 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, as a result of a loan receivable repayment in December 2015 (   Note 5   ), and decreases in accretion of   $0.8 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, related to another loan that was fully accreted during the current year periods. Additionally, we received proceeds of   $6.3 million   during the second quarter of 2015 relating to a bankruptcy settlement claim with a former tenant. 
    
  Impairment Charges 
    
  Where the undiscounted cash flows for an asset are less than the asset s carrying value when considering and evaluating the various alternative courses of action that may occur, we recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. Further, when we classify an asset as held for sale, we carry the asset at the lower of its current carrying value or its fair value, less estimated cost to sell. Our impairment charges are more fully described in    Note 8   . 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred other-than-temporary impairment charges of   $29.2 million   on one property classified as Assets held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   in order to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value. The fair value measurement approximated its estimated selling price. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we did not recognize any impairment charges. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred other-than-temporary impairment charges of   $1.0 million   on two of our CMBS tranches to reduce their carrying values to their estimated fair values as a result of non-performance. 
    
  Property Expenses   Asset Management Fees 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , asset management fees increased by   $0.1 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, due primarily to the growth in our investment volume during 2015 and 2016, and an increase in the estimated fair value of our real estate, both of which increased the asset base from which our Advisor earns a fee. 
    
  General and Administrative 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , general and administrative expenses decreased by   $1.0 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in reimbursable overhead and compensation of   $1.0 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively, as a result of a decline in the percentage and total costs allocable to us from our Advisor (   Note 3   ), slightly offset by an increase in investor relations expenses of   $0.1 million  , and   $0.8 million  , respectively.

Acquisition Expenses 
    
  Acquisition expenses represent direct costs incurred to acquire properties in transactions that are accounted for as business combinations, whereby such costs are required to be expensed as incurred (   Note 4   ). For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred acquisition expenses of   $1.4 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively, related to properties acquired that were deemed to be business combinations. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , interest expense increased by   $0.9 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively, primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding debt in connection with our investing activity during 2015 and 2016, offset by an overall decrease in our weighted-average interest rate. Our average outstanding debt balance was   $2.1 billion   and   $1.9 billion   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $2.0 billion   and   $1.9 billion   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our weighted-average interest rate was   4.4%   and   4.7%   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   4.5%   and   4.8%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $16.0 million   and   $23.6 million   respectively, as a result of the disposition and refinancing of properties in 2016 (   Note 10   ).

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investments in Real Estate 
    
  Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investments in real estate is recognized in accordance with the investment agreement for each of our equity method investments and, where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investment s net assets at book value as if the investment were hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. Further details about our equity method investments are discussed in    Note 6   . The following table presents the details of our Equity in earnings of equity method investments in real estate (in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    The decrease in income primarily relates to the recognition of tax benefits as an outcome of the tax audits for the prior years. The lower tax assessments for 2013 led to a tax benefit adjustment during the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
              (b) 
    In April 2016, we purchased the remaining   15%   controlling interest in this equity investment and therefore consolidated this investment since the date of purchase (   Note 4   ). 
              (c) 
    This build-to-suit investment was placed into service in May 2015. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   we recognized equity investment income as a result of the contribution of capital from other partners. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , this investment operated at the loss. 
              (d) 
    During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the change was driven primarily by an increase in operating income related to increased profitability and margins. Additionally, during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , this equity investment recognized a gain on sale related to two dispositions. 
              (e) 
    Variances between the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the comparable periods in   2015   were primarily due to timing of capital contributions from our partners to partially fund cumulative losses that had previously been recognized on our investment as a result of applying the hypothetical liquidation book value model. 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         50 

Other Income and (Expenses) 
    
  Other income and (expenses) primarily consists of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and derivative instruments. We make intercompany loans to a number of our foreign subsidiaries, most of which do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Remeasurement of foreign currency intercompany transactions that are scheduled for settlement, consisting primarily of accrued interest and short term loans, are included in the determination of net income. We also recognize gains or losses on foreign currency transactions when we repatriate cash from our foreign investments or hold foreign currencies in entities with a U.S. dollar currency designation. In addition, we have certain derivative instruments, including common stock warrants, foreign currency contracts and a swaption, that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, for which realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. The timing and amount of such gains or losses cannot always be estimated and are subject to fluctuation. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized net other income of   $2.7 million  , which was primarily comprised of   $2.3 million   of gains recognized on derivatives and   $0.2 million   of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains related to our international investments. 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized net other income of   $2.1 million  , which was primarily comprised of $2.0 million in gains recognized on derivatives, $0.4 million realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains related to our international investments, and $0.3 million interest income received on our cash balances held with financial institutions, partially offset by $0.6 million of other losses related to the write-off of a purchase option which expired in July 2015. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized net other income of   $7.1 million  , which was primarily comprised of   $5.7 million   of gains recognized on derivatives and   $1.2 million   of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains related to our international investments. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized net other income of   $3.2 million  , which was primarily comprised of gains recognized on derivatives of $6.8 million and interest income received on our cash balances held with financial institutions of $1.0 million, partially offset by realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to our international investments of $4.0 million, other losses of $0.6 million related to the write-off of a purchase option that expired in July 2015, and a loss recognized on the extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million related to the prepayment of a non-recourse mortgage loan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Gain on Change in Control of Interests 
    
  In connection with our acquisition of the remaining 15% controlling interest in a jointly-owned investment in five self-storage properties that was previously accounted for as an equity method investment, we recorded a $49.9 million gain on change in control of interests during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (   Note 4   ). As a result of this acquisition, we consolidate this investment as of   September 30, 2016  . The gain on change in control represents the difference between our carrying values and the fair values of our previously held equity interests in these properties. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , provision for income taxes increased by   $0.7 million   primarily related to a deferred tax provision associated with a basis difference on a TRS which holds an equity interest in a subsidiary. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , provision for income taxes increased by 
  $2.1 million  , primarily related to an increase in deferred tax provisions of   $3.5 million   associated with basis differences on certain domestic and foreign properties.  This is partially offset by a decrease in current federal, foreign and state franchise tax benefits of   $1.4 million  , which is primarily the result of current tax expense of   $0.9 million   recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   relating to proceeds received from a bankruptcy settlement claim with a former tenant. 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         51 

Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized gains on sales of real estate of   $82.3 million   and   $132.7 million  , respectively, as a result of the sales of   22   and   34   self-storage properties, respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized a deferred gain on sale of real estate, net of tax, of   $2.2 million   as a result of the partial sale related to I Shops LLC, which occurred in 2014 (   Note 13   ).  
    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the decrease primarily related to the decrease in the Available Cash Distribution paid to our Advisor (   Note 3   ). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the income generated from certain of our joint-venture investments, partially offset by $2.1 million of our affiliate s share of proceeds from a bankruptcy settlement claim with a former tenant received during the second quarter of 2015 and an increase in the Available Cash Distribution paid to our Advisor as a result of our investment activity since   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Modified Funds from Operations 
    
  MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are non-GAAP measures that we use to evaluate our business. For definitions of MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, and respective reconciliations to Net income attributable to CPA       :17   Global, see    Supplemental Financial Measures    below. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global remained unchanged. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , Adjusted MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased by   $1.5 million  , primarily due to the accretive impact of our investments acquired partially offset by a decrease related to our dispositions, and a reduction of interest income. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased by   $4.3 million  , primarily due to the accretive impact of our investments acquired and lower interest expense partially offset by a decrease related to our dispositions, a reduction of interest income and an increase of deferred tax expense. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , Adjusted MFFO attributable to CPA       :17   Global increased by   $6.1 million  , primarily due to the accretive impact of our investments acquired and lower interest expense partially offset by a decrease related to our dispositions, and a reduction of interest income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, service debt, and fund distributions to stockholders. We currently expect that, for the short term, the cash requirements discussed below will be funded by our cash on hand, financings, or unused capacity under our Senior Credit Facility. We may also use proceeds from financings and asset sales for the acquisition of real estate and real estate related investments. 
    
  Our liquidity would be affected adversely by unanticipated costs and greater-than-anticipated operating expenses. To the extent that our working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowings. In addition, we may incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of real estate, refinance the debt thereon, arrange for the leveraging of any previously unfinanced property, or reinvest the proceeds of financings or refinancings in additional properties. 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         52 

Sources and Uses of Cash During the Period 
    
  We expect to continue to invest in a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial properties and other real estate-related assets. We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, service debt, and fund distributions to our stockholders. Our cash flows will fluctuate periodically due to a number of factors, which may include, among other things, the timing of purchases and sales of real estate; the timing of the receipt of the proceeds from, and the repayment of, non-recourse mortgage loans and the receipt of lease revenues; whether our Advisor receives fees in shares of our common stock or cash, or a combination of both (as elected by our board of directors after consultation with our Advisor); the timing and characterization of distributions received from equity investments in real estate; the timing of payments of the Available Cash Distribution to our Advisor; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Despite these fluctuations, we believe our net leases and other real estate-related assets will generate sufficient cash from operations and from equity distributions in excess of equity income in real estate to meet our normal recurring short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We may also use existing cash resources, the proceeds of non-recourse mortgage loans, unused capacity under our Senior Credit Facility, and the issuance of additional equity securities to meet these needs. We assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis. Our sources and uses of cash during the period are described below. 
    
  Operating Activities         Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $  33.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the increase in defeasance fees and costs paid in connection with debt repayments of   $22.3 million  ,   $6.1 million   of acquisition expenses related to our business combinations in 2016, and   $3.5 million   related to timing differences in rent receivable and prepaid rents, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow generated from investments acquired after   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, during the second quarter of 2015 we received proceeds of $6.3 million from a bankruptcy settlement claim with a former tenant. 
    
  Investing Activities         Our investing activities are generally comprised of real estate-related transactions, payment of deferred acquisition fees to our Advisor related to asset acquisitions, and capitalized property-related costs. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   34   self-storage properties for net proceeds of   $258.3 million  , net of selling costs. We funded   $79.5 million   for real estate investment acquisitions and   $9.6 million   in capital expenditures for owned real estate (   Note 4   ,    Note 5   ). We had net cash outflows of   $42.9 million   related to a change in restricted cash and received   $30.0 million   as a return of capital from our equity method investments in real estate. We recovered   $23.8 million   of value-added taxes in connection with our international acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Financing Activities     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our gross borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility were   $225.7 million  , including a $50.0 million delayed draw of our Term Loan, and repayments were   $289.6 million  . We received   $204.0 million   in proceeds from non-recourse mortgage financings related to new and existing investments (   Note 10   ). We paid distributions to our stockholders related to the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016 totaling   $165.3 million  , which were comprised of cash distributions of   $87.6 million   and distributions that were reinvested in shares of our common stock by stockholders through our distribution reinvestment plan of   $77.7 million  . We also made scheduled and unscheduled mortgage principal installments totaling   $155.2 million  , paid   $30.2 million   for repurchase of shares pursuant to our redemption plan, and paid distributions of   $28.2 million   to affiliates that hold noncontrolling interests in various investments jointly-owned with us. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  Our objectives are to generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide stockholders with distributions and to seek investments with potential for capital appreciation throughout varying economic cycles. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling   $166.2 million  , which were comprised of   $89.1 million   of cash distributions and   $77.1 million   of distributions reinvested in our shares by stockholders through our distribution reinvestment plan. We funded   91.3%   of these distributions from Net cash provided by operating activities, with the remainder funded from other investing and financing cash flows. Since inception, we have funded   97.4%   of our cumulative distributions from Net cash provided by operating activities, with the remaining   2.6%  , or   $30.4 million  , being funded primarily from proceeds of our public offerings and, to a lesser extent, other sources. As we have fully invested the proceeds of our offerings, we expect that in the future, if distributions cannot be fully sourced from Net cash provided by operating activities, they may be sourced from the proceeds of financings or the sales of assets.  In determining our distribution policy during the periods in which we are investing capital, we place primary emphasis on projections of cash flow from operations, together with cash distributions from our unconsolidated investments, rather than on historical results of operations (though these and other factors may be a part of our consideration). Thus, in setting a distribution rate, we focus primarily on expected returns from those investments we have made, as well as our anticipated rate of return from future investments, to assess the sustainability of a particular distribution rate over time.

Redemptions 
    
  We maintain a quarterly redemption program pursuant to which we may, at the discretion of our board of directors, redeem shares of our common stock from stockholders seeking liquidity. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received   902   requests to redeem   3,157,473   shares of our common stock pursuant to our redemption plan, all of which were redeemed during the period. The weighted-average price per share at which the shares were redeemed was   $9.57  , which is net of redemptions fees, and totaled   $30.2 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received requests to redeem   3,089,139   shares of common stock pursuant to our redemption plan, all of which were redeemed during the period. The weighted-average price per share at which these shares were redeemed was   $9.16  , which is net of redemption fees, and totaled   $28.3 million  . 

Summary of Financing 
    
  The table below summarizes our non-recourse debt and Senior Credit Facility (dollars in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    In accordance with ASU 2015-03, we reclassified deferred financing costs from Other assets, net to Non-recourse debt, net and the Term Loan included in Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net as of   December 31, 2015   (   Note 2   ). 
              (b) 
    The impact of our derivative instruments is reflected in the weighted-average interest rates.  

Cash Resources 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our cash resources consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents totaling   $310.7 million  . Of this amount,   $29.7 million  , at then-current exchange rates, was held in foreign subsidiaries, but we could be subject to restrictions or significant costs should we decide to repatriate these amounts. We also had our Senior Credit Facility with unused capacity of   $200.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Our cash resources may be used for future investments and can be used for working capital needs, other commitments, and distributions to our stockholders. 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         54 

Cash Requirements 
    
  During the next 12 months, we expect that our cash requirements will include payments to acquire new investments; funding capital commitments such as build-to-suit projects and ADC Arrangements; paying distributions to our stockholders and to our affiliates that hold noncontrolling interests in entities we control; making share repurchases pursuant to our quarterly redemption program; and making scheduled debt service payments and repayments of borrowings under our Revolver; as well as other normal recurring operating expenses. Balloon payments totaling   $430.1 million   and   $94.0 million   on our consolidated and unconsolidated non-recourse mortgage loan obligations, respectively, are also due during the next 12 months. Our Advisor is actively seeking to refinance certain of these loans, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Capital and other lease commitments totaling   $12.9 million   are expected to be funded during the next 12 months. We expect to fund future investments, capital commitments, any capital expenditures on existing properties, scheduled and unscheduled debt payments on our mortgage loans, and repayments of borrowings under our Revolver through the use of our cash reserves, cash generated from operations, and proceeds from repayments of notes receivable, financings and asset sales. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
    
  The table below summarizes our debt, off-balance sheet arrangements, and other contractual obligations (primarily our capital commitments and lease obligations) at   September 30, 2016  , and the effect that these arrangements and obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the specified future periods (in thousands):   

  __________ 
           (a) 
    Excludes deferred financing costs totaling   $10.2 million   and unamortized discount, net of   $4.1 million   on   11   notes, which were included in Non-recourse debt at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (b) 
    Includes   $180.6 million   of debt that matured on September 28, 2016, however, we are in negotiations with the same lenders to refinance the outstanding debt, which is expected to occur before December 31, 2016. 
              (c) 
    Excludes deferred financing costs totaling   $0.2 million   and unamortized discount of less than   $0.1 million   on our Senior Credit Facility, which is scheduled to mature on August 26, 2018, unless extended by us pursuant to its terms. 
              (d) 
    Capital commitments include (i) construction commitments related to build-to-suit projects placed in service of   $9.7 million   (   Note 4   ), and (ii)   $0.3 million   related to unfunded tenant improvements. 
              (e) 
    Operating commitments consist of rental obligations under ground leases. Other lease commitments consist of our estimated share of future rents payable for the purpose of leasing office space pursuant to the advisory agreement. Amounts are estimated based on current allocation percentages among WPC and the other Managed Programs as of   September 30, 2016   (   Note 3   ). 
              (f) 
    Represents the estimated amount of future obligations estimated for the removal of asbestos and environmental waste in connection with several of our investments, payable upon the retirement or sale of the assets. 
       
  Amounts in the table above that relate to our foreign operations are based on the exchange rate of the local currencies at   September 30, 2016  , which consisted primarily of the euro. At   September 30, 2016  , we had no material capital lease obligations for which we were the lessee, either individually or in the aggregate. 
    
  Equity Method Investments 
    
  We have interests in unconsolidated investments that own single-tenant properties net leased to companies. Generally, the underlying investments are jointly-owned with our affiliates (   Note 6   ). At   September 30, 2016  , on a combined basis, these  

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         55 

investments had total assets of approximately   $4.2 billion   and third-party non-recourse mortgage debt of   $2.5 billion  . At that date, our pro rata share of the aggregate debt for these investments was   $494.5 million  . Cash requirements with respect to our share of these debt obligations are discussed above under Cash Requirements. 

Supplemental Financial Measures 
    
  In the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. Additionally, in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our strategies, we use FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies. A description of FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided below. 
    
  FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO 
    
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to nor a substitute for net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
    
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly-owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly-owned investments are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above. However, NAREIT s definition of FFO does not distinguish between the conventional method of equity accounting and the hypothetical liquidation at book value method of accounting for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly-owned investments. 
    
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment, and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization, as well as impairment charges of real estate-related assets, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management; and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist. Then a two-step process is performed, of which first is to determine whether an asset is impaired by comparing the carrying value, or book value, to the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset, then measure the impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value over its estimated fair value. It should be noted, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property (including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows) are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO described above due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. However, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating the  

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         56 

operating performance of the company. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO. 
    
  Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) were put into effect in 2009. These changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, such as acquisition fees that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. We currently intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of our assets, or another similar transaction) within eight to 12 years following the investment of substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering, which occurred in April 2011. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the Investment Program Association has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate non-GAAP measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO, and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance now that our offering has been completed and once essentially all of our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance, with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of a company s operating performance after a company s offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on a company s operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired. 
    
  We define MFFO consistent with the Investment Program Association s   Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations  , or the Practice Guideline, issued by the Investment Program Association in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, included in the determination of GAAP net income, as applicable: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments (i.e., infrequent or unusual, not reasonably likely to recur in the ordinary course of business); mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives, or securities holdings, where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and jointly-owned investments, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses that are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. 
    
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the Investment Program Association s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization of above- and below-market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables, and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.  

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         57 

These expenses are paid in cash by a company. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by the company, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses, and other costs related to such property. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. 
    
  Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs, which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that takes into account certain characteristics unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, defined acquisition period, and targeted exit strategy, and is therefore a useful measure for investors. For example, acquisition costs are generally funded from the proceeds of our offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information. 
    
  In addition, our management uses an adjusted MFFO, Adjusted MFFO, as another measure of sustainable operating performance. Adjusted MFFO adjusts MFFO for deferred income tax expenses and benefits, which are non-cash items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on current period cash flows. Additionally, we adjust MFFO to reflect the realized gains/losses on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives to arrive at Adjusted MFFO. Foreign currency derivatives are a fundamental part of our operations in that they help us manage the foreign currency exposure we have associated with cash flows from our international investments. 
    
  Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. 
    
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO, MFFO or Adjusted MFFO accordingly.

FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO were as follows (in thousands): 

__________ 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         59 

(a) 
    Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using an accrual basis. This may result in timing of income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), management believes that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, provides insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance. 
              (b) 
    Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO. However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that, by excluding charges relating to amortization of these intangibles, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. 
              (c) 
    In evaluating investments in real estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income, a performance measure under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to stockholders, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. 
              (d) 
    Gain on change in control of interests for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   represents a gain recognized on our acquisition of a 15% controlling interest in five self-storage properties, which we had previously accounted for as an equity method investment (   Note 4   ). 
              (e) 
    Impairment charges were incurred on our CMBS portfolio and are considered non-real estate impairments. As such, these impairment charges were not included as an add back adjustment in our computation of FFO, as defined by NAREIT, but are included as an adjustment in arriving at MFFO and Adjusted MFFO because these charges are not directly related or attributable to our operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. The primary risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. We are also exposed to further market risk as a result of tenant concentrations in certain industries and/or geographic regions, since adverse market factors can affect the ability of tenants in a particular industry/region to meet their respective lease obligations. In order to manage this risk, our Advisor views our collective tenant roster as a portfolio and attempts to diversify such portfolio so that we are not overexposed to a particular industry or geographic region. 
    
  Generally, we do not use derivative instruments to hedge credit/market risks or for speculative purposes. However, from time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars to hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The values of our real estate, related fixed-rate debt obligations, our Senior Credit Facility, and our loans receivable investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates. The value of our real estate is also subject to fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees, which may affect our ability to refinance property-level mortgage debt when balloon payments are scheduled, if we do not choose to repay the debt when due. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. An increase in interest rates would likely cause the fair value of assets to decrease. Increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit profile of certain tenants. 
    
  We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we have historically attempted to obtain non-recourse mortgage financing on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. However, from time to time, we or our joint investment partners have obtained, and may in the future obtain, variable-rate non-recourse mortgage loans, and, as a result, we have entered into, and may continue to enter into, swaptions, interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements with lenders. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the variable-rate debt service obligations of a loan to a fixed rate, while interest rate cap agreements limit the underlying interest rate from exceeding a specified strike rate. Interest rate swaps are agreements in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for a counterparty s stream of cash flows over a specific period, and interest rate caps limit the effective borrowing rate of variable-rate debt obligations while allowing participants to share in downward shifts in interest rates. These interest rate swaps and caps are derivative instruments that, where applicable, are designated as cash flow hedges on the forecasted interest payments on the debt obligation. The face amount on which the swaps or caps are based is not exchanged. A swaption is an option that gives us the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap under which we would pay a fixed-rate and receive a variable-rate.  At the option s expiration, we may also elect to cash settle the option if such option is  in-the-money  or allow the option to expire at no additional cost to us. Our objective in using these derivatives is to limit our exposure to interest rate movements. At   September 30, 2016  , we estimated that the total fair value of our interest rate swaps, which are included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, was in a liability position of   $11.0 million   (   Note 9   ). 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our debt either bore interest at fixed rates, bore interest at floating rates, was swapped or capped to a fixed rate, or bore interest at fixed rates that were scheduled to convert to then-prevailing market fixed rates at certain future points during their term. The annual interest rates on our fixed-rate debt at   September 30, 2016   ranged from   1.9%   to   10.9%  . The contractual annual interest rates on our variable-rate debt at   September 30, 2016   ranged from   1.3%   to   6.0%  . Our debt obligations are more fully described under    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Summary of Financing    in Item 2 above. The following table presents principal cash outflows for the remainder of   2016  , each of the next four calendar years following   December 31, 2016  , and thereafter, based upon expected maturity dates of our debt obligations outstanding at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Amounts are based on the exchange rate at   September 30, 2016  , as applicable. 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         61 

(b) 
    Includes the   $50.0 million   delayed draw of our Term Loan, which is scheduled to mature on August 26,   2018  , unless extended by us pursuant to its terms. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt and our variable-rate debt that currently bears interest at fixed rates, or has effectively been converted to a fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, or that has been subject to interest rate caps, is affected by changes in interest rates. A decrease or increase in interest rates of 1% would change the estimated fair value of this debt at   September 30, 2016   by an aggregate increase of   $54.0 million   or an aggregate decrease of   $69.6 million  , respectively. Annual interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt that does not bear interest at fixed rates at   September 30, 2016   would increase or decrease by   $3.5 million   for each respective 1% change in annual interest rates. 
    
  As more fully described under    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Summary of Financing    in Item 2 above, our variable-rate debt in the table above bore interest at fixed rates at   September 30, 2016  , but has interest rate reset features that will change the fixed interest rates to then-prevailing market fixed rates at certain points during their term. This debt is generally not subject to short-term fluctuations in interest rates. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  We own international investments, primarily in Europe and Asia, and as a result, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in various foreign currencies, primarily the euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Norwegian krone, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Although all of our foreign investments through the   third   quarter of   2016   were conducted in these currencies, we may conduct business in other currencies in the future. We manage foreign currency exchange rate movements by generally placing both our debt service obligation to the lender and the tenant s rental obligation to us in the same currency. This reduces our overall exposure to the actual equity that we have invested and the equity portion of our cash flow. In addition, we may use currency hedging to further reduce the exposure to our equity cash flow. We are generally a net receiver of these currencies (we receive more cash than we pay out), therefore our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, relative to the foreign currency. 
    
  We have obtained, and may in the future obtain, non-recourse mortgage financing in local currencies. To the extent that currency fluctuations increase or decrease rental revenues, as translated to U.S. dollars, the change in debt service, as translated to U.S. dollars, will partially offset the effect of fluctuations in revenue and, to some extent, mitigate the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  The June 23, 2016 referendum by voters in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, a process commonly referred to as  Brexit,  adversely impacted global markets, including the respective currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound sterling and to a lesser extent, the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. In October 2016, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced that the formal withdrawal process would be triggered in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, the end-of-period rate for the U.S. dollar in relation to the British pound sterling at October 31, 2016 decreased by 6.2% to $1.2155 from $1.2962 at September 30, 2016. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue as the United Kingdom negotiates its likely exit from the European Union. 
    
  Any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations.  Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results.   
    
  Scheduled future minimum rents, exclusive of renewals, under non-cancelable operating leases for our consolidated foreign operations as of   September 30, 2016  , during the remainder of   2016  , each of the next four calendar years following   December 31, 2016  , and thereafter, are as follows (in thousands): 

CPA       :17   Global 9/30/2016 10-Q         62 

Scheduled debt service payments (principal and interest) for mortgage notes payable, with regard to our consolidated foreign operations, as of   September 30, 2016  , during the remainder of   2016  , each of the next four calendar years following   December 31, 2016  , and thereafter, are as follows (in thousands): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Amounts are based on the applicable exchange rates at   September 30, 2016  . Contractual rents and debt obligations are denominated in the functional currency of the country of each property. Our foreign operations denominated in the Norwegian krone and Indian rupee are related to an unconsolidated jointly-owned investment and a foreign debenture, respectively, and are excluded from the amounts in the tables. 
              (b) 
    We estimate that, for a 1% increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar, there would be a corresponding change in the projected estimated property-level cash flow at   September 30, 2016   of   $6.5 million  . 
              (c) 
    We estimate that, for a 1% increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, there would be a corresponding change in the projected estimated property-level cash flow at   September 30, 2016   of   $0.4 million  . 
              (d) 
    We estimate that, for a 1% increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, there would be a corresponding change in the projected estimated property-level cash flow at   September 30, 2016   of less than   $0.1 million  . 
              (e) 
    Interest on unhedged variable-rate debt obligations was calculated using the applicable annual interest rates and balances outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  As a result of scheduled balloon payments on certain of our international non-recourse mortgage loans, projected debt service obligations exceed projected lease revenues in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, balloon payments totaling   $192.2 million   are due on   two   non-recourse mortgage loans, which includes   $180.6 million   of debt that matured on September 28, 2016, however, we are in negotiations with the same lenders to refinance the outstanding debt, which is expected to occur before December 31, 2016. In 2017, balloon payments totaling   $138.9 million   are due on   eight   non-recourse mortgage loans, of which a payment of   $25.7 million   on   one   loan was collateralized by properties that we own with affiliates. We currently anticipate that, by their respective due dates, we will have refinanced certain of these loans, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. If refinancing has not occurred, we would expect to use our cash resources to make these payments, if necessary. 
    
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities or have similar economic risks or conditions that could cause them to default on their lease obligations to us. We regularly monitor our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risk. While we believe our portfolio is reasonably well diversified, it does contain concentrations in certain areas in excess of 10%, based on the percentage of our consolidated total revenues or ABR. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our consolidated portfolio had the following significant characteristics in excess of 10%, based on the percentage of our consolidated total revenues: 

73%   related to domestic properties, which included a concentration in Texas of   14%  , and 
                
    27%   related to international properties. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated net-lease portfolio, which excludes investments within our Self-Storage and All Other segments, had the following significant property and lease characteristics in excess of 10% in certain areas, based on the percentage of our consolidated ABR as of that date: 

66%   related to domestic properties; 
                
    34%   related to international properties; 
                
    32%   related to office facilities,   24%   related to retail facilities,   23%   related to warehouse facilities, and   16%   related to industrial facilities; and 
                
    27%   related to the retail stores industry and   12%   related to the business services industry.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our disclosure controls and procedures include internal controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this and other reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that no system of controls can provide complete assurance of achieving a company s objectives and that future events may impact the effectiveness of a system of controls. 
    
  Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after conducting an evaluation, together with members of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of   September 30, 2016   at a reasonable level of assurance. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   368,291   shares of our common stock to our Advisor as consideration for asset management fees. These shares were issued at   $10.24   per share, which represents our most recently published NAV as approved by our board of directors at the date of issuance. Since none of these transactions were considered to have involved a  public offering  within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, the shares issued were deemed to be exempt from registration. In acquiring our shares, our Advisor represented that such interests were being acquired by it for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have issued a total of   11,510,492   shares of our common stock to our Advisor as consideration for asset management fees.

The maximum amount of shares purchasable by us in any period depends on a number of factors and is at the discretion of our board of directors. We generally receive fees in connection with share redemptions. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received   308   redemption requests for common stock, which were satisfied during that period.
