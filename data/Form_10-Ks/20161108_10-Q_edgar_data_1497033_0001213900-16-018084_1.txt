NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements of Wintahenderson International, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's registration statement
filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected
herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year 2016 as reported in Form 10-K, have been omitted. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established
an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management s Plan to Continue as a Going Concern  

The Company has met its historical working capital
requirements from the sale of its capital shares and loans from shareholders. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to obtain such resources for the Company
include (1) obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses, and
(2) seeking out and completing a merger with an existing operating company. However, management cannot provide any assurance that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other
sources of financing and attain profitable operations. In order to minimize the financial burden on the Company, the Company s
CEO, has agreed to provide non-interest bearing demand loans to the Company to pay the Company s annual audit fees, filing
costs, legal fees and other costs as long as the Board of Directors of the Company deem it necessary. The Company will account
for each such payment as a demand loan and, accordingly, be recorded as a current liability on the Company s books. There
can be no assurance that such financial support shall be ongoing or available on terms or conditions acceptable to the Company. 

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

For the quarter ended September 20, 2016, the President
loaned $10,000 to the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the President loaned $131,611 to the Company. This loan is unsecured,
noninterest bearing, and due on demand. 

Item
2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation   

The
following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our
results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto.
The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements.  

Plan
of Operation    

We
were organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the
perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond
such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings.  We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury or with additional amounts, as necessary,
to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  

During
the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  

(i)  
      filing
    of Exchange Act reports, and   

(ii)  
      consummating
    an acquisition.   

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned
by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  

We
have negative working capital, negative stockholders  equity and have not earned any revenues from operations to date. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting its efforts to
locating merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources
of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations.  

We
may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion
into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve
the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish
a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of
voting control which may occur in a public offering.  

Our
officers and directors have not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding
a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its
early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we
will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential
emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a
high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  

Our
management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.  

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

Results
of Operation    

We have not had any operating income
since inception.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred a net loss of $6,418 and $7,814,
respectively, and since inception, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $147,306. Expenses were comprised of costs mainly
associated with legal, accounting and office expense. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

At
September 30, 2016, we had no capital resources and we will need additional capital to continue operations for the next twelve
months. We intend to rely upon the issuance of common stock and loans from shareholders to fund administrative expenses pending
acquisition of an operating company.  However, our shareholders are under no obligation to provide such funding.  

Management
anticipates seeking out a target company through solicitation. Such solicitation may include newspaper or magazine advertisements,
mailings and other distributions to law firms, accounting firms, investment bankers, financial advisors and similar persons, the
use of one or more World Wide Web sites and similar methods. No estimate can be made as to the number of persons who will be contacted
or solicited. Management may engage in such solicitation directly or may employ one or more other entities to conduct or assist
in such solicitation. Management and its affiliates will pay referral fees to consultants and others who refer target businesses
for mergers into public companies in which management and its affiliates have an interest. Payments are made if a business combination
occurs, and may consist of cash or a portion of the stock in the Company retained by management and its affiliates, or both.  

Net
cash used in operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $(5,768) as compared to $(7,614) for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

There
was no cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,000 compared to $8,500 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $147,306 from inception and a working capital
deficit of $130,738 at September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company's ability to raise additional capital and implement
its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.  

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern  

Allan
Schwartz will supervise the search for target companies as potential candidates for a business combination. Allan Schwartz will
pay, at his own expense, any costs he incurs in supervising the search for a target company. Allan Schwartz may enter into agreements
with other consultants to assist in locating a target company and may share stock received by it or cash resulting from the sale
of its securities with such other consultants. Allan Schwartz controls us and therefore has the authority to enter into any agreement
binding us. Allan Schwartz as an officer, director and shareholder can authorize any such agreement binding us.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Currently, we do not believe that any accounting policies fit this definition.  

Off
Balance Sheet Transactions   

None.  

Item
3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

The Company is subject to certain market
risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.  The Company does not undertake any specific actions
to limit those exposures. We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. 

Item
4.     Controls and Procedures   

a)     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls.   As of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO )
and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this
report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more
fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial
reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside
directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated
by one individual without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Principal
Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an immediate negative effect on our financial results because
of our small size of operation. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a
majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements if the Company
were growing substantially in the future periods.  

(b)     Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.

are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
