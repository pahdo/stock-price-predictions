1. Business Overview 
    
  Company Description 
    
  Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated as Replidyne, Inc. ( Replidyne ) in Delaware in 2000. On February 25, 2009, Replidyne completed its business combination with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 3, 2008. At the effective time of the merger, Replidyne changed its name to Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.  
    
  The Company develops, manufactures and markets devices for the treatment of vascular diseases. The Company s peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360        Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) and the Stealth 360         Peripheral OAS, are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types, including calcified plaque, in leg arteries both above and below the knee, and address many of the limitations associated with other surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. These devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in a variety of vessel sizes, including the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin.  
    
  In October 2013, the Company received premarket approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market the Diamondback 360        Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries.  
    
  The Company is currently selling only in the United States and evaluating options for international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities. In June 2016, the Company submitted an application to Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for approval of our Diamondback 360        Coronary OAS Micro Crown. Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any of the Company s products.  

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  The Company prepared the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related unaudited financial information in the footnotes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial statements. The year-end consolidated balance sheet was derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures as required by GAAP. These interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the Company s consolidated financial position, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the interim periods. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated annual financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC on August 25, 2016. The nature of the Company s business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Table of Contents  

Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. Fair value of option awards is determined using option-pricing models, fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation, and fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or service conditions is determined by the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards expected to vest. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  The Company sells the majority of its products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales. 
    
  Costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized. Cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue From Customers With Contracts.  The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 was initially to be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods. Early adoption was not to be permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and allow early adoption for all entities but not before the original public entity effective date. The Company is evaluating the impact of the amended revenue recognition guidance on its financial statements.  
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The guidance requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. The entity must also provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption.  
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The guidance requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the deferred tax guidance on its financial statements upon adoption.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new lease guidance on its financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Stock Compensation.  The guidance simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, classification on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and transition requirements vary based on the amendments adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the stock compensation guidance on its financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which amends ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The guidance clarifies how entities would determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable from other promises in a contract and, therefore, would be accounted for separately. The guidance would also allow entities to disregard goods or services that are immaterial in the context of a contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs rather than as additional promised services. ASU 2016-10 has the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09, as amended by 2015-14. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which amends ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  to address implementation issues relative to transition (adding a practical expedient for contract modifications and clarifying what constitutes a completed contract when employing ASU 2014-09 s full or modified retrospective transition methods), collectability, noncash consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar-type taxes (allowing entities to exclude sales-type taxes collected from transaction price). This ASU has the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope. The new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the credit loss guidance on its financial statements.

Legal Settlement 
    
  On June 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with the United States of America, acting through the Department of Justice (the  DOJ ) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Travis Thams, to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action underlying such investigation. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company will pay   $8,000  , as follows: an initial payment of   $3,000  , which the Company paid on July 1, 2016, with the remaining   $5,000  , which bears interest at   1.8%   per annum, payable in   11   equal quarterly installments, beginning January 1, 2017. The amount payable within the next twelve months is included in accrued expenses as noted in the table above. 
    
  Restructuring 
    
  On March 31, 2016, the Company announced a restructuring to reduce costs as a part of its plan to progress towards profitability and positive cash flow.

     Table of Contents  

The Company anticipates that   $939   of the restructuring accrual at September 30, 2016 will be paid within the next twelve months and is therefore recorded in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. Estimated payments of   $87   are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company does not anticipate additional restructuring costs. 
    
  CEO Departure 
    
  On February 29, 2016, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) resigned from his positions as President and CEO of the Company and as a director of the Company. The Company and the former CEO entered into a Separation Agreement with benefits consistent with the Company s Amended and Restated Executive Officer Severance Plan. The total expense related to the former CEO s departure was   $1,507   and was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016,   $701   of the package benefits is recorded in accrued expenses and   $238   is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, representing the long-term portion of the former CEO s benefits. 
    
  Other Liabilities 
    
  Other non-current liabilities consist of the following: 

4. Deferred Compensation Plan 
    
  The Company offers certain members of management and highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer up to   100%   of their base salary (after 401(k), payroll tax and other deductions), performance bonus and discretionary bonus and elect to receive the deferred compensation at a fixed future date of participant s choosing. Each participant may, at the time of his or her deferral election, choose to allocate the deferred compensation into investment alternatives set by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. The amount payable to each participant under the plan will change in value based upon the investment selected by that participant and is classified as current or long-term on the Company's balance sheet based on the disbursement elections made by the participants. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $347   of the amount payable is included in accrued liabilities and   $358   is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Future distribution dates are July 1, 2017 and January 1, 2020. 
    
  The available-for-sale marketable securities are primarily comprised of investments with a fixed income and equity investments and consist of the following:  

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   $0   and   $17  , respectively, in purchases of available-for-sale securities. There were   no   sales or other-than-temporary impairments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides information by level for the Company's available-for-sale marketable securities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company's marketable securities classified within Level 1 are valued primarily using real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets. Marketable securities within Level 2 are valued using readily available pricing sources. There were   no   transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . Any transfers between levels would be recognized on the date of the event or when a change in circumstances causes a transfer. 

5. Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards 
    
  The Company maintains the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) for the purpose of granting equity awards to employees, directors and consultants. The 2014 Plan was approved by the Company s stockholders and became effective in November 2014 and subsequently amended in May 2015. The 2014 Plan replaced the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ), and no further equity awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. The Company also maintains one other terminated plan, the 2003 Stock Option Plan (the  2003 Plan ) (the 2014 Plan, the 2007 Plan, and the 2003 Plan are collectively referred to as the  Plans ).  
    
  Stock Options 
    
  All options granted under the Plans become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant. The option exercise price is generally not less than the estimated fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant, as determined by the Company s management and Board of Directors. In addition, the Company has granted nonqualified stock options to a director outside of the Plans. An employee's vested options must be exercised at or within   90 days   of termination to avoid forfeiture. As of   September 30, 2016  , all outstanding options were fully vested.  
    
  Stock option activity for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:   

Restricted Stock 
    
  For restricted stock awards which vest solely based on time, the fair value of each restricted stock award is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. Vesting of restricted stock awards generally ranges from   one   to   three years  . The estimated fair value of restricted stock awards, including the effect of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the restricted stock s vesting period. 

12 

     Table of Contents  

On August 8, 2016 and August 17, 2016, the Company granted restricted stock awards to its executives and management.  These awards included grants of an aggregate maximum   336,826   shares that vest based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to total shareholder return of the Company s peer group, as measured by the closing prices of the stock of the Company and the peer group members for the 90 trading days preceding July 1, 2016 compared to the closing prices of the stock of the Company and the peer group members for the 90 trading days preceding July 1, 2019. Vesting of these awards will be determined on the date that the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 is filed. 
    
  To calculate the estimated fair value of these restricted stock awards with market conditions, the Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation, which uses the expected average stock prices to estimate the expected number of shares that will vest. The Monte Carlo simulation resulted in a fair value of approximately   $4,032  , which the Company will recognize as expense using the straight-line method over the period that the awards are expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense related to an award with a market condition will be recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.  
    
  Restricted stock award activity for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

6. Commitment and Contingencies 
    
  Operating Leases

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
       
  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing under Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this quarterly report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and expected financial results, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the  Risk Factors  discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for vascular and coronary disease. Our peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) products, the Diamondback 360        Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System ( OAS ) ( Diamondback 360 Peripheral ), the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral OAS, the Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral OAS, and the Stealth 360        Peripheral OAS ( Stealth 360 ), are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. The micro-invasive devices use smaller access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee through alternative access sites in the ankle and foot as well as in the groin. We refer to each of the products above in this report as the  Peripheral OAS.   
    
  Our coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) product, Diamondback 360        Coronary OAS ( Coronary OAS ), is marketed as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries. The Coronary OAS is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions. The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application.  
    
  From 1989 to 1997, we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts. Since 1997, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the Peripheral OAS and, since 2007, to the approval of our Coronary OAS.  
    
  In 2006, we obtained an investigational device exemption from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to conduct our pivotal OASIS PAD clinical trial, which was completed in January 2007. The OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions. 
    
  In August 2007, the FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD. We commenced commercial introduction of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in the United States in September 2007. We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011. We no longer market the Predator 360. We received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral OAS in March 2014; in April 2015, we received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 4 French 1.25 Peripheral OAS, and in October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance of the Diamondback 360 1.50 and 2.00 Peripheral OAS.  
    
  We have developed modified versions of the Peripheral OAS to treat coronary arteries. A coronary application required us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket approval ( PMA ) application, and obtain approval from the FDA. In March 2013, we completed submission of our PMA application to the FDA for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries. In October 2013, we received PMA from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries. We commenced a commercial launch of our Coronary OAS following receipt of PMA.  
    
  We market the Peripheral and Coronary OAS in the United States through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer. At our facilities, we assemble the saline infusion pump and the single-use catheter used in the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS with components purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as with components manufactured in-house. Supplemental products are purchased from third-party suppliers.

In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 device and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize our products in Europe.  
    
  In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) for approval of our Diamondback 360        Coronary OAS Micro Crown, our second generation coronary device. Pending approval, Japan would become the first international market for any CSI products. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
    
  Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation, are updated as appropriate at least quarterly. We use authoritative pronouncements, our technical accounting knowledge, cumulative business experience, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies. While we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate, these estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome. Therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates. 
    
  Some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Our critical accounting policies are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates." There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases:

     Table of Contents  

Comparison of   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   with   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net revenues.   Net revenues increased by $5.9 million, or   13.5%  , from   $43.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $49.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increase was attributable to higher sales of both our PAD and CAD Systems. CAD System revenues increased approximately $2.6 million, or 32.8%, due to 31.5% more devices sold in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   than during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Sales of our PAD System also increased $2.6 million, or 8.1%, due to 5.8% more devices sold in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   than during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , as well as an increase in average selling prices. Other product revenue increased by $653,000, or 19.8%, primarily driven by increased sales of our PAD and CAD Systems, which the other products support. 
    
  Currently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Japan and Europe. In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan s PMDA for approval of our Diamondback 360        Coronary OAS Micro Crown. In October 2014, we received CE Mark for the Stealth 360 and are currently evaluating the timing and structure of our plans to commercialize products in Europe. We expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices, increase the usage per physician, introduce new and improved products, generate additional clinical data, and expand into new geographies. 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold.   Cost of goods sold increased $695,000, or   7.9%  , from   $8.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $9.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Cost of goods sold represents the cost of materials, labor and overhead for single-use catheters, guidewires, saline pumps, and other ancillary products. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes $200,000 and $215,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased sales levels, partially offset by lower material costs. Gross margin increased to 81.0% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from 80.0% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to lower material costs and an increase in average selling prices. We expect that gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal   2017   will be comparable to gross margin in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Quarterly margin fluctuations could occur based on production volumes, timing of new product introductions, sales mix, pricing changes, or other unanticipated circumstances. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.5 million, or   10.9%  , from   $41.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $36.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses from a 6.3% decrease in headcount from the three months ended September 30, 2015, lower commissions expense, and a reduction in medical device excise tax expense due to the suspension of the tax effective January 1, 2016. Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in bonus expense due to our performance and increased legal fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes $3.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, for stock-based compensation, which decreased due to the decreased headcount. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to amounts incurred for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to lower event costs. 
    
  Research and Development Expenses.   Research and development expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or   23.1%  , from   $6.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Research and development expenses relate to specific projects to develop new products or expand into new markets, such as the development of new versions of the PAD and CAD Systems, shaft designs, crown designs, and to PAD and CAD clinical trials. The decrease primarily related to the completion of enrollment in several of our clinical studies. Research and development expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes $289,000 and $373,000, respectively, for stock-based compensation. We expect research and development expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be slightly higher than amounts incurred for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the timing of projects and studies. Fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  We had cash and cash equivalents of   $58.2 million   and   $60.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used in operations amounted to   $2.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an accumulated deficit of   $329.3 million  . We have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and debt.

Changes in Liquidity 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents were   $58.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $60.6 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The decrease is primarily attributable to net cash used in operations and investing activities during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Operating Activities.   Net cash used in operations was   $2.1 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had a net loss of   $1.9 million   and   $13.3 million  , respectively. Significant changes in working capital during these periods included: 

Cash provided by (used in) inventories was   $553,000   and   $(1.5) million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amount of cash provided by inventories was primarily due to lower inventory levels. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the amount of cash used in inventories was primarily due to higher levels of finished goods for future sales. 
                
    Cash provided by prepaid expenses and other current assets was   $1.3 million   and   $1.0 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, primarily due to payment timing of vendor deposits and other expenditures.  
                 
    Cash (used in) provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities was   $(6.4) million   and   $166,000   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in accrued expenses was primarily due to the initial $3.0 million Department of Justice settlement payment (discussed below), severance payments, and the amount and timing of compensation payments. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to the amount and timing of compensation payments. 
       
  Investing Activities  . Net cash used in investing activities was   $452,000   and   $2.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash was used primarily for the purchase of property and equipment and patents. Cash used during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the purchase of property and equipment and patents, as well as for the issuance of a convertible note receivable.  
    
  Financing Activities  . Net cash provided by financing activities was   $84,000   and   $19,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  
    
  Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs, working capital required to support our business operations, the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, our sales and marketing programs, the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, potential strategic transactions (including the potential acquisition of businesses, technologies and products), and the existence, defense and resolution of legal proceedings. As of September 30, 2016, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months, as well as to fund payments related to the Department of Justice settlement, expenses relating to implementation and compliance with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, and payments related to our restructuring and departure of our former CEO. We also believe we have the potential ability to finance our new Minnesota facility and obtain debt financing, which could further supplement funds if warranted. We intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Legal Settlement 
    
  As previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on August 25, 2016, on June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the Department of Justice, pursuant to which we will pay $8.0 million as follows: an initial payment of $3.0 million, which we paid in July 2016, with the remaining $5.0 million, which bears interest at 1.8% per annum, payable in 11 equal quarterly installments, beginning in January 2017.  
    
  In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the  Corporate Integrity Agreement ) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs. In the event of a breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs. The Corporate Integrity Agreement will require us to invest additional amounts in our compliance program and pay fees and expenses of the independent review organization. 
    
  Restructuring 
    
  In March 2016, we announced a broad-based restructuring to reduce costs as a part of our plan to progress towards profitability and positive cash flow. As a result, we recorded a restructuring expense of $2.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, which was comprised of severance and other employee related costs. Approximately   $939,000   is payable over the next twelve months and   $87,000   payable in subsequent periods. We do not anticipate additional restructuring costs. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion.  
    
  CEO Departure 
    
  In February 2016, our former Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) resigned from his positions as President and CEO of the Company and as a director of the Company. The Company and the former CEO entered into a Separation Agreement with benefits consistent with our Amended and Restated Executive Officer Severance Plan, which requires payments of approximately   $701,000   that will be paid within the next twelve months and estimated payments of   $238,000   primarily payable in the subsequent twelve months. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure referred to as  Adjusted EBITDA.  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands): 

Adjusted EBITDA improved as compared to the prior year period due to the lower loss from operations as a result of higher revenues and lower costs and higher depreciation expense, slightly offset by lower stock-based compensation as a result of reduced headcount.  

19 

     Table of Contents  

Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used and Usefulness of Such Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors 
    
  We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors  operating results. Additionally, our management is partially evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets. 
    
  We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results  through the eyes  of management. We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance. 
  The following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items: 

Stock-based compensation.   We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measure primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement. Our management also believes that excluding this item from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand the application of stock-based compensation guidance and its impact on our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the Company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. 
                
    Depreciation and amortization expense.   We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non-GAAP financial measure primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Our management also believes that excluding these items from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance and ability to make additional investments in the company. 
       
  Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in Which We Compensate for these Limitations 
    
  Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations associated with our use of these non-GAAP financial measures are: 

Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA, and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items. 
                
    Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
                
    Our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures we use. 
       
  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. 

INFLATION 
    
  We do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The primary objective of our investment activity is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or decreasing availability. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, and certain bank obligations. Our cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   include liquid money market accounts. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk.  
    
  Additionally, we have acquired certain available-for-sale marketable securities under our deferred compensation plan. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on these available-for-sale marketable securities and the related risks. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, referred to collectively herein as the Certifying Officers, are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. The Certifying Officers have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that review and evaluation, which included inquiries made to certain other employees of the Company, the Certifying Officers have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, are effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
