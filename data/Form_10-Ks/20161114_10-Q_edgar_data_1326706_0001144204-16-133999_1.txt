NOTE
                          1:-      GENERAL   

a.    NanoVibronix,
Inc. ( the Company ), a U.S. (Delaware) corporation, commenced operations on October 20, 2003 and is a medical device
company focusing on noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered
at home, without the assistance of medical professionals.  

The Company's principal research
and development activities are conducted in Israel through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NanoVibronix (Israel 2003) Ltd., a company
registered in Israel, which commenced operations in October 2003. 

b.  
      The Company s ability to continue to operate is dependent mainly on its ability to successfully market and sell its products and the receipt of additional financing until profitability is achieved. The Company has incurred losses in the amount of $1,711 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, has an accumulated deficit of $21,445 as of September 30, 2016 and has accumulated negative cash flow from operating activities amounted to $1,107 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The Company expects to continue incurring losses and negative flows from operations. As a result, the Company will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. During the next twelve months management expects that the Company will need to raise additional capital to finance its losses and negative cash flows from operations and may continue to be dependent on additional capital raising as long as its products do not reach commercial profitability. Management s plans include the continued commercialization of the Company s products and raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for its operations. If the Company is unsuccessful in commercializing its products and raising capital, it will need to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their classification that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   

c.  
      In the opinion of
    management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only
    normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Company.
    These consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the
    Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, as found in the Company s Annual
    Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. The balance sheet for December 31,
    2015 was derived from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of
    operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that could be
    expected for the entire fiscal year.   

NOTE 2:-   
       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

The significant accounting policies
applied in the annual consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2015 are applied consistently in these
financial statements. 

Recent accounting pronouncements: 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this
update change the accounting for certain stock-based compensation transactions, including the income tax consequences and cash
flow classification for applicable transactions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will
have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
( ASU 2016-13 ). The standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the
timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE
                          3:-      UNAUDITED
INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the
Company s consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the Company s consolidated results of operation
and the consolidated cash flows for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE
                          4:-      FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair
value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  U.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)  

ASC 820 also establishes a fair value
hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. 

Level 1 -  
      quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level 2 -  
      inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or   

Level 3 -  
      unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   

During February 2013, the Company signed
a convertible Promissory Notes agreement (the  Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company issued secured convertible
Promissory Notes (the  Notes ) to certain investors on February 5, 2013.  On each of March 28, 2013, June 3, 2013,
August 5, 2013, October 7, 2013, December 9, 2013, February 6, 2014, April 1, 2014, May 15, 2014, June 16, 2014, August 7, 2014,
September 7, 2014, October 13, 2014, November 19, 2014 and December 11, 2014, the Agreement and the Notes were amended and restated
to increase the principal amount by $100.  In addition, with each amendment, the Company issued to the holders of the Note
warrants to purchase up to 37,594 shares of common stock in consideration for an additional $100 per amendment. The exercise price
at which the warrants may be exercised is $2.66 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, fundamental transactions or
similar events including  down round  protection. The warrants expire within a period of five years, based on the issuance
date.  

In April 2015, the holders of the Notes
elected to convert the outstanding principal and interest thereunder into shares of the Company s series C preferred stock.
On that date, an aggregate principal balance of $1,500 and $106 in accrued interest were converted into 603,769 shares of series
C preferred stock.  The shares of series C preferred stock were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or the securities laws of any state, and were offered and sold pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

The Company measures the warrants at
fair value by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model in each reporting period until they are exercised or expired, with
changes in fair value being recognized in the Company s consolidated statement of comprehensive loss as financial income
or expense.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  U.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)  

In estimating the warrants' fair value,
the Company used the following assumptions: 

(1)  
      Dividend yield - was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to its stockholders in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its stockholders in the future.   

(2)  
      Expected volatility - was calculated based on actual historical stock price movements of companies in the same industry over a term that is equivalent to the expected term of the warrants.   

(3)  
      Risk-free interest   was based on yield rate of non-index linked U.S. Federal Reserve treasury stock.   

(4)  
      Expected term - was based on the maturity date of the warrants.   

Fair value measurement using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

In addition, the Company s financial
instruments also include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other accounts receivable, accounts
payable and other accounts payable. The fair value of these financial instruments was not materially different from their carrying
values as of September 30, 2016 due to the short-term maturities of such instruments. 

NOTE 5:-    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIENCY)  

a)   Issuance of restricted shares 

On July 18,
2016, the Company issued 9,000 restricted shares of Common stock, vesting over three months, to a consultant as part of the total
consideration for its services. 

b)   Stock based compensation 

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors granted 100,000 options to purchase ordinary shares of the Company
to its directors. The exercise price for such options is $5.35 per share, with vesting to occur over 1 year. 

The following
table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the options granted in the periods presented: 

Weighted average
fair value of options granted during the nine- month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $ 3.08 and $ 1.50, respectively. 

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded share based compensation in a total amount of $240 and $153,
respectively. 

As of September
30, 2016, the total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was
$565, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.17 years. 

NOTE
                          6:-      COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   

a.    The
Company leases office facilities and motor vehicles under operating leases, which expire on various dates, the latest of which
is 2017.  

Future minimum lease commitments under
non-cancelable operating lease agreements as of September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The Company leases
motor vehicles under cancelable lease agreements. The Company has an option to be released from this lease agreement, which
may result in penalties in a maximum amount of approximately $7. 

Rent and related expenses were $22
and $23 for the nine months, and $7 and $8 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Motor vehicle leases, and related expenses
were $12 and $12 for the nine months, and $7 and $1 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Under the Company's subsidiary research
and development agreements with the OCS and pursuant to applicable laws, the Company is required to pay royalties at the rate of
3-3.5% of sales of products developed with funds provided by the OCS, up to an amount equal to 100% of the OCS research and development

NOTE
                          7:-      LOSS
PER SHARE   

All outstanding share options and warrants
for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2015
have been excluded from the calculation of the diluted net loss per share because all such securities are anti-dilutive for all
periods presented. 

Retrospective adjustment of net
loss per share information   

The Company has shares of Series C
Preferred Stock outstanding which were issued in early 2015. The specific terms and conditions of the Series C Preferred Shares
are disclosed in Note 10 to the Company s December 31, 2015 audited consolidated financial statements which should be read
along with these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 

When preparing its consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, its interim consolidated financial statements for the respective quarters and
year to date periods contained during 2015, and also the interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March
31, 2016, the Company considered these convertible security to be a common stock equivalents but excluded them from its dilutive
earnings (loss) per share computation as it concluded that the securities would be anti-dilutive in nature if or when converted.
However, upon further analysis and when preparing it interim consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2016,
the Company has concluded that these securities participate equally with common shares in the profits, losses and liquidation values
of the Company, and while limited in voting they can be readily converted into voting common shares at any time. The Company has
concluded that they are participating securities that should have been included as a component of both basic and dilutive earnings
(loss) per share for all periods previously presented. Adjusted figures are presented below to reflect this revised conclusion. 

The Company has retrospectively
adjusted for the foregoing matter in the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Overview  

We are a medical device company focusing on
noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home,
without the assistance of medical professionals. Our WoundShield, PainShield  and UroShield  products are backed by novel
technology which relates to ultrasound delivery through surface acoustic waves. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

A critical accounting policy is one that
is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. There have not been any material changes
to such critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015. 

The currency of the primary economic environment
in which our operations are conducted is the U.S. dollar ( $  or  dollar ). Accordingly, our functional
currency is the dollar. 

Results of Operations  

Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Nine months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues . For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were approximately $180,000 and $108,000, respectively, an increase of approximately 67%, or $72,000,
between the periods. The increase was mainly attributable to increased sales from adding distributors as well as having positive
results from our increased marketing campaigns. Our revenues may fluctuate as we add new customers or when existing customers make
large purchases of our products during one period and no purchases during another period. Our revenues may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter
and, as we continue to grow our business, growth in revenues by quarter may not be linear or consistent. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the percentage of revenues attributable to our products was: PainShield - 89% and UroShield - 11%. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the percentage of revenues attributable to our products was: PainShield - 94% and UroShield - 6%. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of revenues attributable to the disposable units of our PainShield and UroShield
products was 45% and 41%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the portion of our revenues that
was derived from distributors was 34% and 27%, respectively. 

Gross
Profit . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit increased by approximately 41%, or $30,000, to
approximately $103,000 from approximately $73,000 during the same period in 2015. The increase was due to the increase in
revenues. 

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was approximately 57% and 68% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage is mainly due to the increased percentage of distributor
sales which typically carry a lower gross profit percentage than our direct to consumer sales. 

Research and Development Expenses . For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, research and development expenses were approximately $447,000 and $297,000,
respectively, an increase of approximately 51%, or $150,000, between the periods. This increase was mainly due to an increased
volume of clinical trial costs that took place in 2016 as well as increased development of new products. 

Our research and development expenses consist
mainly of payroll expenses to employees involved in research and development activities, stock-based compensation expenses, expenses
related to subcontracting, patents application and registration, clinical trial and facilities expenses associated with and allocated
to research and development activities. 

Research and development expenses as a percentage
of total revenues were approximately 248% and 275% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease
was due primarily to the increase in revenues which was offset by the increased activity described above. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses . For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $390,000 and $207,000, respectively,
an increase of approximately 88%, or $183,000, between the periods. The increase was mainly due to an increase in selling and marketing
activities, particularly increased trade show expenses as well as a favorable debt settlement which reduced costs by $75,000 in
2015. 

Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage
of total revenues were approximately 217% and 192% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase
was due primarily to the increase in revenues and the increase in trade show expenses described above. 

General and Administrative Expenses  For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were approximately $741,000 and $533,000,
respectively, an increase of approximately 39%, or $208,000, between the periods. The increase was mainly due to the costs and
increased professional fees associated with our becoming a public company. 

Our general and administrative expenses consist
mainly of payroll expenses for management and administrative employees, share-based compensation expenses, accounting, legal and
facilities expenses associated with general and administrative activities. 

Financial Expenses net . For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, financial expenses, net were approximately $209,000 and $1,112,000, respectively, a decrease
of approximately 81%, or $904,000, between the periods. The decrease resulted primarily from the lower valuation adjustment of
our warrants that were issued with our 2013 and 2015 convertible promissory notes. 

Tax expenses.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, tax expenses were $28,000 and $27,000, respectively. The tax expense is computed by multiplying income
before taxes at our Israeli subsidiary by the appropriate tax rate.  

Net Loss.  Our net loss decreased by approximately
$392,000, or 18%, to approximately $1,711,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $2,103,000 in the
same period of 2015. The increase in net loss resulted primarily from the factors described above. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues . For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were approximately $61,000 and $40,000, respectively, an increase of approximately 53%,
or $21,000, between the periods. The increase was mainly attributable to increased sales from adding distributors as well as having
positive results from our increased marketing campaigns. Our revenues may fluctuate as we add new customers or when existing customers
make large purchases of our products during one period and no purchases during another period. Our revenues may fluctuate from
quarter-to-quarter and, as we continue to grow our business, growth in revenues by quarter may not be linear or consistent. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the percentage of revenues attributable to our products was: PainShield - 82% and UroShield - 18%. For the three months ended September
30, 2015, the percentage of revenues attributable to our products was: PainShield - 98% and UroShield - 2%. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of revenues attributable to the disposable units of our PainShield and UroShield
products was 38% and 45%, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the portion of our revenues that
was derived from distributors was 36% and 32%, respectively. 

Gross Profi t. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, gross profit increased by approximately 13%, or $4,000, to approximately $34,000 from approximately $30,000
during the same period in 2015. The increase was due to the increase in revenues. 

Gross profit
as a percentage of revenues was approximately 56% and 75% for the three months September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease in gross profit as a percentage is mainly due to the increased percentage of distributor sales which typically carry
a lower gross profit percentage than our direct to consumer sales.  

Research and Development Expenses . For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, research and development expenses were approximately $161,000 and $87,000,
respectively, an increase of approximately 85%, or $74,000, between the periods. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage is mainly due to the increased percentage of distributor
sales which typically carry a lower gross profit percentage than our direct to consumer sales. 

Our research and development expenses consist
mainly of payroll expenses to employees involved in research and development activities, stock-based compensation expenses, expenses
related to subcontracting, patents application and registration, clinical trial and facilities expenses associated with and allocated
to research and development activities. 

Research and development expenses as a percentage
of total revenues were approximately 264% and 218% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase
was primarily due to the increase in expenses related to our clinical trials. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses . For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $119,000 and $73,000, respectively,
an increase of approximately 63%, or $46,000, between the periods. The increase was mainly due to an increase in selling and marketing
activities, particularly increased salaries and marketing expenses. 

Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage
of total revenues were approximately 197% and 183% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase
was due primarily to the increase in revenues. 

Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly
of payroll expenses to direct sales and marketing employees, stock-based compensation expenses, travel expenses, advertising and
marketing expenses, rent and facilities expenses associated with and allocated to selling and marketing activities. 

General and Administrative Expenses .
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were approximately $298,000 and $208,000,
respectively, an increase of approximately 43%, or $90,000, between the periods. The increase was mainly due to the costs and increased
professional fees associated with our becoming a public company. 

Our general and administrative expenses consist
mainly of payroll expenses for management and administrative employees, share-based compensation expenses, accounting, legal and
facilities expenses associated with general and administrative activities. 

Financial Expenses, net . For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net were approximately $52,000 and $683,000, respectively, a decrease of approximately
92%, or $631,000, between the periods. The decrease resulted primarily from the higher valuation adjustment of our warrants that
were issued with our 2013 and 2015 convertible promissory notes. 

Tax
expenses.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, tax expenses were $9,000 and $18,000, respectively. The
tax expenses are attributed to our Israel subsidiary. 

Net Loss.  Our net loss decreased by approximately
$432,000, or 42%, to approximately $607,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $1,039,000 in the
same period of 2015. The decrease in net loss resulted primarily from the factors described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We continue to incur losses and negative
cash flows from operating activities. We have incurred losses in the amount of $1,711,000 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, and have accumulated negative cash flow from operating activities of $1,107,000 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016. We expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and as a result, we will not
have sufficient resources to fund our operation for the next twelve months. These conditions raise doubts about our ability to
continue as a going concern. During the next twelve months management expects that the Company will need to raise additional capital
to finance its losses and negative cash flows from operations for the next twelve months and may continue to be dependent on additional
capital raising as long as our products do not reach commercial profitability. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
and through November 14, 2016, we met our short-term liquidity requirements from our existing cash reserves. Our future capital
requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize
our products, our development of future products and competing technological and market developments. We intend to continue to
use our existing cash reserves use to meet our short-term liquidity requirements as well as to advance our long-term plans. It
is our current belief that if we do not continue to see significant increases in revenues, or if we are unable to raise additional
capital at a later time in the current year, we will need to reduce our operating budget as well as sales and marketing expenses
which may impair our ability to execute our business objectives. It should also be noted that there are no assurances that we would
be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us. 

Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to nine months Ended September 30, 2015   

General . As of September 30, 2016, we
had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $532,000, compared to approximately $1,614,000 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease
is attributable primarily to our net cash used in operating activities. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination
of issuance of equity, borrowing activities and sales. Our cash requirements are generally for product development, research and
development cost, marketing and sales activities, finance and administrative cost, capital expenditures and general working capital. 

Cash used in our operating activities was approximately
$1,107,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,100,000 for the same period in 2015.  

Cash used in investing activities was $8,000
and $1,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was related to purchases of fixed assets. 

Cash provided by financing activities was approximately
$33,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 derived from proceeds received on the exercise of options and $3,005,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which derived from issuance of shares of common stock, series C preferred stock and warrants
to purchase shares of common stock for aggregate consideration of $3,005,000, which is net of issuance costs of $145,000. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, we have no off-balance
sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities
or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Factors That May Affect Future Operations  

We believe that our future operating results
will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors, including the ordering patterns of our
distributors, timing of regulatory approvals, the implementation of various phases of our clinical trials and manufacturing efficiencies
due to the learning curve of utilizing new materials and equipment. Our operating results could also be impacted by a weakening
of the Euro and strengthening of the New Israeli Shekel, or NIS, both against the U.S. dollar. Lastly, other economic conditions
we cannot foresee may affect customer demand, such as individual country reimbursement policies pertaining to our products.

Not applicable. 

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures    

(a)  
      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2016, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.   

Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level
as of September 30, 2016. 

(b)  
      Changes in Internal Controls. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
