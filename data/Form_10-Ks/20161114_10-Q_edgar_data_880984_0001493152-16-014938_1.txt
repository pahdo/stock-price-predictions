NOTE
1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND LIQUIDITY   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Acorn Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company )
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. All dollar amounts in the notes to the condensed
consolidated financial statements are in thousands except for per share data.  

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015 to conform to the current period s condensed consolidated financial statement presentation. These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

On
April 21, 2016, the Company closed on a transaction for the sale of a portion of its interests in DSIT Solutions, Ltd. (see Note
3). As a result of the transaction, the Company s holdings in DSIT were reduced from 78.7% (on a fully diluted basis) to
41.2% and, subsequent to the DSIT Transaction, the Company has limited representation on the DSIT Board of directors. Accordingly,
following the sale, the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT. Operating results for DSIT through April 21, 2016
are consolidated in continuing operations while the Company s share of DSIT s results for the period from April 22,
2016 to September 30, 2016 are included in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the
line  Share of income in DSIT  under the equity method of accounting.  

The
Company currently does not have sufficient cash flow to finance its activities for the next 12 months. On July 12, 2016, the Company
and its GridSense subsidiary closed on a transaction for the sale of GridSense s assets (See Note 4). As a result of the
transaction, GridSense received gross proceeds of $1,000 of which $100 was set aside as an indemnity escrow. From the proceeds
of the sale, GridSense paid off approximately $240 of previously accrued severance and other payroll costs as well as approximately
$56 of transaction costs of the sale transaction. Following the sale, GridSense also engaged a third-party liquidation officer
to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining proceeds, the claims of GridSense creditors, including Acorn
which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through October 31, 2016, the liquidator has settled approximately $5,890 of GridSense
creditor claims ($5,555 from the Company), while disbursing approximately $535 to the creditors of GridSense ($500 to the Company).
As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $230 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.  

Additional
liquidity will be necessary to finance the operating activities of Acorn and the operations of its OmniMetrix subsidiary. The
Company will continue to pursue sources of funding, which may include loans from related and/or non-related parties, a sale or
partial sale of one or more of its businesses, finding a strategic partner or equity financings. There can be no assurance additional
funding will be available at terms acceptable to the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
utilize any of these possible sources to provide additional liquidity. If additional funding is not available in sufficient amounts,
Acorn will not be able to fund its own corporate activities during the next twelve months, which could materially impact its ability
to continue operations, and the Company may not be able to fund OmniMetrix as it has historically, which could materially impact
its carrying value. As such, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
2 RECENT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE   

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern,  outlining management s responsibility to
evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, along with the required
disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2014-15 on its financial
statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU
2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, by requiring them to be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as
interest expense. There is no change to the current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. For public
business entities, ASU 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification
and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities
measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with
early adoption permitted under certain circumstances.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01 on its
financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, lessees will
be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make
lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents
the lessee s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based
payments, including treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures, as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding
requirements. The ASU will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is evaluating the future
impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.  

Other
recently issued accounting updates are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
3 DSIT SOLUTIONS, LTD. ( DSIT )   

On
April 21, 2016 (the  Closing Date ), the Company closed on a transaction (the  DSIT Transaction ) initially
entered into on January 28, 2016 for the sale of a portion of its interests DSIT Solutions, Ltd. business to Rafael Advanced Defense
Systems Ltd., a major Israeli defense company. At closing, Acorn received gross proceeds of $4,913 before escrow, fees and taxes.
From the gross proceeds, the Company deposited approximately $579 to satisfy the escrow requirements in the sale. The Company
expects the escrow deposit to be released 18 months from the Closing Date. The Company also paid an Israeli withholding tax of
approximately $266 and incurred transaction costs of $184. In connection with the DSIT Transaction, the Company recorded a gain
of $3,543. The Company is also eligible to receive its 82.4% pro-rata share of a $1,000 earn-out over a three-year period if certain
operating results targets are met. The earn-out is not included in the determination of the gain in the DSIT Transaction and will
only be recorded as a gain if and when the parties agree that the earn-out has in fact been earned.  

Prior
to the Closing Date, all options in the DSIT Key Employee Stock Option Plan were exercised and DSIT received proceeds of $391,
and the Company s holdings in DSIT were reduced from 88.3% to 78.7%. As a result of the DSIT Transaction, the Company s
holdings in DSIT were reduced from 78.7% to 41.2%, and subsequent to the DSIT Transaction, the Company has limited representation
on the DSIT Board of directors. Accordingly, after the Closing Date, the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT.  

Assets
and liabilities related to the deconsolidated operations of DSIT are as follows:  

The
Due from Acorn balance at September 30, 2016 is comprised of a loan of $340 from DSIT and unreimbursed expenses of $476, both
of which accrue interest at 3.15% per annum. Such balances are due the earlier of December 31, 2017 or the sale of Acorn s
remaining shares in DSIT. In addition to the above balances, the Due from Acorn balance also includes $250 with respect to provisions
for severance and vacation for the Company s CFO who is an employee of DSIT.  

DSIT s
results that were included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the three and nine month
periods ending September 30, 2015 can be seen below:  

As
indicated above, after the Closing Date, the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT. After the Closing Date, the Company
accounts for its investment in DSIT under the equity method. The initial balance of the Company s investment in DSIT ($5,391)
was determined based on the fair value of its 41.2% holdings in DSIT following the DSIT Transaction and the $13,100 value attributed
to DSIT in the DSIT Transaction.  

DSIT s
results and the Company s share of its net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from
the Closing Date to September 30, 2016 can be seen below:  

NOTE
4  Discontinued Operations    

(a)
GridSense  

On
April 21, 2016, the Company announced that it decided to cease operations of its GridSense subsidiary and initiate the liquidation
of the GridSense assets. As a result of this decision, GridSense is being reported as a discontinued operation. Following the
decision to cease GridSense operations, the Company wrote down all GridSense assets to their estimated realizable values at the
time and accrued for estimated severance costs of $140 and lease commitments of $100 in GridSense s first quarter results.  

On
July 12, 2016, the Company and its GridSense subsidiary completed the sale of the GridSense assets to Franklin Fueling Systems,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. for a gross sales price of $1,000 of which $100 was set aside as
an indemnity escrow. If there are no indemnifiable claims against the indemnity escrow, $50 will be released to GridSense on January
7, 2017 and any balance shall be released on July 7, 2017.  

Following
the sale, GridSense paid off approximately $240 of previously accrued severance and other payroll costs. GridSense recorded a
gain of $944 (net of transaction costs) on this transaction as the value of the GridSense assets sold had previously been written
down to nearly zero. Such gain is included in discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2016.  

Following
the sale, GridSense also engaged a third-party liquidation officer to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining
proceeds, the claims of GridSense creditors, including Acorn which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through September 30,
2016, the third-party liquidator settled approximately $340 of outside creditor claims while disbursing approximately $33 to those
creditors.  

Assets
and liabilities related to the discontinued operations of GridSense are as follows:  

GridSense
had a working agreement with its bank to allow GridSense to borrow against 80% of certain accounts receivable balances up to $750
at an interest equal to 1.25% per month. At December 31, 2015, GridSense was utilizing approximately $138 of its accounts receivable
line. Such balance was repaid prior to the expiration of the accounts receivable line on July 16, 2016.  

GridSense s
operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 are included in  Income (loss) from discontinued
operations, net of income taxes  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Selected financial
information for GridSense s operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented below:  

(b)
US Seismic Systems Inc. ( USSI )  

In
early 2015, the Company s Board of Directors decided that it would no longer continue to fund USSI s activities following
the significant decline in oil prices which led to significantly reduced demand for USSI s products. At that time, USSI
effectively suspended operations and terminated substantially all employees.  

On
September 28, 2015, the Board of Directors of USSI approved a motion to file a voluntary petition for protection under Chapter
7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (a  Chapter 7 Bankruptcy ). Such filing was made on September 30, 2015. Under
a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, control of USSI no longer rests with the Company, but rather with a court-appointed trustee. Accordingly,
effective September 30, 2015, the Company no longer consolidated the assets, liabilities or operating results of USSI.  

USSI s
losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are included in  Loss from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Selected financial information for
USSI s operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is presented below:  

NOTE
5 RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES   

In
2013, OmniMetrix restructured its operations to better align expenses with revenues following a change in management. The restructuring
involved employee severance and termination benefits as well as a charge for a significant reduction in the utilization of its
leased facility in Buford and a write-down of a majority of the remaining book value of leasehold improvements associated with
the leased facility. At December 31, 2015, $204 of lease payments associated with the reduced utilization of leased facilities
remained unpaid. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, OmniMetrix paid $34 of this liability. The total remaining accrued
restructuring balance of $170 is expected to be paid in full by December 31, 2019 and is included in Other current liabilities
($46) and Other long-term liabilities ($124) in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

NOTE
6 INVENTORY, NET   

The
composition of inventory is as follows:  

At
both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company s inventory reserve was $22.  

Following
the closing of the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3), the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT, but rather reports its
investment in DSIT using the equity method. Accordingly, the Company no longer includes DSIT inventory on the Company s
condensed consolidated balance sheets. Balances at December 31, 2015 include $41 of raw materials and $189 of work-in-process
related to DSIT.  

NOTE
7 GOODWILL    

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in the Company s Energy   Security Sonar Solutions segment from December
31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was as follows:  

Following
the closing of the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3), the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT, but rather reports its
investment in DSIT using the equity method. Accordingly, the Company eliminated this goodwill as part of the deconsolidation of
DSIT.  

NOTE
8  FiNANCING    

(a)
Loans from Directors  

In
January 2016, the Company borrowed a total of $300 ($200 from one director and $100 from another director) under promissory notes
which were to mature three days following the receipt of proceeds from the closing of the DSIT Transaction. In March 2016, the
Company borrowed, on similar terms, an additional $75 from another director. Upon maturity, the Company was to pay to each director
a single payment equal to 115% of the amounts borrowed under the promissory notes. Under the terms of each promissory note, at
maturity, the lender could elect to convert the entire amount due under the promissory note into Common Stock of the Company at
a conversion price equal to the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
maturity date of the loan.  

On
April 29, 2016, following the receipt of the net proceeds from the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3), the Company repaid in full $275
($200 from one director and $75 from a another director) of the principal amount of the promissory notes plus interest equal to
15% of the amounts borrowed under the promissory notes.  

In
addition, a third director who had lent the Company $100, elected to convert the principal and the $15 of interest due into Common
Stock of the Company. In accordance with the terms of the promissory note, the director received 465,587 shares of Common Stock
of the Company.  

(b)
Short-term debt  

In
February 2016, the Company s OmniMetrix subsidiary signed a Loan and Security Agreement with a lender providing OmniMetrix
with access to accounts receivable formula-based financing of up to $500. In connection with this financing arrangement, OmniMetrix
granted the lender a security interest in OmniMetrix s receivables, inventory and certain other assets. Debt incurred under
this financing arrangement bears interest at the greater of prime (3.5% at September 30, 2016) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition,
OmniMetrix was to pay a monthly service charge of 1.125% of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month,
for a current effective rate of interest on advances of 19.5%. At the time, the Loan and Security Agreement reflected a $500 credit
line and the lender imposed a sublimit of $300 and had sole discretion as to when to remove the sublimit.  

In
September 2016, the abovementioned Loan and Security Agreement was amended to reflect a reduced monthly service charge of 1.0%
and modified formula determining the amount available from 80% of eligible hardware invoices and 40% of eligible monitoring invoices
to 75% of all eligible invoices. In return, OmniMetrix agreed to maintain a minimum loan balance of $150 in its line-of-credit
with the lender for a minimum of one year beginning October 1, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, OmniMetrix had an outstanding balance of approximately $47 pursuant to the amended Loan and Security Agreement.  

NOTE
9 CHANGE OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT   

(a)
Resignation of the Company s President and CEO  

Effective
January 28, 2016, the Company s President and CEO (John A. Moore) tendered his resignation to the Board. The Board determined
that such resignation was for  Good Reason  as such term is defined under Mr. Moore s Employment Agreement.
Accordingly, beginning on August 1, 2016 and continuing until on or about July 15, 2017, the Company will make aggregate severance
payments to Mr. Moore of $425. The Company is making such severance payments in accordance with its regular payroll practices.
In addition, the Company is reimbursing Mr. Moore up to an aggregate of $17 over the twelve-month period from February 2016 to
January 2017 for the costs associated with Mr. Moore s medical insurance. The above amounts were included in Selling, general
and administrative expenses in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated Statements of Operations in the first quarter
of 2016. In addition, in accordance with his Employment Agreement, all of Mr. Moore s unvested options become vested as
of the date of his resignation. At September 30, 2016, the remaining balance with respect to amounts due to Mr. Moore was $357
and is included in Accrued payroll, payroll taxes and social benefits on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.  

(b)
Appointment of new President and CEO  

Effective
January 28, 2016, Acorn engaged Jan H. Loeb to be the Company s President and CEO under a consulting agreement (the  Consulting
Agreement ) with a company (the  Consultant ) managed by Mr. Loeb. Under the Consulting Agreement, the Consultant
is to be paid a monthly fee of $17 for the term of the Consulting Agreement (through January 7, 2017). Pursuant to the Consulting
Agreement, on March 16, 2016, Acorn issued to the Consultant, for nominal consideration, warrants exercisable for 35,000 shares
of Acorn common stock. The exercise price of the warrants is $0.13 per share. One-fourth of the warrants were immediately exercisable
with the remainder becoming exercisable in equal increments on each of June 16, 2016, September 16, 2016 and December 16, 2016.
The warrants expire on the earlier of (a) March 16, 2023 and (b) 18 months from the date Mr. Loeb ceases to be a director, officer,
employee or consultant of Acorn.

  Leap Tide Capital Partners III  

On
August 13, 2015, the Company executed a Loan and Security Agreement with Leap Tide Capital Partners III, LLC ( Leap Tide ),
pursuant to which the Company borrowed $2,000 from Leap Tide (the  LT Loan ). Jan H. Loeb, the Company s new
President and CEO (see Note 9(b)) is the Manager of Leap Tide. Principal and accrued interest was due and payable on August 13,
2016. Interest accrued and was payable quarterly at a rate of 10% per annum. On April 29, 2016, following the receipt of the net
proceeds from the DSIT Transaction, the Company repaid in full the $2,000 of principal and all accrued interest in full satisfaction
of the cash due to Leap Tide under the LT Loan.  

In
addition to the interest payable in cash described above, Leap Tide received 850,000 shares of the Company s common stock
(the  Initial Shares ) at the closing and was entitled to vested rights to receive 179,167 additional shares of the
Company s common stock (each vested right to receive one share, a  Vested Share Right ) per month for each full
month that the full principal amount of the LT Loan was outstanding. The number of Vested Share Rights that accrued in a given
month was prorated to the extent less than the full principal amount was outstanding and/or for any partial month in which no
principal amount was outstanding. Through April 29, 2016, the date of repayment, Leap Tide earned 1,531,396 Vested Share Rights.  

Under
the terms of the LT Loan, the Company had the right on or prior to 30 days after the repayment of the LT Loan (the  Cash
Settlement Period ) to repurchase any or all Initial Shares and settle any or all Vested Share Rights accrued under the
LT Loan for cash in lieu of stock. The cash repurchase/settlement price would have been $0.30 for each Initial Share so repurchased
and each Vested Share Right so settled. The Company did not repurchase any of the Initial Shares or settle any of the accrued
Vested Share Rights for cash and all 1,531,396 Vested Share Rights were converted into 1,531,396 shares of Common Stock of the
Company after the expiration of the Cash Settlement Period.

Financial
items measured at fair value are classified in the table below in accordance with the hierarchy established in applicable accounting
principles.  

Escrow
deposits relate to escrow requirements from the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3).  

Restricted
deposits (both current and non-current) and derivative liabilities at December 31, 2015 were all related to DSIT. Following the
closing of the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3), the Company no longer consolidates the results of DSIT, but rather reports its investment
in DSIT using the equity method. Accordingly, the Company eliminated these financial items as part of the deconsolidation of DSIT.  

Level

prices were readily available. Unrealized gains or losses from forward contracts are recorded in Finance income (expense), net.  

See
Note 3 for the determination of the fair value of the Company s equity investment in DSIT.   

NOTE
12 SEGMENT REPORTING   

The
Company currently operates in two reportable operating segments, both of which are performed though the Company s OmniMetrix
subsidiary:  

Power
    Generation ( PG ) monitoring (formerly known as Machine-to-Machine Critical Asset Monitoring   Control). The
    PG segment provides wireless remote monitoring and control systems and services for critical assets as well as Internet of
    Things applications.   

Corrosion
    Protection ( CP ) monitoring. The CP segment provides for remote monitoring of cathodic protection systems on
    gas pipelines for gas utilities and pipeline companies.   

In
addition, up to the closing of the DSIT Transaction (see Note 3), the Company reported its activities in the Energy   Security
Sonar Solutions segment. This segment, whose activities were performed by DSIT, provides sonar and acoustic related solutions
for energy, defense and commercial markets with a focus on underwater site security for strategic energy installations and other
advanced acoustic systems and real-time embedded hardware and software development and production.  Other  operations
include certain IT activities (protocol management software for cancer patients and billing software) and outsourced consulting
activities performed by the Company s DSIT subsidiary that did not meet the quantitative thresholds under applicable accounting
principles.  

Following
the closing of the DSIT Transaction, the Company is no longer consolidating the results of DSIT, but rather is reporting on its
investment in DSIT on the equity method. Accordingly, effective April 22, 2016, the Company no longer consolidates the results
of DSIT s Energy   Security Sonar Solutions segment or the activities of its  Other  segment.  

Previously,
the Company reported GridSense s activities in its Smart Grid Distribution Automation segment which developed and produced
fiber optic sensing systems for the energy and security markets. With the suspension of operations at GridSense (see Note 4(a)),
its activities are reflected as discontinued operations.

RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS   

On
July 12, 2016, we closed on a transaction for the sale of GridSense s assets. As a result of the transaction, GridSense
received gross proceeds of $1.0 million of which $100,000 was set aside as an indemnity escrow. Following the sale, GridSense
paid off approximately $240,000 of previously accrued severance and other payroll costs. Subsequently, GridSense engaged a third-party
liquidation officer to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining proceeds, the claims of GridSense creditors,
including Acorn which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through October 31, 2016, the liquidator has settled approximately
$5.9 million of GridSense creditor claims ($5.6 million from Acorn), while disbursing approximately $535,000 to the creditors
of GridSense ($500,000 to Acorn). At October 31, 2016, GridSense had approximately $24,000 of cash available (excluding escrow
amounts) for satisfaction of remaining creditor claims. Acorn cannot determine with certainty the amount, if any, of these remaining
proceeds that may be available to it.  

OVERVIEW
AND TREND INFORMATION   

Acorn
Energy, Inc. ( Acorn  or  the Company ) is a holding company focused on technology driven solutions for
energy infrastructure asset management. Each of our two businesses (OmniMetrix and DSIT) is focused on helping its customers achieve
greater productivity, reliability, security and efficiency.  

We
currently operate in two reportable operating segments, both of which are performed though our OmniMetrix subsidiary:  

Power
    Generation ( PG )  monitoring (formerly known as Machine-to-Machine Critical Asset Monitoring   Control).
    The PG segment provides wireless remote monitoring and control systems and services for critical assets as well as Internet
    of Things applications.    

Corrosion
    Protection ( CP )  monitoring. The CP segment provides for remote monitoring of cathodic protection systems
    on gas pipelines for gas utilities and pipeline companies.   

In
addition, up to the closing of the DSIT Transaction on April 21, 2016 (the  Closing Date ), we reported most of DSIT s
activities in our Energy   Security Sonar Solutions segment. This segment, whose activities were performed by DSIT, provides
sonar and acoustic related solutions for energy, defense and commercial markets with a focus on underwater site security for strategic
energy installations and other advanced acoustic systems and real-time embedded hardware and software development and production.
 Other  operations include certain IT activities (protocol management software for cancer patients and billing software)
and outsourced consulting activities also performed by DSIT that did not meet the quantitative thresholds under applicable accounting
principles.  

Following
the closing of the DSIT Transaction, we are no longer consolidating the results of DSIT, but rather are reporting on our investment
in DSIT on the equity method. Accordingly, effective April 22, 2016, we no longer consolidate the results DSIT s activities
that were included in the Energy   Security Sonar Solutions or  Other  segment.  

Previously,
we reported GridSense s activities in its Smart Grid Distribution Automation segment which developed, marketed and sold
remote monitoring and control systems to electric utilities and industrial facilities worldwide. With the suspension of operations
at GridSense, its activities are reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidation statements of operations.  

The
following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in Note 12 to the interim unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report.  

OmniMetrix   

Following
the emergence of machine-to-machine and Internet of Things applications whereby companies aggregate multiple sensors and monitors
into a simplified dashboard for customers, OmniMetrix believes it can play a key role in this new economic ecosystem. In addition,
OmniMetrix sees a rapidly growing need for backup power infrastructure to secure critical military and government assets against
emergency events including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and cybersecurity threats. As residential and industrial standby
generators as well as turbines, compressors, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers and other industrial equipment that are part of the
critical infrastructure increasingly becoming monitored in Internet of Things applications, and given that OmniMetrix monitors
all major brands of critical equipment, OmniMetrix believes it is well-positioned to be a competitive participant in this new
market.  

OmniMetrix
has two divisions: Power Generation ( PG ) and Corrosion Protection ( CP ). In the first nine months of
2016, OmniMetrix recorded revenue of $2,544,000 ($2,057,000 in its PG activities and $487,000 in its CP activities) as compared
to $2,150,000 ($1,774,000 in its PG activities and $376,000 in its CP activities) recorded in the first nine months of 2015, representing
an increase of 18%. Increased revenue in 2016 was driven by hardware revenue which increased from $690,000 in 2015 to $1,182,000
in 2016. The increase in hardware revenue was partially offset by a decrease in monitoring revenue which dropped from $1,459,000
in 2015 to $1,362,000 in 2016. The decrease is the result of a one-time adjustment of $130,000 made in the second quarter of 2016
with respect to a previous understatement of deferred revenue. Third quarter 2016 revenue increased 20% to $942,000 from $786,000
in the third quarter of 2015.  

First
nine months 2016 gross profit of $1,306,000 reflected a gross margin of 51% on 2016 revenue. Such gross profit represents a slight
increase (4%) from first nine months 2015 gross profit of $1,251,000 (gross margin of 58%). The increase in gross profit was tempered
by the aforementioned one-time second quarter adjustment which decreased monitoring revenue by $130,000. Without such adjustment,
first nine months 2016 gross profit would have increased by $185,000 (15%) and gross margin would have been 54% - as compared
to the 58% gross margin in 2015. The decrease in the normalized gross margin is the result of increased residential generator
monitoring as residential generator monitoring margins are slightly lower than that of commercial and industrial generator monitoring.
OmniMetrix continues to maintain its high margin (in excess of 80%) on its recurring monitoring revenue stream.  

During
the first nine months of 2016, OmniMetrix recorded $322,000 of R D expense as compared to approximately $415,000 of R D
expense in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease the R D expense was attributable to staff changes and product certification
costs incurred in 2015. We expect R D costs to approximate their current levels as we continue to work on certain initiatives
to redesign certain products to reduce their costs in order to increase our future margins.  

During
the first nine months of 2016, OmniMetrix recorded approximately $1,937,000 of SG A expense. Such expense was $159,000 or
8% below the first nine months 2015 SG A expense of $2,096,000. The decrease in SG A expense was due to the decreased
salary costs associated with changes in OmniMetrix personnel. Third quarter SG A expense of $650,000 reflected a decrease
from second quarter 2016 SG A costs of $691,000. The decreased costs from the second quarter of 2016 were the result of recruiting
fees and consulting fees incurred in the second quarter of 2016. We anticipate that SG A costs will remain relatively stable
in upcoming quarters.  

In
February 2016, OmniMetrix signed a Loan and Security Agreement with a lender providing OmniMetrix with access to accounts receivable
formula-based financing of up to $500,000. In connection with this financing arrangement, OmniMetrix granted the lender a security
interest in OmniMetrix s receivables, inventory and certain other assets. Debt incurred under this financing arrangement
bears interest at the greater of prime (3.5% at December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition, OmniMetrix
was to pay a monthly service charge of 1.125% of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month, for a
current effective rate of interest on advances of 19.5%. At the time, the Loan and Security Agreement reflected a $500,000 credit
line and the lender imposed a sublimit of $300,000 and had sole discretion as to when to remove the sublimit.  

In
September 2016, the abovementioned Loan and Security Agreement was amended to reflect a reduced monthly service charge of 1.0%
and modified formula determining the amount available from 80% of eligible hardware invoices and 40% of eligible monitoring invoices
to 75% of all eligible invoices. In return, OmniMetrix agreed to maintain a minimum loan balance of $150,000 in its line-of-credit
with the lender for a minimum of one year beginning October 1, 2016.  

As
of November 9, 2016, OmniMetrix had an outstanding balance of approximately $240,000 pursuant to the amended Loan and Security
Agreement.  

We
have no assurance that OmniMetrix s credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for all of OmniMetrix s working
capital needs in 2016 and beyond. Additional financing for OmniMetrix may be in the form of a bank line, new investment by others,
a loan by Acorn, or a combination of the above. The availability and amount of any additional loans from us to OmniMetrix may
be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities.  

DSIT
Solutions   

On
April 21, 2016, we closed on the sale of nearly 50% of our interest in our DSIT Solutions, Ltd. business to Rafael Advanced Defense
Systems Ltd. As DSIT has grown, we came to recognize the value of it having a strong strategic partner with the size, resources
and scope of Rafael s capabilities. We believe this partnership will accelerate DSIT s growth by leveraging Rafael s
technological capabilities and reputation as well as its impressive global sales reach in support of DSIT s industry-leading
sonar technology and its fiber-optic based sensing solutions. We believe that DSIT s global reach and sales potential is
significantly enhanced through our partnership with Rafael. Following the closing of the DSIT Transaction, we no longer consolidate
the results of DSIT, but rather are reporting on our investment in DSIT on the equity method.  

In
June, DSIT announced that it received a new $7.1 million order for its Blackfish Hull Mounted Sonar (HMS) systems to be delivered
over a two-year period. The Blackfish is an advanced, medium-frequency Hull Mounted Sonar designed for littoral (near shore) as
well as deep water Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operations.  

DSIT
revenue of $11.9 million in the first nine months of 2016 ($5.1 million through the closing of the DSIT Transaction) was $1.8
million or 18% above its revenue for the first nine months of 2015 ($10.1 million). Third quarter 2016 revenue ($4.0 million)
increased 11% ($0.4 million) over third quarter 2015 revenue and slightly (approximately $60,000 or 1%) as compared to second
quarter 2016 revenue. Gross profit and operating income both improved for DSIT in 2016.  

The
increase in DSIT s revenue was due to revenue recorded with respect to DSIT s $15.4 million project received in the
first quarter of 2015 for Hull Mounted Sonar (HMS) systems and an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Trainer for an unnamed navy as
well as increases in revenue from DSIT s non-Naval projects.  

DSIT s
gross profit increased 4% from $3.5 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2016.
Gross profit increased as a result of increased revenue as gross margin decreased from 35% in 2016 to 31% in 2016. Gross margin
in the third quarter of 2016 was 28% as compared to 33% in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in the gross margin in 2016
is attributable to the near completion of a major high margin project in 2016 with newer projects coming in at lower margins.  

During
the first nine months of 2016, DSIT recorded $810,000 of net R D expense. Such net R D expense was virtually unchanged
from the $809,000 of R D expense recorded in the first nine months of 2015.  

During
the first nine months of 2016, DSIT recorded $2.5 million of SG A expense, 5% above the $2.3 million recorded in the first
nine months of 2015. The increase from the first nine months of 2015 was due to certain one-time costs associated with the sale
to Rafael.  

At
December 31, 2015, DSIT had a backlog of approximately $20.6 million. During the first nine months of 2016, DSIT received new
orders totaling approximately $13.1 million, and at the end of September 2016 had a backlog of approximately $21.8 million.  

DSIT
net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $217,000 of which $156,000 was recorded during the period from the closing of
the DSIT Transaction to September 30, 2016. As noted above, we no longer consolidate the results of DSIT. After the closing of
the DSIT Transaction, we account for our investment in DSIT under the equity method. The initial balance of our investment in
DSIT (approximately $5.4 million) was determined based on our 41.2% holding in DSIT post-closing and the $13.1 million value attributed
to DSIT in the DSIT Transaction. In the period following the Closing Date, we recorded $63,000 as our 41.2% share of DSIT s
net income for the period from the Closing Date to September 30, 2016 ($38,000 in the third quarter of 2016).  

GridSense   

On
April 21, 2016, we announced our decision to cease operations of our GridSense subsidiary and initiate the liquidation of the
GridSense assets. As a result of this decision, GridSense is being reported as a discontinued operation effective with our first
quarter 2016 report.  

On
July 12, 2016, Acorn Energy, Inc. and GridSense sold the GridSense assets to Franklin Fueling Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. for a gross sales price of $1.0 million of which $100,000 was set aside as an indemnity escrow.
If there are no indemnifiable claims against the indemnity escrow, $50,000 will be released to GridSense on January 7, 2017 and
any balance shall be released on July 7, 2017.  

Following
the sale, GridSense paid off approximately $240,000 of previously accrued severance and other payroll costs. GridSense recorded
a gain of $944,000 (net of transaction costs) on this transaction as the value of the GridSense assets sold had previously been
written down to nearly zero. Such gain is included in discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2016.  

Subsequently,
GridSense engaged a third-party liquidation officer to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining proceeds,
the claims of GridSense creditors, including Acorn which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through October 31, 2016, the
liquidator has settled approximately $5.9 million of GridSense creditor claims ($5.6 million from Acorn), while disbursing approximately
$535,000 to the creditors of GridSense ($500,000 to Acorn). At October 31, 2016, GridSense had approximately $24,000 of cash available
(excluding escrow amounts) for satisfaction of remaining creditor claims. Acorn cannot determine with certainty the amount, if
any, of these remaining proceeds that may be available to it.  

Corporate   

Corporate
general and administrative expense of $1,845,000 in the first nine months of 2016 reflected a decrease of $955,000 or 34% from
the $2,800,000 of expense reported in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expense
was due to decreased professional fees and investor relations expense as well as decreased board costs and non-cash stock compensation
expense following a restructure of the composition of compensation made to Board members. These decreases were partially offset
by the $460,000 of severance and related costs and $174,000 of non-cash stock compensation expense associated with the acceleration
of the vesting of Mr. Moore s options following the resignation of John A. Moore, our former CEO. Excluding these one-time
charges, corporate general and administrative expense would have decreased by $1,579,000 or 56%.  

Third
quarter G A expense of $365,000 was $57,000 (19%) greater than second quarter 2016 G A expense of $308,000 and $547,000
(60%) below third quarter 2015 G A expense. The increase in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of
2016 was due to the timing of certain professional and consulting fees. The decrease as compared to the third quarter of 2015
was due to reduced professional fees and salaries as well as a result of the significant cuts we made in our directors 
fees in the first quarter of 2016. We believe corporate general and administrative quarterly expense for the remainder of 2016
and into 2017 to approximate our third quarter 2016 expense, depending upon the level of professional fees incurred. We continue
to seek ways to further reduce our operating expenses going forward.  

In
April 2016, we closed on the sale of nearly 50% of our interest in our DSIT Solutions, Ltd. business to Rafael Advanced Defense
Systems Ltd., a major Israeli defense company. At closing, we received gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 million before escrow,
fees and taxes. From the gross proceeds, we deposited approximately $579,000 to satisfy the escrow requirements in the sale. We
expect to be able access those funds, net of any disbursements, in October 2017. We also paid an Israeli withholding tax of approximately
$266,000 and incurred transaction costs of approximately $184,000. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain of approximately
$2.6 million in the second quarter. We are also eligible to receive our pro-rata share (approximately 82.4%) of a $1.0 million
earn-out over a three-year period. Following the sale, we own approximately 41.2% of DSIT with DSIT management owning approximately
8.8% and Rafael owning 50%. As we no longer consolidate the results of DSIT following the closing of the DSIT Transaction, we
recorded a gain in the second quarter of approximately $1.0 million upon deconsolidating DSIT from our consolidated balance sheet.  

Following
the receipt of the net proceeds from the DSIT Transaction, we repaid in full the $2.0 million of principal and approximately $15,000
of accrued interest in full satisfaction of the cash due under the Loan and Security Agreement with Leap Tide Capital Partners
III, LLC ( Leap Tide ). In addition, following the receipt of the net proceeds from the DSIT Transaction, we repaid
in full $275,000 of loans from directors ($200,000 from one director and $75,000 from a another director) under promissory notes
plus interest equal to 15% of the amounts borrowed under the promissory notes. Remaining proceeds from the DSIT Transaction were
used for corporate expenses and financing the operations of OmniMetrix.  

Following
the sale of the GridSense assets to Franklin Fueling Systems, Inc. (see above), GridSense engaged an third-party liquidation officer
to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining proceeds, the claims of GridSense creditors, including Acorn
which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through October 31, 2016, the third-party liquidator settled outside creditor claims
while disbursing approximately $35,000 to those creditors as well as $500,000 to Acorn in partial satisfaction of Acorn s
claims against GridSense. At October 31, 2016, GridSense had approximately $24,000 of cash available (excluding escrow amounts)
for satisfaction of remaining creditor claims. Acorn cannot determine with certainty the amount, if any, of these remaining proceeds
that may be available to it.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following table sets forth certain information with respect to the consolidated results of operations of the Company for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, including the percentage of total revenues during each period attributable
to selected components of the operations statement data and for the period to period percentage changes in such components. For
segment data see Note 12 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.  

Revenue.
 Revenue in the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $4,599,000, or 38%, to $7,618,000 from $12,217,000 in the first nine
months of 2015. The decrease in revenue was due to the fact that we are no longer consolidating the results of DSIT following
the DSIT Transaction. OmniMetrix reported an increase in revenue of 18% from $2,150,000 for the first nine months of 2015 to $2,544,000
for the first nine months of 2016. OmniMetrix s increased revenue was attributable to an increase in the number of units
being monitored. DSIT reported $11.9 million of revenue in the first nine months of 2016 (as compared to $10.1 million of revenue
in the first nine months of 2015), of which $5.1 million was reported in the period up to the DSIT Transaction.  

Gross
profit.  Gross profit in the first nine months of 2016 reflected a decrease of $1,797,000 (38%) as compared to the first nine
months of 2015. The decrease in gross profit was due to the fact that we are no longer consolidating the results of DSIT following
the DSIT Transaction. OmniMetrix recorded gross profit of $1,306,000 in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a $1,251,000
gross profit recorded in the first nine months of 2015. OmniMetrix s gross margin decreased from 58% in the first nine months
of 2015 to 51% in the first nine months 2016. The decreased gross margin was due to a one-time monitoring revenue adjustment of
$130,000 made in the second quarter of 2016 with respect to a previous understatement of deferred monitoring revenue combined
with increased residential generator monitoring as residential generator monitoring margins are slightly lower than that of commercial
and industrial generator monitoring . DSIT reported $3.6 million of gross profit in the first nine months of 2016 (as compared
to $3.5 million of gross profit in the first nine months of 2015), of which $1.6 million was reported in the period up to the
DSIT Transaction.  

Research
and development ( R D ) expenses.  R D expenses decreased $434,000 (35%) to $791,000 in the first nine
months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in R D expenses was due to the fact that we are
no longer consolidating the results of DSIT following the DSIT Transaction. DSIT reported $469,000 of R D expenses in the
2016 period up to the DSIT Transaction as compared to $810,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. OmniMetrix R D
expense decreased in the first nine months of 2016 to $322,000 from $415,000 in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease at
OmniMetrix was attributable to staff changes and certain one-time costs incurred in 2015.  

Selling,
general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses.  SG A expenses in the first nine months of 2016 decreased
by $2,397,000 or 33% as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Corporate general and administrative expense decreased 34%
from $2,800,000 in the first nine months of 2015 to $1,845,000 in the first nine months of 2016. The decrease in corporate general
and administrative expense was due to decreased professional fees and investor relations expense as well as decreased board costs
and non-cash stock compensation expense following a restructure of the composition of compensation made to Board members. These
decreases were partially offset by the severance and related costs associated with the resignation of John A. Moore, our former
CEO. Both OmniMetrix and DSIT also reported decreased SG A expense in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first
nine months of 2015. The decrease in DSIT s reported SG A expense was due to the fact that we are no longer consolidating
the results of DSIT s following the DSIT Transaction. OmniMetrix recorded a modest decrease (8%) in SG A expense from
$2,096,000 in the first nine months of 2015 to $1,937,000 in the first nine months of 2016. The decrease in SG A expense at
OmniMetrix was due to changes in personnel.  

Finance
expense, net.  Finance expense in 2016 is primarily comprised of interest expense of $446,000 ($381,000 of which was non-cash
interest related to the accretion of discount and the value of shares given in the borrowing) recorded in connection with our
borrowings from Leap Tide Capital Partners III, and $56,000 of interest to directors of Acorn as a result of their loans to us
in early 2016.  

Sale
of DSIT.  In April 2016, we closed on the sale of nearly 50% of our interest in our DSIT Solutions, Ltd. Business. As a result
of the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.6 million, a gain on the deconsolidation of DSIT of approximately $1.0 million
and our share in the income of DSIT following the close of the transaction of approximately $63,000.  

Loss
from discontinued operations, net of income taxes.  During the first nine months of 2016, GridSense recorded losses net of
income tax of $455,000. During the first nine months of 2015, GridSense recorded losses net of income tax of $3,478,000 while
USSI recorded a loss of $1,173,000.  

Net
loss attributable to Acorn Energy.  We had net income attributable to Acorn Energy of $0.1 million in the first nine months
of 2016 compared to a net loss of $8.7 million in the first nine months of 2015. Our net income in 2016 is comprised of losses
of $0.5 million at GridSense which is included in discontinued operations, corporate expenses of $2.3 million and a loss at OmniMetrix
of nearly $1.0 million. These losses were offset by the gains we reported on the sale of a portion of our interests in DSIT ($3.6
million) and $205,000 of non-controlling interests share in our losses. Corporate expenses include approximately $460,000 of severance
and related costs plus an additional $174,000 of non-cash stock compensation associated with resignation of our former CEO. Corporate
expenses also include approximately $0.5 million of interest expense associated with our borrowings from Leap Tide and our directors.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016 we had negative working capital of $2.7 million (negative $2.0 million in our continuing operations). Our
negative working capital includes $104,000 of cash and cash equivalents as well as $2.0 million of deferred revenue in OmniMetrix.
Such deferred revenue does not require significant cash outlay in order for the revenue to be recognized. Net cash decreased during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by $20,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $3.9 million of cash was
used in operating activities ($3.0 million in continuing operations).  

Our
corporate headquarters used approximately $1.3 million during the first nine months of 2016 while our OmniMetrix subsidiary used
$0.5 million of cash for its operations during the first nine months of 2016. DSIT used approximately $1.2 million in its operations
during 2016 up through the date of the DSIT Transaction. Our discontinued operations (GridSense) used $0.9 million in their operating
activities in the first nine months of 2016.  

Cash
provided by investing activities of $5.0 million was primarily due to the $3.4 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion
of our interests in DSIT (net of transaction costs, DSIT cash and amounts set aside for escrow) and $0.8 million from net release
of cash in restricted deposits at DSIT prior to our sale. In addition, our discontinued GridSense operations generated $0.9 million
of cash from the $1.0 million of proceeds from the sale of its assets less $100,000 that was set aside as an indemnity escrow.  

Net
cash of $0.9 million was used in financing activities in continuing operations during the first nine months of 2016. During 2016,
we repaid the $2.0 million we had borrowed from Leap Tide and $275,000 of director loans. These uses of cash were offset by borrowings
from directors of $375,000 and $827,000 of cash provided from short-term credit facilities. Approximately $780,000 of the cash
provided from short-term credit facilities was from DSIT prior to the closing of the DSIT Transaction. DSIT also received $391,000
of proceeds from the exercise of options prior to the closing of the DSIT Transaction. In addition, our discontinued operations
at GridSense paid off their remaining short-term borrowings of $138,000.  

In
February 2016, OmniMetrix signed a Loan and Security Agreement with a lender providing OmniMetrix with access to accounts receivable
formula-based financing of up to $500,000. In connection with this financing arrangement, OmniMetrix granted the lender a security
interest in OmniMetrix s receivables, inventory and certain other assets. Debt incurred under this financing arrangement
bears interest at the greater of prime (3.5% at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition,
OmniMetrix was to pay a monthly service charge of 1.125% of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month,
for a current effective rate of interest on advances of 19.5%. At the time, the Loan and Security Agreement reflected a $500,000
credit line and the lender imposed a sublimit of $300,000 and had sole discretion as to when to remove the sublimit.  

In
September 2016, the abovementioned Loan and Security Agreement was amended to reflect a reduced monthly service charge of 1.0%
and modified formula determining the amount available from 80% of eligible hardware invoices and 40% of eligible monitoring invoices
to 75% of all eligible invoices. In return, OmniMetrix agreed to maintain a minimum loan balance of $150,000 in its line-of-credit
with the lender for a minimum of one year beginning October 1, 2016.  

As
of November 9, 2016, OmniMetrix had an outstanding balance of approximately $240,000 pursuant to the amended Loan and Security
Agreement.  

In
October, 2015, one Acorn s directors acquired a 10% interest in Acorn s OmniMetrix Holdings, Inc. subsidiary ( Holdings )
through the purchase of preferred stock (the  OmniMetrix Preferred Stock ) for $500,000. Holdings is the holder of
100% of the membership interests OmniMetrix, LLC. Subsequently, in November, 2015, the director acquired an additional 10% interest
in Holdings through the purchase of additional OmniMetrix Preferred Stock for an additional $500,000 and currently owns a 20%
interest in Holdings.  

A
dividend of 10% per annum accrues on the OmniMetrix Preferred Stock. A dividend was payable on the first anniversary of the funding
of the investment and quarterly thereafter for so long as the OmniMetrix Preferred Stock is outstanding and has not been converted
to Common Stock. The dividend is payable in cash or the form of additional shares of OmniMetrix Preferred Stock at the election
of the holder of the Preferred Stock.  

During
the period from time the Acorn director acquired OmniMetrix Preferred Stock through October 31, 2016, Acorn lent OmniMetrix $894,000
($790,000 in 2016). Acorn is in discussions with the director to offset the dividend payment due in October 2016 against his pro-rata
portion of loans not provided to OmniMetrix.  

We
have no assurance that OmniMetrix s credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for all of OmniMetrix s working
capital needs in 2016 and beyond. Additional financing for OmniMetrix may be in the form of a bank line, new investment by others,
a loan by Acorn, or a combination of the above. The availability and amount of any additional loans from us to OmniMetrix may
be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that
we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. However, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient
cash flow from our operations to satisfy our liabilities on a timely basis and to obtain additional funding or generate sufficient
revenue to cover our operating expenses. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

On
April 21, 2016, we announced our decision to cease operations of our GridSense subsidiary and initiate the liquidation of the
GridSense assets. As a result of this decision, GridSense is being reported as a discontinued operation. On July 12, 2016, Acorn
Energy, Inc. and GridSense sold the GridSense assets to Franklin Fueling Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin
Electric Co., Inc. for a gross sales price of $1.0 million of which $100,000 was set aside as an indemnity escrow. If there are
no indemnifiable claims against the indemnity escrow, $50,000 will be released to GridSense on January 7, 2017 and any balance
shall be released on July 7, 2017.  

Following
the sale, GridSense paid off approximately $240,000 of previously accrued severance and other payroll costs. Subsequently, GridSense
engaged a third-party liquidation officer to satisfy, to the extent of the funds available from the remaining proceeds, the claims
of GridSense creditors, including Acorn which is GridSense s largest creditor. Through October 31, 2016, the liquidator
has settled approximately $5.9 million of GridSense creditor claims, while disbursing approximately $535,000 to the creditors
of GridSense. At October 31, 2016, GridSense had approximately $24,000 of cash available (excluding escrow amounts) for satisfaction
of remaining creditor claims. Acorn cannot determine with certainty the amount, if any, of these remaining proceeds that may be
available to it.  

We
currently do not have sufficient cash flow for the next twelve months. On September 30, 2016, we had approximately $40,000 of
non-escrow corporate cash and cash equivalents and approximately $230,000 on October 31, 2016 following the $300,000 of cash transfers
from GridSense in October 2016.  

Additional
liquidity will be necessary to finance the operating activities of Acorn and the operations of our OmniMetrix subsidiary, and
we will continue to pursue sources of funding, which may include loans from related and/or non-related parties, a sale or partial
sale of one or more of our businesses, finding a strategic partner or equity financings. There can be no assurance additional
funding will be available at terms acceptable to us or that we will be able to successfully utilize any of these possible sources
to provide additional liquidity. If additional funding is not available in sufficient amounts, we will not be able to fund our
corporate activities during the next twelve months, which could materially impact our ability to continue operations, and we may
not be able to fund OmniMetrix as we have historically, which could materially impact its carrying value. As such, these factors
raise substantial doubt as to Acorn s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments   

The
table below provides information concerning our contractual obligations under certain categories as of September 30, 2016.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject Acorn to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
escrow deposits, and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents together with GridSense s cash and cash equivalents
and escrow deposit and are deposited primarily with U.S. financial institutions and amounted to approximately $600,000 at September
30, 2016. We use major banks and brokerage firms to invest our cash and cash equivalents, primarily in money market funds. Our
escrow deposit ($579,000) is held in an Israeli bank. Approximately 11% of the accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 was due
from one customer who pay their receivables over usual credit periods. Credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables
is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values
due to the short maturity of such investments.  

Interest
Rate Risk   

In
February 2016, OmniMetrix signed a Loan and Security Agreement with a lender providing OmniMetrix with access to accounts receivable
formula-based financing. Debt incurred under this financing arrangement bears interest at the greater of prime (3.5% at December
31, 2015 and at September 30, 2016) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition, OmniMetrix must pay a monthly service charge of 1.0%
of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month under the amended Loan and Security Agreement (see below).
As of September 30, 2016, OmniMetrix had an outstanding balance of approximately $47,000 under the Loan and Security Agreement.
Effective October 1, 2016, under the amended Loan and Security Agreement, OmniMetrix agreed to maintain an outstanding minimum
average balance of $150,000 and as of November 9, 2016, had an outstanding balance of approximately $240,000 under the amended
Loan and Security Agreement.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses noted in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms.  

As
noted in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we employ a decentralized internal control methodology,
coupled with management s oversight, whereby each subsidiary is responsible for mitigating its risks to financial reporting
by implementing and maintaining effective control policies and procedures and subsequently translating that respective risk mitigation
up and through to the parent level and to our external financial statements. In addition, as our subsidiaries are not large enough
to effectively mitigate certain risks by segregating incompatible duties, management must employ compensating mechanisms throughout
our company in a manner that is feasible within the constraints under which it operates.  

The
material weaknesses management identified were caused by an insufficient complement of resources at our subsidiaries, including
employee turnover and limited IT system capabilities, such that individual control policies and procedures at certain subsidiaries
could not be implemented, maintained, or remediated when and where necessary. As a result, a majority of the significant process
areas management identified for our OmniMetrix and GridSense subsidiaries had one or more material weaknesses present.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful, and Seller, at its
expense, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as possible. If any such consent

designed to provide such benefits to Buyer. Notwithstanding any provision in this  Section 2.07  to the contrary, Buyer shall
not be deemed to have waived its rights to the receipt of all required consents listed in the Disclosure Schedule unless and until

(a) Seller
shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification under  Section 7.02(a)  until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under  Section 7.02(a)  exceeds $25,000 (the   Basket  ), in which

(d) Payments
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.02 or Section 7.03 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any

payment actually received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim, less any related costs and expenses, including
the aggregate cost of pursuing any related insurance claims and any related increases in insurance premiums or other chargebacks
(it being agreed that neither party shall have any obligation to seek to recover any insurance proceeds prior to making a claim
under this Article VIII and that, promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such reduction in Losses for which the Indemnified Party
was indemnified prior to the realization of reduction of such Losses).  

(e) Each
Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware
of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only
to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.  

Section
7.05 Indemnification Procedures.   
The party making a claim under this  Article VII  is referred to as the   Indemnified Party  , and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this  Article VII  is referred to as the   Indemnifying Party  .

(a) Third
Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a   Third
Party Claim  ) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty calendar days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or is prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party s expense and by the Indemnifying Party s
own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense;  provided, that  such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to  Section 7.05(b) , it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it
subject to the Indemnifying Party s right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party,  provided, that  if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party,
(A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party,
unless the Third Party Claim is litigated in multiple jurisdictions, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of local counsel in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines such
counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to  Section 7.05(b) , pay, compromise, defend such
Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including making available records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement
of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.  

(b) Settlement
of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement
of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this  Section 7.05(b) .
If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation
on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and
agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten business days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to
such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such
firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to  Section 7.05(a) , it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  

(c) Direct
Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a   Direct
Claim  ) shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
but in any event not later than thirty days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or is otherwise prejudiced thereby.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate
the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party s investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to the Indemnified Party s premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such thirty-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.  

Section
7.06 Payments.    Once a Loss
is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this  Article VII , the Indemnifying
Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen Business Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; or to the extent of the Escrow Amount, through written authorization by the Seller to the Escrow
Agent to disburse such payment from the Escrow Amount. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full
payment of any such obligations within such fifteen Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including
the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to but excluding the date such payment has
been made at a rate per annum equal to five percent. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed.  

Section
7.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.   
All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.  

Section
7.08 Escrow Agent.    

(a) Generally.The
Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount in escrow in accordance with this Agreement.  

(b) Distributions
from Escrow Fund. In the event that a Loss shall be agreed to by Seller and Escrow Agent shall have received written notice thereof
from Seller or a final non-appealable judgment shall have been rendered by the court having jurisdiction over the matters relating
to such claim by the Buyer for indemnification from the Sellers and the Escrow Agent shall have received, a copy thereof, subject
to the Basket, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Buyer from the Escrow Amount the amount agreed to or determined by the court
to be owed to Buyer under Article VII in accordance with the terms herein.  

(c) Termination
of Escrow. If there are no indemnifiable pending Claims for against such amount, $50,000 of the Escrow Amount shall be disbursed
to Seller on January 7, 2017 and any balance shall be disbursed on July 7, 2017.   

(d) Dispute.
In the event that the Seller subject to indemnification obligation under such notice, gives the Escrow Agent written notice contesting
all or any portion of such Damages, the claim will be deemed a contested claim and the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to withhold
such amount which is in dispute in accordance with Section 7.1.2 until such dispute is resolved.  

(e) Indemnity.
All parties hereto hereby indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred
by the Escrow Agent by reason of any act or failure to act taken in accordance with this Agreement, except as such liability,
cost or expense shall result from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement.   

Section
7.09 Exclusive Remedies.   
Subject to  Section 8.11 , the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and

other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
