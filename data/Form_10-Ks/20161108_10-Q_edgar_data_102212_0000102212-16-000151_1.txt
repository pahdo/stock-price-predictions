  Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Univest Corporation of Pennsylvania (the Corporation or  Univest) and its wholly owned subsidiaries; the Corporation s primary subsidiary is Univest Bank and Trust Co. (the Bank). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations for interim financial information. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. Operating results for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . It is suggested that these unaudited consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes include fair value measurement of investment securities available-for-sale and assessment for impairment of certain investment securities, reserve for loan and lease losses, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets and liabilities, benefit plans and stock-based compensation expense. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) to provide guidance for eight cash flow classification issues for certain cash receipts and cash payments with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The issues identified within the ASU include: debt prepayments or extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years for public business entities that are SEC filers, or January 1, 2018 for the Corporation. The Corporation does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to require businesses and other organizations to measure the current expected credit losses (CECL) on financial assets, such as loans, net investments in leases, certain debt securities, bond insurance and other receivables. The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. Current GAAP requires an incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonableness and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. An entity should apply the amendments through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (modified-retrospective approach). Acquired credit impaired loans for which the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 310-30 has been previously applied should prospectively apply the guidance in this ASU. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized before the effective date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years for public business entities that are SEC filers, or January 1, 2020 for the Corporation. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation's financial statements; however, it is anticipated that the allowance will increase upon adoption of CECL and that the increased allowance level will decrease regulatory capital and ratios.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify and improve employee share-based payment accounting. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. The additional paid-in capital pool is eliminated. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized in the period they are deducted on the income tax return. Excess tax benefits are recorded along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies and changes to diluted earnings per share are to be applied prospectively when this ASU is adopted. For tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced taxes payable, entities record a cumulative-effect adjustment in retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The Corporation does not record deferred tax benefits on incentive stock options when expense is accrued, therefore, the Corporation will not have a cumulative-effect adjustment when this ASU is adopted. Changes to the treatment of forfeitures will not impact the Corporation as the historical assumption for forfeitures was immaterial and not taken into account during valuations; the Corporation has recorded forfeitures as they occurred which is consistent with the new guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public business entities, or January 1, 2017 for the Corporation. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted. The Corporation does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to amend the guidance for hedge accounting to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements of public businesses issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, or January 1, 2017 for the Corporation. The Corporation does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have any impact on the financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to revise the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. Disclosures will be required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. The ASU is effective for the first interim period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, or January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation's financial statements; however, the adoption of this ASU will impact the balance sheet for the recording of assets and liabilities for operating leases; any initial or continued impact of the recording of assets will have an impact on risk-based capital ratios under current regulatory guidance and possibly equity ratios.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. When fair value is not readily determinable, an entity may elect to measure the equity investment at cost, minus impairment, plus or minus any change in the investment s observable price. The ASU will simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. A valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities will need to be included. For financial liabilities that are measured at fair value, the ASU requires an entity to present separately, in other comprehensive income, any change in fair value resulting from a change in instrument-specific credit risk. An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 or January 1, 2018 for the Corporation. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation's financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an ASU simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments related to business combinations. The ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. Under this ASU, measurement-period adjustments are calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined. The ASU requires additional disclosures about the impact on current period income statement line items of adjustments that would have been recognized in prior periods if prior period information had been revised. The amendments in this ASU were effective for financial statements of public businesses issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years

beginning after December 15, 2015, or January 1, 2016 for the Corporation. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Corporation's financial statements.  
   In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability shall be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. The ASU was effective for financial statements of public businesses issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, or January 1, 2016 for the Corporation. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Corporation's balance sheet presentation as the Corporation followed this presentation consistent with the guidance in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU regarding revenue from contracts with customers which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The ASU establishes a core principle that would require an entity to identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The ASU provides for improved disclosure requirements that require entities to disclose sufficient information that enables users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying the implementation guidance on the principal-versus-agent considerations in the revenue recognition standard by instructing the participants in the sale to determine whether they control the good or service and are entitled to the gross amount of the transaction or are acting as an agent and should collect only a fee or commission for arranging the sale. In April 2016, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying the identification of performance obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the  FASB issued an ASU providing some limited improvements and practical expedients. The original effective date of the guidance relating to revenue from contracts with customers was deferred in August 2015 by one year. This guidance is now effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, or January 1, 2018 for the Corporation.  The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation's financial statements; however, it is anticipated the impact will be only related to timing.  

Note 2. Acquisition 
  Fox Chase Bancorp 
    On   July 1, 2016  , the Corporation completed the merger of Fox Chase Bancorp into the Corporation and Fox Chase Bank into Univest Bank and Trust Co. Fox Chase Bank was a locally-managed institution with locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and headquartered in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. The Corporation's presence expanded in Bucks, Chester, Philadelphia and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania and into Cape May county in New Jersey, complementing and expanding the Corporation's existing network of financial centers.  The fair value of total assets acquired as a result of the merger totaled   $1.1 billion  , loans totaled   $776.3 million   and deposits totaled   $738.3 million  . In accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 8, 2015, holders of shares of Fox Chase common stock received, in aggregate,   $98.9 million   in cash and   6,857,529   shares or approximately   26%   of the post transaction outstanding shares of the Corporation's common stock. The transaction was valued at   $242.2 million   based on Corporation s June 30, 2016 closing share price of   $21.02   as quoted on NASDAQ. The results of the combined entity s operations are included in the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. 
  The acquisition of Fox Chase is being accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which includes estimating the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration paid as of the acquisition date. These preliminary estimates will be subject to adjustments during and up to one year measurement period after the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Fox Chase and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as of the acquisition date: 

*Goodwill is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The goodwill and core deposit intangible are allocated to the Banking business segment. 
  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities required the Corporation to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which required the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.  
  Cash and due from banks:    The estimated fair values of cash and due from banks approximated their stated value. 
  Investment securities available-for-sale:    The estimated fair values of the investment securities available for sale, primarily comprised of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds, were determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values were determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Corporation s independent pricing service utilized evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. Because  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. Management reviewed the data and assumptions used in pricing the securities. A fair value premium of   $3.4 million   was recorded and will be amortized over the estimated life of the investments (estimated average remaining life of   3.7 years  ) using the interest rate method. 
  .  Loans held for investment:   The most significant fair value determination related to the valuation of acquired loans. The acquisition resulted in loans acquired with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration. There was no carryover related allowance for loan and lease losses. 
  The acquired loan portfolio was valued based on current guidance which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Level 3 inputs were utilized to value the portfolio and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporated assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values. In instances where reliable market information was not available, the Corporation used assumptions in an effort to determine reasonable fair value. Specifically, management utilized three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment. The three separate fair valuation methodologies used were: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value analysis; and 3) specific credit fair value analysis. 
  For loans acquired without evidence of credit quality deterioration, the Corporation prepared the interest rate loan fair value analysis. Loans were grouped by characteristics such as loan type, term, collateral and rate. Market rates for similar loans were obtained from various external data sources and reviewed by management for reasonableness. The average of these rates was used as the fair value interest rate a market participant would utilize. A present value approach was utilized to calculate the interest rate fair value adjustment. Additionally a general credit fair value adjustment was calculated using a two part general credit fair value analysis: 1) expected lifetime credit migration losses; and 2) estimated fair value adjustment for qualitative factors, liquidity and  an additional discount for loans considered to have heightened risk but not considered impaired. 
   The expected lifetime losses were calculated using an average of historical losses of the Bank, Fox Chase Bank and peer banks. The Corporation also estimated an environmental factor to apply to each loan type.  The environmental factor represents potential discount which may arise due to general economic conditions. Fox Chase's loan portfolio without evidence of credit quality deterioration was recorded at a current fair value of   $762.5 million  . A fair value premium of   $4.7 million   was recognized to reflect the fair values of loans. A fair value discount of   $8.5 million   was recognized to reflect the general credit risk of the loan portfolio. The adjustment will be substantially recognized as interest income over approximately   10   years on a level yield amortization method based upon the expected life of the loans.  
  For loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration , the Corporation prepared a specific credit fair value adjustment. Management reviewed the acquired loan portfolio for loans meeting the definition of an impaired loan with deteriorated credit quality. Loans meeting this definition were reviewed by comparing the contractual cash flows to expected collectible cash flows. The aggregate expected cash flows less the acquisition date fair value results in an accretable yield amount. The accretable discount amount will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield. Any disposals of loans, including sales of loans, payments in full or foreclosures result in the derecognition of the loan at its carrying value with differences in actual results reflected in interest income.  
   At the acquisition date, the Corporation recorded   $13.7 million   of acquired impaired loans. The aggregate expected cash flows less the acquisition date fair value results in an accretable discount amount of   $283 thousand  , which will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield.   Contractual cashflows not expected to be collected of   $11.1 million   resulted in an unaccretable fair value discount of    $5.7 million  .  
  The following is a summary of the acquired impaired loans at July 1, 2016 resulting from the acquisition with  Fox Chase:

Bank premises:    The Corporation assumed ten owned properties. The fair value was determined taking into consideration the highest and best use of the properties from a market participant perspective.  For those properties that the Corporation have held-for-sale, the fair value is reduced by the costs to sell. The fair value of  bank premises were determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of  the buildings of   $4.7 million   will be amortized over an estimated life of   30   years.

Other real estate owned:    The Corporation assumed five other real estate owned properties. The fair value was determined taking into consideration the highest and best use of the properties from a market participant perspective, including management assumptions when comparative data is not available, and is reduced by the costs to sell.  The fair value of  other real estate owned was determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Bank owned life insurance:    The fair value was determined at the cash surrender value of the policies.  
  Core deposit intangible:    Core deposit intangible represents the value assigned to demand, interest checking, money market and savings accounts acquired as part of the acquisition. The core deposit intangible fair value represents the future economic benefit, including the present value of future tax benefits, of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost of alternative funding sources and was valued utilizing Level 3 inputs. The core deposit intangible of   $5.3 million   will be amortized using the sum of the years digits method over an estimated life of   10   years.  
  Deposits:    The fair values of demand and saving deposits, with no stated maturities, approximated the carrying value as these accounts are payable on demand. The fair values of time deposits with fixed maturities were estimated by discounting the final maturity using current market interest rate for similar instruments. A fair value premium of   $832 thousand   was recorded and will be recognized as a reduction to interest expense using a level yield amortization method over the life of the time deposit. The fair value of time deposits were determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Federal funds and short-term borrowings:    Fair values federal funds and short-term borrowings were estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on rates currently available to the Bank for advances with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value of federal funds and short-term borrowings was determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.  A fair value premium of   $72 thousand   was recorded and will be recognized as a reduction to interest expense using a level yield amortization method over the life of the borrowings. 
  Long-term debt:     Fair values of long-term debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on rates currently available to the Bank for advances with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value of long-term borrowings was determined using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. A fair value premium of   $3.4 million   was recognized and will be recognized as a reduction to interest expense using a level yield amortization method over the life of the debt. 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities:    Deferred tax assets and liabilities were established for purchase accounting fair value adjustments as the future amortization/accretion of these adjustments represent temporary differences between book income and taxable income. 
  Direct costs related to the acquisition were expensed as incurred. For the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation incurred   $14.1 million   and   $15.6 million  , respectively, of Fox Chase integration and acquisition-related costs, which have been separately stated in the Corporation's consolidated statements of income.

  The following table shows the amortized cost and the estimated fair value of the held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by contractual maturity within each type:   

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because debt issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. Unrealized losses in investment securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   do not represent other-than-temporary impairments in management's judgment.

Securities with a carrying value of   $365.4 million   and   $210.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes as required by law. 
  The following table presents information related to sales of securities available-for-sale during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Management evaluates debt securities, which are comprised of U.S. government, government sponsored agencies, municipalities, corporate bonds and other issuers, for other-than-temporary impairment by considering the current economic conditions, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, market interest rates and the bond rating of each security. All of the debt securities are rated as investment grade and management believes that it will not incur any losses. The unrealized losses on the Corporation s investments in debt securities are temporary in nature since they are primarily related to market interest rates and are not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell the debt securities and believes it is more likely than not, that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis. The Corporation did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges on debt securities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The Corporation evaluates its equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment and recognizes other-than-temporary impairment charges when it has determined that it is probable that the fair value of certain equity securities will not recover to the Corporation s cost basis in the individual securities within a reasonable period of time due to a decline in the financial stability of the underlying companies. Management evaluates the near-term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery of the Corporation s cost basis occurs. The Corporation did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its equity portfolio during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   investments in any single non-federal issuer representing more than   10%   of shareholders  equity.

  Credit Quality Indicators 
  The following tables present by class, the recorded investment in loans and leases held for investment by credit quality indicator at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Corporation employs a ten (10) grade risk rating system related to the credit quality of commercial loans and residential real estate loans secured for a business purpose of which the first six categories are pass categories (credits not adversely rated). The following is a description of the internal risk ratings and the likelihood of loss related to each risk rating. Loans with risk ratings of one through five are reviewed based on the relationship dollar amount with the borrower: loans with a relationship total of   $2.5   million or greater are reviewed quarterly; loans with a relationship balance of less than   $2.5   million but greater than   $500   thousand are reviewed annually based on the borrower s fiscal year; loans with a relationship balance of less than   $500   thousand are reviewed only if the loan becomes   60 days   or more past due. Loans with a risk rating of six are also reviewed based on the relationship dollar amount with the borrower: loans with a relationship balance of   $2.0   million or greater are reviewed quarterly; loans with a relationship balance of less than   $2.0   million but greater than   $500   thousand are reviewed annually; loans with a relationship balance of less than   $500   thousand are reviewed only if the loan becomes 60 days or more past due. Loans with a risk rating of seven are reviewed at least quarterly, and as often as monthly, at management s discretion. Loans with risk ratings of eight through ten are reviewed monthly.

  The Corporation monitors the credit risk profile by payment activity for the following classifications of loans and leases: residential real estate loans secured for a personal purpose, home equity loans secured for a personal purpose, loans to individuals and lease financings. Nonperforming loans and leases are loans past due 90 days or more, loans and leases on nonaccrual of interest and troubled debt restructured loans and lease modifications. Performing loans and leases are reviewed only if the loan becomes 60 days or more past due. Nonperforming loans and leases are reviewed monthly. Performing loans and leases have a nominal to moderate risk of loss. Nonperforming loans and leases are loans or leases with a well-defined weakness and where collection in-full is unlikely.

Risks associated with lending activities include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and economic conditions, which may adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, and impact the value of the associated collateral. 
  Commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and residential real estate loans with a business purpose are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers  ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties and factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. 
  Commercial, financial and agricultural business loans are typically based on the borrowers  ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans often depreciates over time, is difficult to appraise and liquidate and fluctuates in value based on the success of the business. 
  Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest). During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral. Included in real estate-construction is track development financing. Risk factors related to track development financing include the demand for residential housing and the real estate valuation market. When projects move slower than anticipated, the properties may have significantly lower values than when the original underwriting was completed, resulting in lower collateral values to support the loan. Extended time frames also cause the interest carrying cost for a project to be higher than the builder projected, negatively impacting the builder s profit and cash flow and, therefore, their ability to make principal and interest payments. 
  Commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans with a business purpose secured by owner-occupied properties are dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business. If the operating company suffers difficulties in terms of sales volume and/or profitability, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Loans secured by properties where repayment is dependent upon payment of rent by third party tenants or the sale of the property may be impacted by loss of tenants, lower lease rates needed to attract new tenants or the inability to sell a completed project in a timely fashion and at a profit. 
  Commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and residential real estate loans secured for a business purpose are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. While the Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place, these procedures cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans. 
  The Corporation focuses on both assessing the borrower s capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees. Commercial real estate and residential real estate loans secured for a business purpose are originated primarily within the Southeastern Pennsylvania market area at conservative loan-to-value ratios and often with a guarantee of the borrowers.  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

Management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that any credit concentrations by borrower or industry are closely monitored. 
  The Corporation originates fixed-rate and adjustable-rate real estate-residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1-to-4 family residential properties for personal purposes. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than   80%  . Residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the   80%   loan-to-value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance. 
  In the real estate-home equity loan portfolio secured for a personal purpose, credit exposure is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores and adherence to the Corporation s underwriting policies. Combined loan-to-value ratios are generally limited to   80%  , but increased to   85%   for the Corporation s strongest profile borrower. Other credit considerations and compensating factors may support higher combined loan-to-value ratios. 
  Credit risk for consumer loans is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and, if secured, collateral values. These loans are included within the portfolio of loans to individuals. 
  The primary risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations. The Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place to mitigate this risk. Risk also lies in the residual value of the underlying equipment. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, the Corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value.   The Corporation greatly reduces this risk primarily by using $1.00 buyout leases, in which the entire cost of the leased equipment is included in the contractual payments, leaving no residual payment at the end of the lease term.

acquisition measurement period, the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for loan loss, resulting in an increase to the allowance.  
  Impaired Loans 
  The following presents, by class of loans, the recorded investment and unpaid principal balance of impaired loans , the amounts of the impaired loans for which there is not an allowance for credit losses and the amounts for which there is an allowance for credit losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The impaired loans exclude loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality. 

Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, accruing troubled debt restructured loans and other accruing impaired loans for which it is probable that not all principal and interest payments due will be collectible in accordance with the contractual terms. These loans are individually measured to determine the amount of potential impairment. The loans are reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and for certain loans based on discounted cash flows using the loans  initial effective interest rates. Impaired loans include other accruing impaired loans of   $21.2 million   and   $30.0 million

The Corporation grants concessions primarily related to extensions of interest-only payment periods and an occasional payment modification. These modifications typically are for a short-term basis   up to one year  . The goal when restructuring a credit is to establish a reasonable period of time to provide cash flow relief to customers experiencing cash flow difficulties. Accruing troubled debt restructured loans are primarily comprised of loans on which interest is being accrued under the restructured terms, and the loans are current or   less than ninety days past due  .

The Corporation has originated mortgage servicing rights which are included in other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income on a basis similar to the interest method and an accelerated amortization method for loan payoffs. Mortgage servicing rights are subject to impairment testing on a quarterly basis. The aggregate fair value of these rights was   $7.4 million   and   $8.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights was determined using a discount rate of   10.0%   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Changes in the mortgage servicing rights balance are summarized as follows: 

There was   no   activity in the valuation allowance for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

Note 6. Income Taxes 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Corporation had no material unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest or penalties. Penalties are recorded in noninterest expense in the year they are assessed and are treated as a non-deductible expense for tax purposes. Interest is recorded in noninterest expense in the year it is assessed and is treated as a deductible expense for tax purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation s tax years   2013   through   2015   remain subject to federal examination as well as examination by state taxing jurisdictions. 
   
  Note 7. Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 
  Substantially all employees who were hired before   December 8, 2009   are covered by a noncontributory retirement plan. Employees hired on or after   December 8, 2009   are not eligible to participate in the noncontributory retirement plan. The Corporation also provides supplemental executive retirement benefits to certain former executives, a portion of which is in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by federal tax law; these plans are non-qualified benefit plans. These non-qualified benefit plans are not offered to new participants; all current participants are now retired. Information on these plans are aggregated and reported under  Retirement Plans  within this footnote. 
  The Corporation also provides certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Information on these benefits is reported under  Other Postretirement Benefits  within this footnote. 
  The Corporation sponsors a Supplemental Non-Qualified Pension Plan which was established in 1981 prior to the existence of a 401(k) deferred salary savings plan, employee stock purchase plan and long-term incentive plans and therefore is not offered to new participants; all current participants are now retired.

The Corporation contributed   $2.0 million   to its qualified retirement plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Corporation previously disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , that it expected to make contributions of   $160 thousand   to its non-qualified retirement plans and   $117 thousand   to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2016. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation contributed   $120 thousand   to its non-qualified retirement plans and   $61 thousand   to its other postretirement plans. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.9 million   was paid to participants from the retirement plans and   $61 thousand   was paid to participants from the other postretirement plans. 
   
  Note 8. Borrowings 
  Short-term borrowings 
  Short-term borrowings consist of overnight borrowings and term borrowings with a remaining maturity of less than one year. Short-term borrowings are obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and correspondent banks. At   September 30, 2016  , short-term borrowings consisted of federal funds purchased of   $125.0 million  , borrowings with the FHLB of   $64.0 million   and customer repurchase agreements of   $22.3 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , short-term borrowings consisted of customer repurchase agreements of   $24.2 million  . 
  Long-term debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had long-term debt with the FHLB of   $61.5 million  . These borrowings have contractual maturity dates in 2017 and 2018 and fixed interest rates with a weighted average interest rate of   0.87%   at   September 30, 2016  . FHLB borrowings totaling   $51.5 million   have a "Call Date"; if the borrowing is called, the Corporation has the option to either pay off the borrowing without penalty or the fixed rate borrowing resets to a variable three-month LIBOR based rate. Subsequent to the call date, the borrowings are callable by the FHLB quarterly. Accordingly, the contractual maturities may differ from actual maturities.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had long-term debt under security repurchase agreements of $  31.4 million  . These borrowings  have contractual maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2020 with a weighted average interest rate of   0.81%   at   September 30, 2016  . These borrowings are primarily variable based on the one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread; one borrowing for   $5.3 million   has a fixed interest rate and may be called by the lender based on the underlying agreement.  
  The short-term borrowings and long-term debt balances and weighted average interest rates include purchase accounting fair value adjustments, net of related amortization from the Fox Chase acquisition.

Subordinated Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Corporation had   $94.0 million   and   $49.4 million  , respectively, of long-term subordinated notes. On   July 1, 2016  , the Corporation completed the issuance of   $45.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the "2016 Notes") due 2026 in a private placement transaction to institutional accredited investors. 
  The net proceeds of the offering, which approximated   $44.5 million  , will be used for general corporate purposes and to support both organic growth as well as potential acquisitions should such opportunities arise. The subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, subject to applicable limitations.  
  The 2016 Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of   5.00%   from the date of issuance until   June 30, 2021  , or any early redemption date, with the first interest payment on the 2016 Notes occurring on December 30, 2016 and semi-annually thereafter each June 30 and December 30, to but excluding June 30, 2021. From and including June 30, 2021 to but excluding the maturity date of June 30, 2026 (or any early redemption date), the 2016 Notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR rate plus   3.90%  , payable quarterly in arrears on each March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30. Beginning with the interest payment date of   June 30, 2021  , the Corporation has the option on each interest payment date, subject to approval of the Federal Reserve Board, to redeem the 2016 Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the redeemed 2016 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption. The Corporation may also redeem the 2016 Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon the occurrence of certain tax, regulatory capital and Investment Company Act of 1940 Act events, subject in each case to the approval of the Federal Reserve. 
  On April 25, 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency ("KBRA") affirmed its credit rating for the Corporation and the Bank with a stable outlook. Specifically, KBRA affirmed the Corporation's senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+, subordinated debt rating of BBB and short-term rating of K2. With regard to the Bank, KBRA affirmed the Bank's deposit rating of A-, short-term debt rating of K2 and short-term deposit rating of K2 while also assigning the Bank a senior unsecured debt rating of A-. 
   
  Note 9. Earnings per Share 
  The Corporation uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Corporation's equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.   
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Note 11. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  The Corporation may use interest-rate swap agreements to modify interest rate characteristics from variable to fixed or fixed to variable in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future net interest income. Recorded amounts related to interest-rate swaps are included in other assets or liabilities. The Corporation s credit exposure on interest rate swaps includes fair value and any collateral that is held by a third party. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges of future cash flows are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying forecasted transactions occur, at which time the deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings. For a qualifying fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in earnings, and the change in fair value of the hedge item, to the extent attributable to the hedged risk, adjusts the carrying amount of the hedge item and is recognized in earnings.  
  On October 24, 2014, the Corporation entered into an amortizing interest rate swap classified as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of   $20.0 million   to hedge a portion of the debt financing of a pool of   10  -year maturity fixed rate loans with balances totaling   $29.1 million  , at time of the hedge, that were originated in 2013. A brokered money market demand account with a balance exceeding the amortizing interest rate swap balance is being used for the cash flow hedge. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the Corporation pays a fixed rate of   2.10%   and receives a floating rate based on the   one-month     LIBOR   . The swap matures in   November 2022  . The Corporation performed an assessment of the hedge for effectiveness at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine that the derivative has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. The Corporation expects that there will be no ineffectiveness over the life of the interest rate swap, and therefore anticipates no portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into interest expense. To the extent there is ineffectiveness, the Corporation would record the ineffectiveness in interest expense. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $252 thousand   in net deferred losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of the interest rate swap was   $18.7 million  , with a   negative   fair value of   $1.0 million  . The Corporation has pledged cash of    $1.3 million   to the counterparty as collateral for the negative fair value. 
  The Corporation (through the acquisition of Fox Chase) has an interest rate swap classified as a fair value hedge with a current notional amount of   $1.4 million   to hedge a   10  -year fixed rate loan that is earning interest at   5.83%  . The Corporation pays a fixed rate of   5.83%   and receives a floating rate based on the one-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The swap matures in October 2021. The difference between changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreement and the hedged loan represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations.  
  The Corporation (through the acquisition of Fox Chase) has an interest rate swap with a current notional amount of   $646 thousand  , for a   15  -year fixed rate loan that is earning interest at   7.43%  . The Corporation pays a fixed rate of   7.43%   and receives a floating rate based on the one-month LIBOR plus 224 basis points. The swap matures in April 2022. The interest rate swap is carried at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging." The loan is carried at fair value under the fair value option as permitted by FASB ASC 825 "Financial Instruments."   
  Credit Derivatives  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

The Corporation has agreements with third-party financial institutions whereby the third-party financial institution enters into interest rate derivative contracts and foreign currency swap contracts with loan customers referred to them by the Corporation. By the terms of the agreements, the third-party financial institution has recourse to the Corporation for any exposure created under each swap contract in the event the customer defaults on the swap agreement and the agreement is in a paying position to the third-party financial institution. These transactions represent credit derivatives and are a customary arrangement that allows the Corporation to provide access to interest rate and foreign currency swap transactions for customers without creating the swap. The Corporation records the fair value of credit derivatives in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation recognizes changes in the fair value of credit derivatives, net of any fees received, in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation  (primarily through the acquisition of Fox Chase) has   five   variable-rate to fixed-rate interest rate swap transactions between the third-party financial institution and customers with a current notional amount of   $16.5 million  , and remaining maturities ranging from   three   to   10   years. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the swaps to the customers was a liability of   $431 thousand   and all swaps were in paying positions to the third-party financial institution.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were no material foreign currency swap transactions between the third-party institution and loan customers. 
  The maximum potential payments by the Corporation to the third-party financial institution under these credit derivatives are not estimable as they are contingent on future interest rates and exchange rates, and the agreement does not provide for a limitation of the maximum potential payment amount. 
  Mortgage Banking Derivatives 
  Derivative loan commitments represent agreements for delayed delivery of financial instruments in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver, at a specified future date, a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. The Corporation s derivative loan commitments are commitments to sell loans secured by 1-to 4-family residential properties whose predominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk. The fair values of these derivative loan commitments are based upon the estimated amount the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the contracts or agreements, taking into account current interest rates and, when appropriate, the current creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
  Derivatives Tables 
  The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of derivatives designated as hedging instruments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Corporation pledges cash or securities to cover the negative fair value of derivative instruments. Cash collateral associated with derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts.

Note 12. Fair Value Disclosures 
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair value of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Corporation. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Corporation s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances, including assumptions about risk. Three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. 
  Level 1: Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation can access at the measurement date. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 
  Level 2: Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
  Level 3: Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include: financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash-flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the fair value calculation requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
  Investment Securities 
  Where quoted prices are available in an active market for identical instruments, investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 investment securities include U.S. Treasury securities, most equity securities and money market mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered investment companies which are valued at net asset value of shares on a market exchange at the end of each trading day. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Examples of instruments, which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate and municipal bonds and certain equity securities. In cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, investment securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
  Fair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Corporation s independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. If at any time, the pricing service determines that it does not have sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security, the Corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service. Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control. 
  On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reviews changes, as submitted by the pricing service, in the market value of its security portfolio. Individual changes in valuations are reviewed for consistency with general interest rate movements and any known credit concerns for specific securities. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, the Corporation has its security portfolio priced by a second pricing service to determine consistency with another market evaluator. If, upon the Corporation s review or in comparing with another service, a material difference between pricing evaluations were to exist, the Corporation may submit an inquiry to the current pricing service regarding the data used to determine the valuation of a particular security. If the Corporation determines there is market information that would support a different valuation than from the current pricing service s evaluation, the Corporation may utilize  and change the security's valuation. There were no material differences in valuations noted at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based upon the estimated amount the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the contracts or agreements, taking into account current interest rates and, when appropriate, the current creditworthiness of the counterparties. Interest rate swaps and mortgage banking derivative financial instruments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Credit derivatives are valued based on credit worthiness of the underlying borrower which is a significant unobservable input and therefore classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

Two commercial loans, associated with interest rate swaps are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy since lending credit risk is not an observable input for these loans. The unrealized gain on the   two   loans was   $160 thousand   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Contingent Consideration Liability 
  The Corporation estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by using a discounted cash flow model of future contingent payments based on projected revenue related to the acquired business. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any valuation adjustments resulting from a change of estimated future contingent payments based on projected revenue of the acquired business affecting the contingent consideration liability will be recorded through noninterest expense. Changes in the original assumptions utilized at the time the acquisition closes and identified during the measurement period are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 805 as an adjustment to goodwill. Due to the significant unobservable input related to the projected revenue, the contingent consideration liability is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An increase in the projected revenue may result in a higher fair value of the contingent consideration liability. Alternatively, a decrease in the projected revenue may result in a lower estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability. 
  For the Sterner Insurance Associates acquisition, the potential remaining cash payment that could result from the contingent consideration arrangement range from   $0   to a maximum of   $2.6 million   based on the results for the   twelve  -month period June 30   2017  . Due to updates to the original assumptions utilized for determining the contingent consideration liability for the Sterner acquisition completed on July 1, 2014, the Corporation recorded a purchase accounting adjustment, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, in the first quarter of 2015 which resulted in an increase to the contingent consideration liability and an increase to goodwill of    $1.5 million  . 
  For the Girard Partners acquisition, the potential remaining three cash payments that could result from the contingent consideration arrangement range from   $0   to a maximum of   $12.9 million   cumulative based on the results for the   three  -year periods ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and   2018  , respectively. The Corporation recorded a reduction to the contingent liability during the fourth quarter of 2015 which resulted in a reduction of noninterest expense of   $550 thousand  . The adjustment reflected that projected revenue levels for earn-out payments in the second  through fifth years post-acquisition are anticipated to be lower than originally projected. 
  The following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , classified using the fair value hierarchy:

*Includes adjustments during the measurement period in accordance with ASC Topic 805. 
  The Corporation may be required to periodically measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or impairment charges of individual assets. The following table represents assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The disclosed fair values are classified using the fair value hierarchy.

The following valuation methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in estimating the fair value for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets but for which the fair value is required to be disclosed: 
  Cash and short-term interest-earning assets:   The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments approximates those assets  fair values. Cash and short-term interest-earning assets are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Held-to-maturity securities:   Fair values for the held-to-maturity investment securities are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other stock:   It is not practical to determine the fair values of Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other stock, due to restrictions placed on their transferability.  
  Loans held for sale:   The fair value of the Corporation s mortgage loans held for sale are generally determined using a pricing model based on current market information obtained from external sources, including interest rates, bids or indications provided by market participants on specific loans that are actively marketed for sale. These loans are primarily residential mortgage loans and are generally classified in Level 2 due to the observable pricing data. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. There were   no   valuation adjustments for loans held for sale at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Loans and leases held for investment:   The fair values for loans and leases held for investment are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using a discount rate based on current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers and include components for credit risk, operating expense and embedded prepayment options. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks in addition to general portfolio risk and is significant to the valuation. As permitted, the fair value of the loans and leases are not based on the exit price concept as discussed in the first paragraph of this note. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Impaired loans held for investment:   Impaired loans held for investment include those collateral-dependent loans for which the practical expedient was applied, resulting in a fair-value adjustment to the loan. Impaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans less costs to sell and is classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of collateral  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

is based on appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Corporation. At   September 30, 2016  , impaired loans held for investment had a carrying amount of   $39.0 million   with a valuation allowance of   $5 thousand  . At   December 31, 2015  , impaired loans held for investment had a carrying amount of   $48.9 million   with a valuation allowance of   $322 thousand  . 
  Mortgage servicing rights:   The Corporation estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights using discounted cash flow models that calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model uses readily available prepayment speed assumptions for the interest rates of the portfolios serviced. Mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Corporation reviews the mortgage servicing rights portfolio on a quarterly basis for impairment and the mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , mortgage servicing rights had a carrying amount of   $6.2 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, with   no   valuation allowance. 
  Goodwill and other identifiable assets:   Certain non-financial assets subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no triggering events that required valuation of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. 
  Other real estate owned:   The fair value of other real estate owned (OREO) is originally estimated based upon the appraised value less estimated costs to sell. The fair value less cost to sell becomes the "original cost" of the OREO asset. Subsequently, OREO is reported as the lower of the original cost and the current the fair value less cost to sell. Capital improvement expenses associated with the construction or repair of the property are capitalized as part of the cost of the OREO asset; however, the capitalized expenses may not increase the OREO asset's recorded value to an amount greater than the asset's fair value after improvements and less cost to sell. New appraisals are generally obtained on an annual basis. Other real estate owned is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
  Deposit liabilities:   The fair values for demand and savings accounts, with no stated maturities, is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (carrying value) and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values for time deposits with fixed maturities are estimated by discounting the final maturity using interest rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. Time deposits are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Short-term borrowings:   The fair value of short-term borrowings are estimated using current market rates for similar borrowings and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Long-term debt:   The fair value of long-term debt is estimated by using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Long-term debt is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Subordinated notes:   The fair value of the subordinated notes are estimated by discounting the principal balance using the treasury yield curve for the term to the call date as the Corporation has the option to call the subordinated notes. The subordinated notes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
  Off-balance-sheet instruments:   Fair values for the Corporation s off-balance-sheet instruments are based on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 13. Segment Reporting 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation has three reportable business segments: Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. The Corporation determines the segments based primarily upon product and service offerings, through the types of income generated and the regulatory environment. This is strategically how the Corporation operates and has positioned itself in the marketplace. Accordingly, significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of each of these segments. At   September 30, 2016  , these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure as a business segment. Non-reportable segments include the parent holding company and intercompany eliminations, and are included in the "Other" segment.  
  The Corporation's Banking segment consists of commercial and consumer banking. The Wealth Management segment consists of investment advisory services, retirement plan services, trust, municipal pension services and broker/dealer services. The Insurance segment consists of commercial lines, personal lines, benefits and human resources consulting.  
  Each segment generates revenue from a variety of products and services it provides. Examples of products and services provided for each reportable segment are indicated below. 
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

The Banking segment provides financial services to consumers, businesses and governmental units.

Note 14. Restructuring Charges 
  During the first quarter of 2015, the Corporation finalized a new financial center model, which is smaller in size, combines enhanced technology with personal service and provides consultive services and solutions delivered by personal bankers. These efforts led to the development of a comprehensive financial center optimization plan approved in April 2015 which includes opening new financial centers in growth markets while closing financial centers which operate in close proximity to other centers. As the Corporation announced in April 2015,   six   financial centers were closed in September 2015 that operated in close proximity to other centers. As a result, the Corporation recorded   $1.6 million   in restructuring charges during the second quarter of 2015 and related to the Banking business segment.  The Corporation negotiated more favorable lease termination agreements on   two   of the properties during 2016 resulting in a reversal in the accrual of   $152 thousand  . 
  During the third quarter of 2016 the Corporation closed   one   financial center resulting in accruing a loss of   $67 thousand  ; as a result of the Fox Chase acquisition and in an effort to optimize market visibility, financial centers which operate in close proximity to other centers are being analyzed.       
  A roll-forward of the accrued restructuring expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:

  Executive Overview 
  The Corporation s consolidated net income, earnings per share and return on average assets and average equity were as follows:  

The Corporation reported net income of   $58 thousand   or   $0.00   diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to reported net income of   $7.5 million   or   $0.39   diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $12.6 million   or   $0.57   diluted earnings per share, compared to   $20.1 million   or   $1.02   for the comparable period in the prior year. The financial results for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included $9.2 million and $10.6 million, net of tax, respectively, of acquisition  and integration related costs associated with the merger with Fox Chase Bancorp (Fox Chase) or a total of $0.35 and $0.48, respectively,

     Table of Contents  

of diluted earnings per share. The nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included  $2.4 million, net of tax, respectively, of integration and acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges incurred during the first and second quarter, or $0.12 of diluted earnings per share. The current quarter is the first reporting period reflecting financial results inclusive of Fox Chase which the Corporation acquired on July 1, 2016. On September 12, 2016, the Corporation completed the Fox Chase system conversion, moving all operations to the Corporation and providing all customers with access to an expanded financial center and ATM network. 
    
  Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $34.3 million  , an increase of   $9.5 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $84.1 million  , an increase of   $9.7 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   3.68%  , compared to   3.89%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .The increase in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin during the third quarter of 2016 was mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase Bank acquisition, which included a full quarter of average net interest-earning assets acquired. The favorable impact of acquisition accounting adjustments was 7 basis points for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 8 basis points for  the same period in the prior year.  
    
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million  , compared to   $670 thousand   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in the provision during 2016 was primarily due to organic loan growth and $1.7 million of net charge-offs. The provision for loan and lease losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.6 million  , compared to   $2.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Noninterest income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $14.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.4 million  , or   11.0%   from the same period in the prior year. Noninterest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $42.0 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.7 million  , or   7.0%   from the same period in the prior year. The increases were mainly due to increases in the net gain on mortgage banking activities resulting from higher volume of mortgage closings and increases in bank owned life insurance income resulting from purchases of policies, policies acquired from Fox Chase and transfers of policies to a higher yielding account structure. 
    
  Noninterest expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $47.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $21.8 million  , or   86.4%   from the same period in the prior year. Noninterest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $103.6 million  ,   an increase   of   $24.1 million  , or   30.3%   from the same period in the prior year. Acquisition and integration costs related to the Fox Chase merger were $14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs related to the Valley Green merger and new financial center model were $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Salaries and benefit expense increased   $4.7 million   and   $7.7 million   for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily attributable to higher staffing levels resulting from the Fox Chase acquisition, additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines and the expansion into Lancaster County. Premises and equipment expenses increased $544 thousand for the   three   months and $365 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to higher premises expense related to Fox Chase locations. Data processing expense increased $955 thousand for the   three   months and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to increased investments in computer software as well as a full quarter of Fox Chase processing expense. 
    
  Gross loans and leases held for investment increased   $1.0 billion   from   December 31, 2015  , including    $776.3 million   of loans acquired from Fox Chase. Organic loan growth, which excludes the loans acquired from Fox Chase at June 30, 2016 was $69.1 million or 2.2% (not annualized) from June 30, 2016 and $235.1 million or 8.0% (not annualized) from December 31, 2015. The growth in loans was primarily in commercial business, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans. Loan growth in 2016 resulted from new and existing customer relationships and Univest s strategic move to expand its presence and hire a lending team in Lancaster County to seize opportunities as a result of market disruption caused by other bank acquisitions. Loan growth also resulted from opportunities brought by Univest s new lending talent in its core market and through the acquisition of Fox Chase. 
    
  Deposits   increased     $784.1 million   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to   $738.3 million   of deposits acquired from Fox Chase. Organic deposit growth, which excludes the Fox Chase deposits at June 30, 2016, was $63.2 million, or 2.0%  (not annualized) from June 30, 2016 and $45.9 million or 1.5% (not annualized) from December 31, 2015. Total borrowings increased   $187.2 million   from December 31, 2015.  
    
  The Corporation and the Bank continue to remain well-capitalized at   September 30, 2016  . Total risk-based capital at   September 30, 2016   was   12.64%   for the Corporation and   11.80%   for the Bank, well in excess of the regulatory minimum for well-capitalized status of   10.00%  .

Results of Operations 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and leases, investments and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the principal source of the Corporation s revenue. Table 1 presents a summary of the Corporation s average balances, the tax-equivalent yields earned on average assets, and the cost of average liabilities, and shareholders  equity for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The tax-equivalent net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest spread represents the difference between the weighted average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of net interest free funding sources represents the effect on the net interest margin of net funding provided by noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders  equity. Table 2 analyzes the changes in the tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components.   
  Three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   2015 
  Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $34.3 million  , an increase of   $9.5 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $84.1 million  , an increase of   $9.7 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   3.68%  , compared to   3.89%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   3.82%   compared to   4.02%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin during the third quarter of 2016 were both primarily due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition, which included a full quarter of average net interest-earning assets acquired and related net interest income. The favorable impact of acquisition accounting adjustments was 7 basis points for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 8 basis points for  the same period in the prior year. The favorable impact of acquisition accounting adjustments was 5 basis points for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 11 basis points for  the same period in the prior year.

Interest Income 
  Three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   2015    
  Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $38.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $11.1 million   from the same period in   2015  . Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $92.6 million  ,   an increase   of   $12.4 million   from the same period in   2015  . The increases were mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition which included a full quarter of average interest-earning assets acquired and the related interest income. In addition, the positive benefit of interest income due to loan growth in commercial real estate, residential real estate and municipal loans was partially offset by decreases in loan interest rates due to re-pricing and the competitive environment. The net accretion of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments had no impact on the yield on total interest-earning assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a favorable impact of 7 basis points for the same period in the prior year. The favorable impact of acquisition accounting adjustments was 1 basis point on total interest-earning assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 8 basis points for the same period in the prior year. 
  Interest Expense 
  Three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus   2015    
  Interest expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.6 million   from the same period in   2015  . Interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.5 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.7 million   from the same period in   2015  . The increases were mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition which included a full quarter of average interest-bearing liabilities assumed and the related interest expense. Interest expense also included the subordinated debt issuance of $45.0 million on July 1, 2016 and $50.0 million on March 30, 2015 which increased quarterly interest expense by $594 thousand and year-to-date interest expense by $1.3 million over the same periods in the prior year. The net amortization of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments related to acquisitions favorably impacted the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities by 10 basis points for the   three   months   September 30, 2016   compared to 2 basis points for the same period in the prior year. The favorable impact of acquisition accounting adjustments was 5 basis points on total interest-bearing liabilities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 3 basis points for the same period in the prior year. 
  Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
  The reserve for loan and lease losses is determined through a periodic evaluation that takes into consideration the growth of the loan and lease portfolio, the status of past-due loans and leases, current economic conditions, various types of lending activity, policies, real estate and other loan commitments, and significant changes in charge-off activity. Loans are also reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and for certain loans based on discounted cash flows using the loans  initial effective interest rates. Any of the above criteria may cause the reserve to fluctuate. The provision for loan and lease losses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million   compared to   $670 thousand   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in the provision was primarily due to organic loan growth and $1.7 million of net charge-offs. The provision for loan and lease losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.6 million   compared to   $2.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Noninterest Income 
  Noninterest income consists of trust fee income, service charges on deposit accounts, commission income, net gains (losses) on sales of securities, net gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and other miscellaneous types of income. Other service fee income primarily consists of fees from credit card companies for a portion of merchant charges paid to the credit card companies for the Bank s customer debit card usage, non-customer debit card fees at the Bank's ATM, other merchant fees, mortgage servicing income and mortgage placement income. Bank owned life insurance income represents changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies, which is affected by the market value of the underlying assets, and also includes any excess proceeds from death benefit claims. The net gain on mortgage banking activities consists of gains (losses) on sales of mortgages held for sale and fair value adjustments on interest-rate locks and forward loan sale commitments. Other noninterest income includes other miscellaneous income.

Acquisition and integration costs related to the Fox Chase merger were $14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs related to the Valley Green merger and new financial center model were $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Salaries and benefit expense increased $4.7 million for the three months and $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily attributable to higher staffing levels resulting from the Fox Chase acquisition, additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines and the expansion into Lancaster County.

Data processing expense increased $955 thousand for the three months and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to increased investments in computer software as well as a full quarter of Fox Chase processing expense. Other noninterest expense increased primarily due to expenses related to Fox Chase operations, loan workout fees and other loan processing fees, real estate owned expense and other operating expenses. 
  Tax Provision 
  The provision for income taxes for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a benefit of   $1.5 million   and expense of   $2.8 million  , at effective rates of   104%   and   27%  , respectively. The provision for income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.3 million   and   $7.2 million   at effective rates of   21%   and   26%  , respectively. The effective tax rates reflect the benefits of tax-exempt income from investments in municipal securities, loans and bank-owned life insurance partially offset by non-deductible merger expenses. The decrease in the average effective tax rate from the prior year is mainly due a reduction in taxable income (primarily due to taxable acquisition-related and integration expenses of $14.1 million.

Financial Condition 
  Assets 
  The following table presents assets at the dates indicated: 

Investment Securities 
  The investment portfolio is managed as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating risk. Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically beneficial returns on these investments, and to collateralize public fund deposits and certain long-term debt. The securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agencies, municipals, residential mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. 
  Total investments at   September 30, 2016     increased     $113.5 million   from   December 31, 2015  . Securities acquired from Fox Chase of   $230.7 million  , purchases of   $58.8 million   and   increases   in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities of   $3.7 million   were partially offset by sales of   $75.3 million  , maturities and pay-downs of   $58.0 million   and calls of   $45.0 million  . The   increases   in fair value of available-for-sale investment securities were primarily due to the decrease in long-term interest rates during 2016. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other stock, at cost 
  Federal Home Loan Bank stock at   September 30, 2016     increased     $8.3 million   from   December 31, 2015   mainly due to purchase requirements related to the increase in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings from the Fox Chase acquisition. 
  Loans and Leases 
  Gross loans and leases held for investment increased   $1.0 billion   from   December 31, 2015  , including    $776.3 million   of loans acquired from Fox Chase. Organic loan growth, which excludes the loans acquired from Fox Chase at June 30, 2016, was $69.1 million, or  2.2% (not annualized) from June 30, 2016 and $235.1 million or 8.0% (not annualized) from December 31, 2015. The growth in loans was primarily in commercial business, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans.  
  Asset Quality 
  Performance of the entire loan and lease portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank management and lending officers. A number of factors regarding the borrower, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes. 
  When a loan or lease, including a loan or lease that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan or lease is discontinued. A loan or lease is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan or lease is currently performing. A loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

is reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. 
  Loans or leases are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in loans held for investment and loans held for sale that were considered to be impaired was   $39.0 million  . The related reserve for loan losses was   $5 thousand  . At   December 31, 2015  , the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired was   $48.9 million  . The related reserve for loan losses was   $322 thousand  . Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and leases, accruing troubled debt restructured loans and lease modifications and other accruing impaired loans for which it is probable that not all principal and interest payments due will be collectible in accordance with the contractual terms. The amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits. Specific reserves have been established based on current facts and management s judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits. Interest income recognized on impaired loans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.1 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , additional interest income that would have been recognized under the original terms for impaired loans was   $641 thousand   and   $998 thousand  , respectively.  
  The impaired loan balances consisted mainly of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. Commercial real estate impaired loans were   $23.0 million   and   $30.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Commercial business impaired loans were   $10.3 million   and   $12.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Other real estate owned was   $6.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . During the first quarter of 2016, three commercial real estate properties with a total fair value of $1.6 million and land with a fair value of $203 thousand were transferred to other real estate owned. During the second quarter of 2016, one commercial real estate property with a total fair value of $155 thousand was transferred to other real estate owned.  During the third quarter of 2016, two residential properties with a total fair value of $268 thousand and one commercial real estate property with a total fair value of $127 thousand were transferred to other real estate owned. The Corporation also acquired other real estate owned with a total fair value of   $2.5 million   from the Fox Chase acquisition.

Reserve for Loan and Lease Losses 
    
  Management believes the reserve for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level that is appropriate at   September 30, 2016   to absorb probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Management s methodology to determine the adequacy of and the provisions to the reserve considers specific credit reviews, past loan and lease loss experience, current economic conditions and trends, and the volume, growth, and composition of the portfolio. 
    
  The reserve for loan and lease loss analysis takes into consideration the growth of the loan and lease portfolio, the status of past-due loans and leases, current economic conditions, various types of lending activity, policies, real estate and other loan commitments, and significant changes in charge-off activity. Impaired loans, including nonaccrual loans and leases, troubled debt restructured loans and other accruing impaired loans are evaluated individually and a specific reserve is determined. The loans are reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and for certain loans based on discounted cash flows using the loans  initial effective interest rates. All other loans and leases are evaluated as pools. Based on historical loss experience and qualitative factors, loss factors are determined giving consideration to the areas noted in the preceding paragraph and applied to the pooled loan and lease categories to develop the general or allocated portion of the reserve.  
    
  The reserve for loan and lease losses is determined at the end of each quarter. Calculating the Corporation's reserve for loan and lease losses begins with the Bank's loan portfolio utilizing historical loss data as a starting point, while evaluating the impact of environmental factors in a quantitative manner as they relate to the collectability of outstanding loan obligations. The Corporation utilizes a rolling eight-quarter migration analysis and loss emergence period analysis to determine the annualized net expected loan loss experience. 
    
  Each quarter, the conditions that exist within the look-back period and loss emergence period are compared to current conditions to support a conclusion as to which qualitative adjustments are (or are not) deemed necessary for each loan portfolio segment. These factors are evaluated subjectively based on management's experience and supported by the Corporation's defined analytical metrics/drivers relative to the historical look-back period. Factors include, but are not limited to, asset quality trends, portfolio growth trends, changes in lending policies and management, economic trends, concentrations of credit risk and the impact of collateral dependent lending. 
    
  The reserve for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio under current economic conditions and such other factors, which deserve recognition in estimating loan and lease losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Additions to the reserve arise from the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off. Loan and lease charge-offs reduce the reserve. Loans and leases are charged off when there has been permanent impairment or when in the opinion of management the full amount of the loan or lease will not be realized. Certain impaired loans are reported at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, or for certain loans, at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate. 
    
  The reserve for loan and lease losses consists of an allocated reserve and unallocated reserve categories. The allocated reserve is comprised of reserves established on specific loans and leases, and class reserves based on historical loan and lease loss experience and qualitative factors, current trends, and management assessments. The unallocated reserve supports other risk considerations not readily quantifiable through the allocated reserve metrics outlined above, as well as the inherent imprecision of the reserve for loan and lease losses model complexity. These considerations include, but are not limited to, the improving credit risk profile of performing loans individually measured for impairment, less than fully seasoned home equity portfolio metrics and reclassification of loan settlement exposures.

     Table of Contents  

The Corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off-balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded in categories with historical loss experience. The reserve for these off-balance sheet credits was   $422 thousand   and   $381 thousand   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the Corporation in connection with acquisitions. The Corporation has covenants not to compete, core deposit and customer-related intangibles and mortgage servicing rights, which are not deemed to have an indefinite life and therefore will continue to be amortized over their useful life using the present value of projected cash flows. The amortization of intangible assets was   $1.3 million   and   $844 thousand   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The amortization of intangible assets was   $3.0 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" for a summary of intangible assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation also has goodwill with a net carrying value of   $172.1 million   and   $112.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is deemed to be an indefinite intangible asset and is not amortized. The increase in goodwill of   $59.4 million   was related to the Fox Chase acquisition completed on July 1, 2016. 
    
  The Corporation completes a goodwill impairment analysis at least on an annual basis, or more often, if events and circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Corporation also completes an impairment test for other identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangibles during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Since the last annual impairment analysis during   2015  , there have been no circumstances to indicate impairment. There can be no assurance that future impairment assessments or tests will not result in a charge to earnings. 
    
  Other Assets 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank held   $6.6 million   in Federal Reserve Bank stock as required by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, and as such, is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership as determined by the FHLB. The Bank is required to hold additional stock in the FHLB in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The Bank held FHLB stock of   $10.5 million   and   $2.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Additionally, the FHLB might require its members to increase their capital stock investments. Changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. government and federal agencies, including the FHLB, could increase the borrowing costs of the FHLB and possibly have a negative impact on the FHLB operations and long-term performance. It is possible this could have an adverse effect on the value of the Corporation s investment in FHLB stock. The Corporation determined there was no other-than-temporary impairment of the investment in FHLB stock. Therefore, at   September 30, 2016  , the FHLB stock is recorded at cost. 

Liabilities 
  The following table presents liabilities at the dates indicated:

Table of Contents  

Deposits 
  Total deposits   increased     $784.1 million   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to   $738.3 million   of deposits acquired from Fox Chase. Organic deposit growth, which excludes the Fox Chase deposits at June 30, 2016, was $63.2 million, or 2.0% (not annualized) from June 30, 2016 and $45.9 million or 1.5% from December 31, 2015.  
   
  Borrowings 
  Total borrowings increased $324.8 million from December 31, 2015 mainly due to long-term borrowings acquired from Fox Chase which consisted of $90.0 million principal amount of Federal Home Loan bank borrowings and funds obtained from commercial banks under security repurchase agreements, the issuance by the Corporation of $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes on July 1, 2016 and an increase of $187.2 million of short-term borrowings, including $30.0 million acquired from Fox Chase. 
   
  Shareholders  Equity 
  The following table presents total shareholders  equity at the dates indicated: 

The increase in shareholder's equity at   September 30, 2016   of   $147.7 million   from December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the issuance of common stock of   $34.3 million   and additional paid-in capital of   $109.9 million   for the acquisition of Fox Chase. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by   $2.5 million   mainly attributable to increases in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities.  

Capital Adequacy 
  The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation s and the Bank s financial statements. Capital adequacy guidelines, and additionally for the Bank the prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined), or leverage ratio.  
    
  In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules revising the agencies  capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The new minimum capital requirements were effective on January 1, 2015. Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer requirements phase in over a four-year period beginning January 1, 2016. 
  The Corporation adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital rules during the first quarter of 2015 under the transition rules, primarily relating to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital, to be phased in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2015. Under Basel III rules, the decision was made to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. During 2016, the Corporation and the Bank must hold a capital  
  
   64 

     Table of Contents  

conservation buffer greater than .625% above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions. The regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank at   September 30, 2016   were well in excess of the regulatory minimum requirements including the capital conservation buffer requirements  .  

Table 4 Regulatory Capital 
  The Corporation's and Bank's actual and required capital ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 under BASEL III regulatory capital rules were as follows.  

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , management believes that the Corporation and the Bank continued to meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Corporation, like other bank holding companies, currently is required to maintain Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital equal to at least 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of total risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance-sheet items). The Bank, like other depository institutions, is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines. During 2016, the Corporation and the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than .625% of total risk-weighted assets in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions. For a depository institution to be considered  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios must be at least 8.0% and 10.0% on a risk-adjusted basis, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank is categorized as  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. The Corporation will continue to analyze the impact of the new rules as it grows and as the capital conservation buffer requirements are phased in.

Asset/Liability Management  
  The primary functions of Asset/Liability Management are to assure adequate earnings, capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of customers and corporate needs. Interest-rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing rates. 
  The Corporation uses both interest-sensitivity gap analysis and simulation modeling to quantify exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long-term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short-term rate exposures. The Corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one-year and two-year horizon. The simulation uses existing portfolio rate and re-pricing information, combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth, future spreads, prepayment speeds on loans, and the discretionary pricing of non-maturity assets and liabilities. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value.  

Liquidity 
  The Corporation, in its role as a financial intermediary, is exposed to certain liquidity risks. Liquidity refers to the Corporation s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. The Corporation manages liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. The Corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or a systemic financial crisis. 
  Sources of Funds 
  Core deposits and customer repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding sources for the Corporation. These deposits and repurchase agreements are primarily generated from a base of consumer, business and public customers primarily located in Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, Pennsylvania. The Corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mutual funds, security dealers and others. 
  The Corporation supplements its core funding with money market funds it holds for the benefit of various trust accounts. These funds are fully collateralized by the Bank s investment portfolio and bear interest at current money market mutual fund rates. This funding source is subject to changes in the asset allocations of the trust accounts. 
    
  The Corporation, through the Bank, has short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLB with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $  1.2 billion  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the principal amount of overnight and short-term borrowings with the FHLB were   $64.0 million   and   $0 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the principal amount of long-term borrowings with the FHLB were   $60.0 million   and   $0 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had outstanding short-term letters of credit with the FHLB totaling   $166.0 million   and   $170.2 million  , respectively, which were utilized to collateralize public funds deposits. The maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets as well as the FHLB s internal credit rating of the Bank, and the amount of funds received may be reduced by additional required purchases of FHLB stock. 
  The Corporation has a   $10.0 million   line of credit with a correspondent bank.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line. 
  The Corporation, through the Bank, maintains federal fund lines with several correspondent banks totaling   $302.0 million   and   $122.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Corporation had   $125.0 million   and   $0 million  , respectively, outstanding federal funds purchased with these correspondent banks. Future availability under these lines is subject to the prerogatives of the granting banks and may be withdrawn at will. 
  The Corporation, through the Bank, has an available line of credit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the amount of which is dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line.

Cash Requirements 
  The Corporation has cash requirements for various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments. The most significant contractual obligation, in both the under and over one year time period, is for the Bank to repay certificates of deposit and short-term and long-term borrowings. The Bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its financial center network, thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market. The Bank will also use borrowings and brokered deposits to meet its obligations. 
  Commitments to extend credit are the Bank s most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods. These commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. 
  Recent Accounting and Tax Legislation 
  For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.   
  On July 11, 2016 the Pennsylvania State General Assembly passed, and the Governor signed, amendments to the Tax Reform Code (TRC) providing revenues to support the new spending package. The TRC bill makes significant changes to the Bank Shares Tax (BST).  The final BST agreement includes a .95 percent rate (an increase of 6 basis points over the current .89 percent rate) with no retroactivity, as well as clarification language codified into law that allows both Method 1 and Method 2 receipts apportionment, and maintains the deductibility of goodwill. This will impact the Bank's Shares Tax recognized in 2017. Based on September 30, 2016 financial statements for the Bank, the 6 basis points increase in 2017 will cost approximately $400 thousand, or a negative impact to net income of $260 thousand.  
   
           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     No material changes in the Corporation s market risk or market strategy occurred during the current period. A detailed discussion of market risk is provided in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management is responsible for the disclosure controls and procedures of the Corporation. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be so disclosed by an issuer is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;

    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal controls over financial reporting.
