 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  
  Note 1 - Basis of Presentation of Interim Period Statements   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared by Barrett Business Services, Inc.
( BBSI , the  Company ,  our  or  we ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures typically included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated
financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from such estimates and assumptions. The condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K at pages F1   F62. The results of operations for an interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.     Revenue recognition   
 We recognize professional employer ( PEO ) service and staffing service revenue as services are rendered by our workforce. PEO
services are normally used by organizations to satisfy ongoing needs related to the management of human capital and are governed by the terms of a client services agreement which covers all employees at a particular work site. Our client services
agreements have a minimum term of one year, are renewable on an annual basis and typically require 30 days  written notice to cancel or terminate the contract by either party. In addition, our client services agreements provide for immediate
termination upon any default of the client regardless of when notice is given.   We report PEO revenues on a net basis because we are not
the primary obligor for the services provided by our clients to their customers pursuant to our client services agreements. We reduce these service fee revenues by the amounts invoiced to our clients for direct payroll expenses such as salaries,
wages, health insurance, employee out-of-pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment, and safety incentives. Safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain client companies for maintaining safe-work practices and minimizing
workplace injuries. The safety incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to clients who meet predetermined workers  compensation claims cost objectives.  
  Cost of revenues     Our cost of revenues
for staffing services includes direct payroll costs, employer payroll related taxes, employee benefits, and workers  compensation costs. Our cost of revenues for PEO services includes only employer payroll related taxes and workers 
compensation costs. Direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages. Payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of Social Security and Medicare
taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials, supplies and other expenses, which are paid by our customer. Workers  compensation costs consist primarily  
      9  

Table of Contents  

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation of Interim Period Statements (Continued)   

of the costs associated with our workers  compensation program, including claims reserves, claims administration fees, legal fees, medical cost containment ( MCC ) expense, state
administrative agency fees, third-party broker commissions, risk manager payroll, and excess insurance premiums for catastrophic injuries. We maintain separate workers  compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where the
Company is not self-insured, including California.     Cash and cash equivalents   
 We consider non-restricted short-term investments, which are highly liquid, readily convertible into cash, and have maturities at acquisition
of less than three months to be cash equivalents for purposes of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts that normally exceed FDIC insured
limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash concentration.     Investments   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investments consisted of municipal bonds and corporate bonds. We classify our investments as
trading or available-for-sale. The Company had no trading securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company classifies money market funds, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds as available for sale. They are reported at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity. Management considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of investments,
including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in other income (expense) as other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In the event a
loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, the loss will be recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.    Restricted cash and
investments     At September 30, 2016, restricted cash and investments consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S.
Treasuries, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds with maturities generally from 180 days to two years. At September 30, 2016, the approximate fair value of restricted cash and investments equaled their approximate amortized cost. Restricted
investments have been categorized as available-for-sale. They are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity. Management
considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of investments, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost. Realized gains and losses on sales of restricted investments are included in other income
(expense) as other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In the event a loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, the loss will be recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Allowance for doubtful accounts     The
Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $195,000 and $268,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable for services provided to our customers. Management
analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customers  payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the financial
condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

   Workers  compensation claims liabilities   
 Our workers  compensation claims liabilities do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather management s best
estimate, utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given reporting date. The estimated liability for open workers  compensation claims is based on an evaluation of information provided by our internal claims adjusters
and our third-party administrators for workers  compensation claims, coupled with an actuarial estimate of future adverse cost development with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims (together,
 IBNR ). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, workers  compensation claims liabilities included case reserve estimates for reported losses, plus additional amounts for estimated future adverse cost development of
IBNR claims, MCC and legal costs, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses, including future administrative fees to be paid to third-party service providers. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments to estimated
liabilities are reflected in current operating results as they become known.    The process of arriving at an estimate of unpaid claims and
claims adjustment expense involves a high degree of judgment and is affected by both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling practices, changes in reserve estimation procedures, changes in individuals involved in the
reserve estimation process, inflation, trends in the litigation and settlement of pending claims, and legislative changes.    Our estimates
are based on informed judgment, derived from individual experience and expertise applied to multiple sets of data and analyses. We consider significant facts and circumstances known both at the time that loss reserves are initially established and
as new facts and circumstances become known. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, the expenses incurred through final resolution of our liability for our workers  compensation claims will likely vary from the
related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, as specific claims are paid out in the future, actual paid losses may be materially different from our current loss reserves.  
 The Company s independent actuary provides management with an estimate of the current and long-term portions of our total workers 
compensation claims, which is an important factor in our process for estimating workers  compensation claims liabilities. The current portion represents the independent actuary s best estimate of payments the Company will make related to
workers  compensation claims over the ensuing twelve months. The Company will also pay out a portion of claims first incurred in the ensuing twelve months during that twelve-month period. The long-term portion represents the independent
actuary s best estimate of payments the Company will make related to workers  compensation claims more than twelve months in the future. 
 A basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that historical data and past patterns demonstrated in the incurred and paid historical data
form a reasonable basis upon which to project future outcomes, absent a material change. Significant structural changes to the available data can materially impact the reserve estimation process. To the extent a material change affecting
the ultimate claim liability becomes known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal Company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Nonetheless, actuaries exercise a considerable degree of
judgment in the evaluation of these factors and the need for such actuarial judgment is more pronounced when faced with material uncertainties.

   Safety incentives liability   
 Safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain PEO client companies for maintaining safe-work practices and minimizing workplace
injuries. The incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers  compensation claims cost objectives. Safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all
workers  compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period. The safety incentive liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon contract year-to-date payroll and the then current amount of the
customer s estimated workers  compensation claims reserves as established by us and our third-party administrator and the expected payout as determined by historical incentive payment trends. The Company provided $25.0 million and $21.3
million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as an estimate of the liability for unpaid safety incentives. Safety incentive costs are netted against PEO service revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations.    Statements of cash flows   
 Interest paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 did not materially differ from interest expense. Income taxes received
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively.     Basic and diluted earnings per share
    Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each year using the
treasury method. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential effects of the exercise of stock options and the payment of stock awards from other share-based compensation plans that are outstanding at the end of each period
presented. Basic and diluted shares outstanding are summarized as follows (in thousands):

   Accounting estimates   
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are used for fair value measurement of all investments, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, carrying values for goodwill and
property and equipment, accrued workers  compensation liabilities and safety incentive liabilities. Actual results may differ from such estimates.  
  Recent accounting pronouncements     In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 provide for a single,
principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is discussed in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10 Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-11 Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF
Meeting, and ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which all provide further clarification to be considered when implementing ASU 2014-09. The new guidance is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the date of the original effective date, for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company
plans to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2018 and is in the process of evaluating its planned transition method and the impact to its consolidated financial statements and disclosures of the adoption of ASU 2014-09.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest ( ASU 2015-03 ) to
simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The amendments in this accounting standard
update are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ( ASU 2015-07 ). ASU 2015-07 provides that investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value per share ( NAV ) must be
removed from the fair value hierarchy. Instead, those investments must be included as a reconciling line item so that the total fair value amount of investments in the disclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-07 also
includes disclosure requirements for investments for which the NAV practical expedient was used to determine fair value. The adoption of this guidance in the third quarter of 2016 did not impact our financial condition or results of operations.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU
2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance becomes effective for the Company beginning with our annual
report for the year ending December 31, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset
and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A
modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies the
accounting for the taxes related to stock-based compensation, including adjustments to how excess tax benefits and a company s payments for tax withholdings should be classified. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments.  ASU No. 2016-15 clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP, thereby reducing the current diversity in practice. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective
for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15 to the presentation of consolidated cash flows.

 In accordance with ASU 2015-07 (see Note 1), investments in money market funds measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient are not subject to hierarchy level classification disclosure. The
Company invests in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value. These investments include commingled funds that comprise high-quality short-term securities representing liquid debt and monetary instruments where the redemption
value is likely to be the fair value. Redemption is permitted daily without written notice.

   Note 3 - Workers  Compensation Claims   
 The following table summarizes the aggregate workers  compensation reserve activity (in thousands):  
   
   The states of California, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Delaware required us to maintain
specified investment balances or other financial instruments totaling $159.0 million at September 30, 2016 to cover potential workers  compensation claims losses related to the Company s current and former status as a self-insured
employer. In addition to restricted cash and investments held to satisfy these requirements at September 30, 2016, we have provided surety bonds and standby letters of credit totaling $152.9 million, including a California requirement of $147.2
million.    The Company also operates a wholly owned insurance company, Ecole Insurance Company ( Ecole ). Ecole is a fully
licensed insurance company holding a certificate of authority from the Arizona Department of Insurance. Ecole provides workers  compensation coverage to the Company s employees working in Arizona, Utah and Nevada. The surplus of Ecole was
$10.8 million and $9.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in long-term restricted cash and investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
 As part of its fronted workers  compensation insurance program with Chubb Limited ( Chubb , formerly ACE Group) in the states
of California, Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, the Company makes payments into a trust account ( the Chubb trust account ) to be used for the payment of future
claims. The balance in the Chubb trust account was $235.2 million and $166.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Chubb trust account balances are included as a component of the current and long-term restricted cash
and investments in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

   Note 3 - Workers  Compensation Claims (Continued)   
 At September 30, 2016 the Company recorded an asset of $13.2 million related to a payment remitted to Chubb on September 29, 2016 but not
deposited into the Chubb trust account until October 2016. This amount is included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.     Note 4
- Revolving Credit Facility and Long-Term Debt     The Company maintains a credit agreement (the  Agreement ) with its principal
bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the  Bank ). The Agreement provided for a $40.0 million term loan maturing December 31, 2016, as well as a $14.0 million revolving credit line, with a $6.0 million sublimit for unsecured
standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, the term loan has been paid off completely, compared to an outstanding balance of $15.0 million at December 31, 2015.  
 The Agreement also included $42.3 million in cash-secured letters of credit at September 30, 2016 to satisfy collateral requirements
associated with the Company s former status as a self-insured employer in California. In conjunction with these letters of credit, the Company posted with the Bank as collateral $44.1 million in restricted money market funds and restricted
certificates of deposit.    Advances under the revolving credit facility bear interest as selected by the Company of either (a) a daily
floating rate of one month LIBOR plus 2.0% or (b) a fixed rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%. The Agreement also provides for an unused commitment fee of 0.35% per year on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility, and a fee of
1.75% of the face amount of each letter of credit. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit line at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The revolving credit line expires on October 1, 2017.  
 The credit facility is collateralized by the Company s accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment, general intangibles and
equipment.    The Agreement requires the satisfaction of certain financial covenants as follows:  

minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of no less than 2.25:1.0, measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis, with Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio defined as (i) EBITDA (net profit before taxes plus interest expense,
net of capitalized interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense) minus distributions, dividends and cash taxes paid, divided by (ii) $9,425,000. Prior to September 30, 2016, the minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was no less than
1.50:1.0, measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis.        

ratio of restricted and unrestricted cash and investments to workers  compensation and safety incentive liabilities of at least 1.0:1.0, measured quarterly.    
 The Agreement includes certain additional restrictions as follows:      

capital expenditures may not exceed a total of $4.0 million in 2016 without the Bank s prior approval;    
      18  

Table of Contents  

Note 4 - Revolving Credit Facility and Long-Term Debt (Continued)   

incurring additional indebtedness is prohibited without the prior approval of the Bank, other than up to $200,000 per year in purchase money financing and the aggregate of all purchase money indebtedness may not exceed
$400,000 at any time;        

repurchases of the Company s common stock are prohibited.        

quarterly cash dividends up to $0.22 per share may be paid so long as there is no default by the Company and payment would not cause a default; and    

delisting of the Company s common stock by The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) is an event of default.    
 The Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Agreement occurs and is continuing, the Bank
may declare any outstanding obligations under the Agreement to be immediately due and payable.    At September 30, 2016, the Company was in
violation of the capital expenditure restriction. The Bank agreed to waive this covenant violation.    The Company maintains a mortgage loan
with the Bank with a balance of approximately $4.7 million and $4.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, secured by the Company s corporate office building in Vancouver, Washington. This loan requires payment
of monthly principal payments of $18,375 plus interest at a rate of one month LIBOR plus 2.25%, with the unpaid principal balance due November 1, 2017.  
  Note 5 - Income Taxes     Under ASC 740,
 Income Taxes,  management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis under a  more-likely than not  standard. As part of this evaluation, management reviews all evidence both positive and
negative to determine if a valuation allowance is needed. One component of this analysis is to determine whether the Company was in a cumulative loss position for the most recent 12 quarters. The Company was in a cumulative income position
for the 12 quarters ended September 30, 2016. Based on management s analysis, no valuation allowance of deferred tax assets was recorded at September 30, 2016.  
 The Internal Revenue Service is examining the Company s federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

   Note 6 - Litigation   
 On November 6, 2014, plaintiffs in  Michael Arciaga, et al. v. Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al. , filed an action in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Washington against BBSI, Michael L. Elich, BBSI s Chief Executive Officer, and James D. Miller, BBSI s then Chief Financial Officer. The action purported to be a class action brought
on behalf of all BBSI shareholders alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The claims arose from the decline in the market price for BBSI common stock following announcement of a charge for increased workers  compensation
reserves expense. The lawsuit sought compensatory damages, plus interest, and costs and expenses (including attorney fees and expert fees).  
 On November 13, 2014, a second purported shareholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Washington, entitled  Christopher     P. Carnes, et al. v. Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al . The  Carnes  complaint named the same defendants as the  Arciaga  case and asserted similar claims for relief.
   Similarly, on November 17, 2014, a third purported shareholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, entitled  Shiva Stein, et al. v. Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al.  The  Stein  complaint named the same defendants as the  Arciaga  and  Carnes  cases and asserted similar claims for
relief.    On February 25, 2015, the court ordered consolidation of the three cases, and any new or other cases involving the same subject
matter, into a single action for pretrial purposes. The consolidated cases were recaptioned as  In re Barrett Business Services Securities Litigation.  The court also appointed the Painters   Allied Trades District Council No. 35
Pension and Annuity Funds as the lead plaintiff.    On March 21, 2016, before the court had ruled on the defendants  motion to dismiss
the plaintiffs  first amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, naming the same defendants. The second amended consolidated complaint dropped certain allegations from the first amended
complaint and added new allegations relating to disclosures in BBSI s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 9, 2016. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint on May 23, 2016.  
 On October 26, 2016, before the court ruled on the motion to dismiss, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement dated
as of October 26, 2016 (the  Settlement ), to settle the litigation. The settlement class includes all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired BBSI common stock in the period beginning February 12, 2013, through March
9, 2016, and were damaged thereby, with certain exclusions.    The Settlement is intended to fully, finally and forever compromise, settle,
release, resolve, and dismiss with prejudice the purported class action and all claims asserted therein against the named defendants. In the Settlement, the defendants have denied all allegations of wrongdoing and the plaintiffs have not
conceded any infirmities in their positions.  
      20  

Table of Contents  

Note 6   Litigation (Continued)   
   
  The Settlement calls for the payment in cash of $12.0 million (the  Settlement
Fund ) into escrow by November 29, 2016, which is 15 business days after the court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement. Of this amount, approximately $8.7 million will be paid by BBSI s insurance carriers and
approximately $3.3 million will be paid by BBSI. The amount to be paid by BBSI has been accrued at September 30, 2016 and is included in other accrued liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fees of counsel for the plaintiffs
will be paid out of the Settlement Fund following approval by the court.    The Settlement is subject to approval by the court and to other
customary terms and conditions, including the right of BBSI to terminate the Settlement under specified circumstances. All potential class members will be notified of the Settlement in November 2016. The court has scheduled a hearing for
February 22, 2017, to consider final approval of the Settlement. If the Settlement is not approved by the court, or is otherwise terminated before it is finalized, BBSI is unable to predict the final outcome of the litigation or to estimate its
effect on BBSI, which may be material and adverse.   BBSI received a subpoena from the San Francisco office of the Division of Enforcement
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) in May 2015 in connection with the SEC s investigation of BBSI s accounting practices with regard to its workers  compensation reserves. In April 2016, the SEC
issued a second subpoena to BBSI for documents relating to the disclosures made by BBSI following Mr. Miller s termination. BBSI was also advised by the United States Department of Justice in mid-June 2016 that it has commenced an
investigation. BBSI is cooperating fully with the investigations.    On June 17, 2015, Daniel Salinas ( Salinas ) filed a
shareholder derivative lawsuit against BBSI and certain of its officers and directors in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and other violations of law and seeks
recovery of various damages, including the costs and expenses incurred in connection with BBSI s reserve strengthening process, reserve study and consultants, the cost of stock repurchases by BBSI in October 2014, compensation paid to
BBSI s officers, and costs of negotiating BBSI s credit facility with its principal lender, as well as the proceeds of sales of stock by certain of BBSI s officers and directors during 2013 and 2014. On September 28, 2015, BBSI
and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the derivative suit and a motion to stay pending resolution of  In re Barrett Business Services Securities Litigation . On December 4, 2015, Salinas filed an opposition to each
motion. On January 27, 2016, the defendants filed a reply to the opposition brief. On February 11, 2016, Judge Michel Pierson heard oral argument on the motions. A decision has not been issued.  
 Management is unable to estimate the probability, or the potential range of loss arising from the legal actions described above.  
 BBSI is subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management,
the amount of ultimate liability with respect to other currently pending or threatened actions is not expected to materially affect BBSI s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        General
     Company Background . Barrett Business Services, Inc. ( BBSI,  the  Company,   our  or
 we ), is a leading provider of business management solutions for small and mid-sized companies. The Company has developed a management platform that integrates a knowledge-based approach from the management consulting industry with
tools from the human resource outsourcing industry. This platform, through the effective leveraging of human capital, helps our business owner clients run their businesses more effectively. We believe this platform, delivered through a
decentralized organizational structure, differentiates BBSI from our competitors. BBSI was incorporated in Maryland in 1965.  
  Business Strategy . Our strategy is to align local operations teams with the mission of small and mid-sized business owners,
driving value to their business. To do so, BBSI:      

partners with business owners to leverage their investment in human capital through a high-touch, results-oriented approach;        

brings predictability to each client organization through a three-tiered management platform; and        

enables business owners to focus on their core business by reducing organizational complexity and maximizing productivity.    
  Business Organization . We operate a decentralized delivery model using operationally-focused business teams, typically located
within 50 miles of our client companies. These teams are led by senior level business generalists and comprise senior level professionals with expertise in human resources, organizational development, risk mitigation and workplace safety and
various types of administration, including payroll. These teams are responsible for growth of their operations and for providing strategic leadership, guidance and expert consultation to our client companies. The decentralized structure fosters
autonomous decision-making in which business teams deliver plans that closely align with the objectives of each business owner client. This structure also provides a means of incubating talent to support increased growth and capacity. We
support clients with employees located in 22 states and the District of Columbia through a network of 55 branch locations in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia. We
also have several smaller recruiting locations in our general market areas, which are under the direction of a branch office.

  BBSI believes that making significant investments in the best talent available allows us to
leverage the value of this investment many times over. We motivate our management employees through a compensation package that includes a competitive base salary and the opportunity for profit sharing. At the branch level, profit sharing
is in direct correlation to client performance, reinforcing a culture focused on achievement of client goals.     Services
Overview . BBSI s core purpose is to advocate for business owners, particularly in the small and mid-sized business segment. Our evolution from an entrepreneurially run company to a professionally managed organization has helped
inform our view that all businesses experience inflection points at key stages of growth. The insights gained through our own growth, along with the trends we see in working with more than 4,100 companies each day, define our approach to
guiding business owners through the challenges associated with being an employer. BBSI s business teams align with each business owner client through a structured three-tiered progression. In doing so, business teams focus on the
objectives of each business owner and deliver planning, guidance and resources in support of those objectives.     Tier 1: Tactical Alignment   
 The first stage focuses on the mutual setting of expectations and is essential to a successful client relationship. It begins with a
process of assessment and discovery in which the business owner s business objectives, attitudes, and culture are aligned with BBSI s processes, controls and culture. This stage includes an implementation process, which addresses the
administrative components of employment.    Tier 2: Dynamic Relationship   
 The second stage of the relationship emphasizes organizational development as a means of achieving each client s business objectives.
There is a focus on process improvement, development of best practices, supervisor training and leadership development.     Tier 3: Strategic Counsel
    With an emphasis on advocacy on behalf of the business owner, the third stage of the relationship is more strategic and
forward-looking with a goal of cultivating an environment in which all efforts are directed by the mission and long-term objectives of the business owner.  
 In addition to serving as a resource and guide, BBSI has the ability to provide workers  compensation coverage as a means of meeting
statutory requirements and protecting our clients from employment-related injury claims. Through our internal claims managers and our third-party administrators, we provide claims management services for our clients. We work aggressively
to manage and reduce job injury claims, identify fraudulent claims and structure optimal work programs, including modified duty.

   Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by selected items in the Company s Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
   We report professional employer service revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the
services provided by our co-employed clients to their customers pursuant to our client service agreements. We present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 in the table below. Although not in accordance with GAAP, management believes this information is informative as to the level of our business activity and illustrative of how we manage our operations, including the preparation of
our internal operating forecasts, because it presents our professional employer services on a basis comparable to our staffing services.  
 The presentation of revenues on a net basis and the relative contributions of staffing and professional employer services revenues can create
volatility in our gross margin percentage. The general impact of fluctuations in our revenue mix is described below.      

A relative increase in professional employer services revenue will result in higher gross margin percentage. Improvement in gross margin percentage occurs because incremental client service revenue dollars are
reported as revenue net of all related direct payroll and safety incentive costs.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)         

A relative increase in staffing revenues will typically result in a lower gross margin percentage. Staffing revenues are presented at gross with the related direct costs reported in cost of revenues. While
staffing relationships typically have higher margins than professional employer service relationships, an increase in staffing revenues and related costs increases the impact of the net professional employer services revenue on gross margin
percentage.        
   A reconciliation of net revenue to non-GAAP gross revenues is as follows for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

   The non-GAAP adjustments comprise direct payroll costs and safety incentives attributable to our professional
employer services client companies.      Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 Net income for the third quarter of 2016 amounted to $10.2 million compared to net income of $11.0 million for the third quarter of
2015. Diluted income per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.38 compared to diluted income per share of $1.49 for 2015. 
 Revenues for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $225.1 million, an increase of approximately $26.4 million or 13.3% over the third quarter of
2015, which reflects an increase in the Company s professional employer service fee revenue of $25.1 million or 16.5%, and an increase in staffing services revenue of $1.3 million or 2.7%. 
 Approximately 78% and 77%, respectively, of our total net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 was attributable to our
California operations.    Our growth in professional employer service revenues was attributable to both new and existing customers. Due to
continued strength in our referral channels, business from new customers during the third quarter of 2016 nearly doubled business lost from former customers. Professional employer service revenue from continuing customers reflected a 9.1%
increase compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily resulting from increases in employee headcount and hours worked. The increase in staffing services revenue was due primarily to an increase in new staffing business.

  Gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 totaled approximately $49.6 million or 22.0% of
revenue compared to $42.9 million or 21.6% of revenue for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in direct payroll costs along with payroll taxes and benefits, as a percentage of
revenues, partially offset by an increase in workers  compensation expense, as a percentage of revenues.   Direct payroll costs for the
third quarter of 2016 totaled approximately $37.0 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $35.3 million or 17.8% of revenue for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in direct payroll costs percentage was primarily due to the increase in
professional employer services and the decrease of staffing services within the mix of our customer base compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
 Payroll taxes and benefits for the third quarter of 2016 totaled approximately $82.9 million or 36.8% of revenue compared to $75.2 million or
37.8% of revenue for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in payroll taxes and benefits percentage was due to a $3.8 million federal unemployment tax credit recognized in the third quarter of 2016. This included $2.9 million for tax years
2013, 2014 and 2015. Adjusting for this credit, payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of revenues was 38.5% in the third quarter of 2016. This increase is in line with the growth in professional employer services where payroll taxes and
benefits are presented at gross cost.    Workers  compensation expense for the third quarter of 2016 totaled approximately $55.6
million or 24.7% of revenue compared to $45.3 million or 22.8% of revenue for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in workers  compensation expense percentage was primarily due to an increase in current period claims expense from $29.7
million in the third quarter of 2015 to $38.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, coupled with a reduction in prior periods claims expense of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a reduction of $1.0 million in the third quarter of
2016.    Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled approximately $30.4
million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $25.4 million or 12.8% of revenue for the third quarter of 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to $1.7 million in legal and accounting costs associated with financial
restatements, outside investigations and legal proceedings related to securities law issues.    Other expense, net for the third quarter of
2016 totaled approximately $3.3 million as compared to an expense of $216,000 for the third quarter of 2015. The change was attributable to a $3.3 million litigation settlement.  
 Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 31.9%, compared to 33.5% for the third quarter of 2015. Our income tax
rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to federal and state tax credits.

    Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $10.8 million compared to a net income of $14.0 million for the first nine
months of 2015. Diluted income per share for the first nine months of 2016 was $1.46 compared to diluted income per share of $1.91 for 2015. 
 Revenues for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $619.5 million, an increase of approximately $72.4 million or 13.2% over the similar period
of 2015, which reflects an increase in the Company s professional employer service fee revenue of $78.7 million or 18.8%, offset by a decrease in staffing services revenue of $6.3 million or 4.9%.  
 Approximately 78% of our total net revenues during the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was attributable to our California
operations.    Our growth in professional employer service revenues was attributable to both new and existing customers. Due to continued
strength in our referral channels, business from new customers during the first nine months of 2016 nearly doubled business lost from former customers. Professional employer service revenue from continuing customers reflected an 8.1% increase
compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily resulting from increases in employee headcount and hours worked. The decrease in staffing services revenue was due primarily to a decrease in net staffing business as lost business from
former customers exceeded the addition of new business, coupled with a decrease in revenue from continuing customers.    Gross margin for
the first nine months of 2016 totaled approximately $102.2 million or 16.5% of revenue compared to $88.3 million or 16.1% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in direct
payroll costs as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by increases in workers  compensation expense and payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of revenues. 
 Direct payroll costs for the first nine months of 2016 totaled approximately $92.7 million or 15.0% of revenue compared to $97.3 million or
17.8% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in direct payroll costs percentage was primarily due to the increase in professional employer services and the decrease of staffing services within the mix of our customer base
compared to the first nine months of 2015.   Payroll taxes and benefits for the first nine months of 2016 totaled approximately $269.5
million or 43.5% of revenue compared to $235.1 million or 43.0% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in payroll taxes and benefits percentage was primarily due to the effect of growth in professional employer services,
where payroll taxes and benefits are presented at gross cost. The effect of the growth in professional employer services on payroll taxes and benefits was partially offset by a $3.8 million federal unemployment tax credit recognized in the third
quarter of 2016.

    Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (Continued)    
   
  Workers  compensation expense for the first nine months of 2016 totaled approximately
$155.1 million or 25.0% of revenue compared to $126.4 million or 23.1% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in workers  compensation expense percentage was primarily due to the reduction in prior periods  claims
expense of $9.7 million in the first nine months of 2015 compared to a reduction of $1.5 million in the first nine months of 2016, coupled with an increase in current period claims expense from $84.9 million in the first nine months of 2015 to
$103.9 million in the first nine months of 2016.    SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $80.8 million, or 13.0% of
revenue compared to $63.8 million or 11.7% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. A portion of the increase was due to $6.1 million in legal and accounting costs associated with financial restatements, outside investigations and legal
proceedings related to securities law issues.    Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $3.3
million as compared to $1.1 million for the first nine months of 2015. The change was attributable to a $3.3 million litigation settlement recognized in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by a decline in interest expense and an increase in
investment income.    Our effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 31.7%, compared to 34.0% for the first nine months
of 2015. Our income tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to federal and state tax credits. 
  Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results   
 We have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, including losses in the first quarter of each
year, and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality, wage limits on statutory payroll taxes, claims experience for workers  compensation, demand
for our services and competition. Payroll taxes, as a component of cost of revenues, generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and Social Security taxes are exceeded
on a per employee basis. Our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers  businesses in the agriculture, food processing and forest products-related
industries. In addition, revenues in the fourth quarter may be reduced by many customers  practice of operating on holiday-shortened schedules. Workers  compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of
workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims. In addition, adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the
Company s estimated workers  compensation expense.

 The Company s cash position of $26.8 million at September 30, 2016 increased $1.6 million from December 31, 2015, compared to an
increase of $5.3 million for the comparable period of 2015. The increase in cash at September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, was primarily due to net income of $10.8 million, proceeds from securities of $95.6 million, an increase in
accrued payroll, payroll taxes and related benefits of $39.7 million and an increase in workers  compensation claims liabilities of $36.3 million, partially offset by purchases of securities of $127.5 million and an increase in trade accounts
receivable of $49.5 million.    Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $57.3
million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $51.3 million for the comparable period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flow was primarily due to net income of $10.8 million, an increase in accrued
payroll, payroll taxes and related benefits of $39.7 million and an increase in workers  compensation claims liabilities of $36.3 million, partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable of $49.5 million.  
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled $35.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used of
$31.3 million for the comparable period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of restricted cash and investments of $127.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from
sales and maturities of restricted cash and investments of $91.1 million.    Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $20.0 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $14.6 million for the comparable period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash was primarily used for debt payments of $15.2 million
and dividend payments of $4.8 million.   The states of California, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Delaware required us to
maintain specified investment balances or other financial instruments totaling $159.0 million at September 30, 2016 to cover potential workers  compensation claims losses related to the Company s current and former status as a self-insured
employer. In addition to restricted cash and investments held to satisfy these requirements at September 30, 2016, we have provided surety bonds and standby letters of credit totaling $152.9 million, including a California requirement of $147.2
million.    Due to a decrease in our California workers  compensation claims liability during the first nine months of 2016, the surety
insurers decreased their letter of credit requirement to $42.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $88.3 million at December 31, 2015. The collateral associated with the letters of credit decreased to $44.1 million at September 30, 2016
from $92.4 million at December 31, 2015.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)         
  Management expects the letters of credit and related collateral to decrease over time as a
result of a declining self-insured liability in California. The Company s self-insured status in California ended on December 31, 2014. 
 Ecole, our wholly owned insurance company, provides workers  compensation coverage to the Company s employees working in Arizona,
Utah and Nevada. The surplus of Ecole was $10.8 million and $9.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in long-term restricted cash and investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
 As part of the Chubb fronted workers  compensation insurance program, the Company makes monthly payments into the Chubb trust account, to
be used for the payment of future claims. The balance in the Chubb trust account was $235.2 million and $166.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Chubb trust account balance is made up of money market
funds, included as a component of the current and long-term restricted cash and investments in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  
 At September 30, 2016 the Company recorded an asset of $13.2 million related to a payment remitted to Chubb on September 29, 2016 but not
deposited into the Chubb trust account until October 2016. This amount is included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and is included in cash used in investing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows.    The Company maintains a credit agreement (the  Agreement ) with its principal bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the  Bank ). The Agreement provided for a $40.0 million term loan maturing December 31, 2016, as well as a $14.0 million revolving credit line, with a $6.0 million sublimit for unsecured standby letters of credit. As
of September 30, 2016, the term loan has been paid off completely, compared to an outstanding balance of $15.0 million at December 31, 2015.  
 The Agreement also included $42.3 million in cash-secured letters of credit at September 30, 2016 to satisfy collateral requirements
associated with the Company s former status as a self-insured employer in California. In conjunction with these letters of credit, the Company posted with the Bank as collateral $44.1 million in restricted money market funds and restricted
certificates of deposit.    Advances under the revolving credit facility bear interest as selected by the Company of either (a) a daily
floating rate of one month LIBOR plus 2.0% or (b) a fixed rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%. The Agreement also provides for an unused commitment fee of 0.35% per year on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility, and a fee of
1.75% of the face amount of each letter of credit. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit line at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The revolving line of credit expires on October 1, 2017.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)         
  The credit facility is collateralized by the Company s accounts receivable and other
rights to receive payment, general intangibles and equipment.    The Agreement requires the satisfaction of certain financial covenants as
follows:      

minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of no less than 2.25:1.0, measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis, with Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio defined as (i) EBITDA (net profit before taxes plus interest expense,
net of capitalized interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense) minus distributions, dividends and cash taxes paid, divided by (ii) $9,425,000. Prior to June 30, 2016, the minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was no less than
1.50:1.0, measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis.        

ratio of restricted and unrestricted cash and investments to workers  compensation and safety incentive liabilities of at least 1.0:1.0, measured quarterly.    
 The Agreement includes certain additional restrictions as follows:      

capital expenditures may not exceed a total of $4.0 million in 2016 without the Bank s prior approval;        

incurring additional indebtedness is prohibited without the prior approval of the Bank, other than up to $200,000 per year in purchase money financing and the aggregate of all purchase money indebtedness may not exceed
$400,000 at any time;        

repurchases of the Company s common stock are prohibited.        

quarterly cash dividends up to $0.22 per share may be paid so long as there is no default by the Company and payment would not cause a default; and    

delisting of the Company s common stock by The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) is an event of default.    
 The Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Agreement occurs and is continuing, the Bank
may declare any outstanding obligations under the Agreement to be immediately due and payable.   At September 30, 2016, the Company was in
violation of the capital expenditure restriction. The Bank agreed to waive this covenant violation.    The Company maintains a mortgage loan
with the Bank with a balance of approximately $4.7 million and $4.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, secured by the Company s corporate office building in Vancouver, Washington. This loan requires payment
of monthly installments of $18,375, bearing interest at the one month LIBOR plus 2.25%, with the unpaid principal balance due November 1, 2017.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)         
  The Company is self-insured for certain business insurance risks such as general liability,
errors and omissions and umbrella coverage. Management may explore in the future whether to pursue other vehicles to provide coverage including coverages provided by the Company s captive insurance companies.  
 Management expects that the funds anticipated to be generated from operations, current liquid assets, and availability under the
Company s revolving credit facility will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the Company s working capital needs for the next twelve months.  
  Inflation     Inflation generally has not
been a significant factor in the Company s operations during the periods discussed above. The Company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for workers 
compensation claims.     Forward-Looking Information

forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.      

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       The Company s exposure
to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio of liquid assets and its outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and long-term debt. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investments consisted
principally of approximately $274.0 million in money market funds, $11.8 million in certificates of deposit, $5.3 million in U.S. Treasuries, $4.0 million in corporate bonds, and $3.6 million in municipal bonds. The Company s outstanding
long-term debt totaled approximately $4.4 million at September 30, 2016. Based on the Company s overall interest exposure at September 30, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the
fair value of the Company s investment portfolio of liquid assets, its outstanding borrowings or its results of operations because of the predominantly short maturities of the securities within the investment portfolio and the relative size of
the outstanding borrowings.      

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining for our Company adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.    We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  that are designed with
the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer
( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures (Continued)         
  Based on their evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2016 because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
( ICFR ) described below.     Previously Identified Material Weaknesses   
 As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, management identified the following material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:      

1) 
 The control environment, which includes the Company s Code of Business Conduct, is the responsibility of senior management and the Company s Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors (the
 Audit Committee ), sets the tone of our organization, influences the control consciousness of employees and is the foundation for the other components of ICFR. On March 3, 2016, the Audit Committee met with James D. Miller, the
Company s then CFO. Mr. Miller reported that he had made unsupported journal entries in the Company s financial records in circumvention of the Company s ICFR. Based on information provided by Mr. Miller and additional
investigation undertaken at the direction of the Audit Committee, the primary effect of the unsupported, non-GAAP journal entries, confirmed as such through the investigation, was the understatement of workers  compensation expense and
overstatement of payroll taxes and benefits expense during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Following these events, the Company determined that the former CFO did not promote an attitude of integrity and control consciousness,
leading to insufficient attention to his responsibilities and the Company s ICFR. As a result of the actions of the former CFO, we have determined that our management review controls were not operating effectively, leading to additional
material weaknesses as noted below. Further, effective mitigating controls were not in place elsewhere among senior management or the Board of Directors to discourage, prevent or detect management override of internal controls related to the
Company s financial reporting process.        

2) 
 The Company did not maintain effective internal control over the process for deriving accounting estimates related to workers  compensation expense. Specifically, the Company did not ensure appropriate review
of the data provided to its actuary or the analysis underlying actuarial reports provided by the actuary. As a result of this control deficiency, the Company failed to detect on a timely basis errors in its workers  compensation expense
with respect to MCC fees incurred for the administration of workers  compensation claims, unallocated loss adjustment expense, and costs related to development of prior period claims.    

3) 
 The Company did not maintain effective internal control over the review, approval, and documentation of journal entries. Specifically, the Company failed to detect on a timely basis the recording of unsupported journal
entries in the Company s books and records relating primarily to payroll taxes and benefits and workers  compensation expense.        

4) 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective internal control over account reconciliation procedures related to workers  compensation accruals. As a result of this deficiency, the Company failed to detect
on a timely basis errors related to workers  compensation liability and workers  compensation expense.    
      35  

Table of Contents  

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures (Continued)         

5) 
 The Company did not maintain effective internal controls related to its information and technology systems. Specifically the Company did not maintain effective controls over program changes and access to programs
and data, and mitigating controls were ineffective.        

6) 
 The Company did not maintain effective internal control over the review of payroll tax accruals and payroll tax expense, allowing for management override of controls. As a result of this deficiency, the Company failed
to detect on a timely basis errors in the calculation of its federal and state payroll tax accruals and payroll tax expense.       Plan for
Remediation of Material Weaknesses and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     The Company s Board of Directors,
Audit Committee, and management are actively engaged in the planning for and implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified above. The following actions have been taken to address the material weaknesses:

Terminated the employment of the former CFO following his report to the Audit Committee regarding his actions in recording unsupported journal entries in the Company s financial records.    

The Audit Committee engaged an independent public accounting firm to perform a forensic accounting investigation for the period from January 1, 2009, through March 31, 2016. This investigation has been completed.

Hired a permanent CFO and new Controller and Assistant Controller with meaningful industry, public company accounting and financial experience.    

The Board of Directors increased the number of positions on the Board from six to seven and appointed an individual with extensive financial management and public company experience to fill the new vacancy. Having met
all applicable financial literacy and independence requirements, this individual was appointed to serve as a member of the Audit Committee and as the Audit Committee financial expert. The Board of Directors is continuing their search for an
additional individual to add in the ensuing months.        

Directed the Audit Committee to ensure timely review by the Audit Committee of all engagements entered into by management relating to actuaries, specialists or other professionals whose consulting work could have an
impact on the Company s financial reporting.        

Established a Workers  Compensation Committee ( WCC ) consisting of the Chief Operating Officer   Corporate Operations, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller and Director of Insurance to
oversee the Company s controls and procedures related to workers  compensation claims administration and expense and its process for developing reserve estimates, as well as to participate in substantive communications with the
Company s independent actuary with regard to the Company s reserve for workers  compensation liabilities.    
      36  

Table of Contents  

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures (Continued)         

Established a procedure for quarterly meetings of the WCC with the Company s independent actuary with the goal of ensuring that the actuary is fully informed and has a complete understanding of the components
included in the payroll and workers  compensation claims data provided to the actuary by the Company and to examine fully the quarterly actuarial report produced by the actuary. Meetings occurred in April, July, and October 2016.

Directed the Company s CFO to implement a process of regular communication with the Audit Committee regarding management initiatives that may have a material effect on the Company s financial statements or
involve material changes in the Company s accounting practices or ICFR.        

Met with members of the Company s accounting staff to ensure their understanding of the requirements and importance of the Company s Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, a specific section of the
Company s Code of Business Conduct.        

Retained an outside third-party expert to provide an in-depth education and training for all BBSI accounting staff and other relevant personnel regarding the disclosure and financial records requirements of the federal
securities laws applicable to public companies, and the requirements and significance of the Company s Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers.        

Engaged a Big 4 public accounting firm to conduct training for all BBSI accounting staff and other relevant personnel on the requirements and importance of ICFR, including risk assessment, internal control design and
control performer responsibilities.        

Implemented a process of regular communication by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and executive officers to all employees regarding the ethical values of the Company and the requirement on the part of all
directors, officers, and employees to comply with applicable law, the Company s Code of Business Conduct, and the Company s accounting policies and ICFR. As an initial step, the CEO distributed a written communication companywide
reiterating the Company s focus on honesty and integrity, establishing at the Director level a designated liaison at the Company who employees may contact to discuss a potential ethical issue and reminding employees of their ability to report
concerns anonymously through the Company s whistleblower hotline in place since 2004. The Company s new permanent CFO distributed an additional written communication companywide after his arrival reiterating these themes and also reminding
employees of the Company s whistleblower hotline.        

Increased and enhanced resources within the accounting and finance group to address standardization of processes, training regarding critical accounting policies affecting the Company and development of competencies and
understanding of relevant accounting policies and ICFR.        

Engaged a Big 4 public accounting firm to assist management with assessing and enhancing the Company s control environment. The engagement is currently in progress and includes performing a risk assessment and
evaluating the design of controls related to:        

The determination of certain accounting estimates, and in particular, appropriate review of the inputs and data used in the formulation of the estimates, including data provided to actuaries, review of actuarial
reports, and review, approval and application of appropriate GAAP for transactions and accounting methodology changes.    
      37  

Table of Contents  

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures (Continued)         

Manual journal entries, including implementation of new controls over the review, approval and recording of manual journal entries to ensure that manual journal entries recorded in the financial records are properly
prepared, supported by adequate documentation, and independently reviewed and approved.       

Effective and timely reconciliations of balance sheet accounts.        

Restrictions on access to and segregation of duties within the Company s information and technology systems.        

Implementation of improvements to the Company s information and technology systems.    
 Management believes the measures described above will remediate the identified material weaknesses in future periods. As it continues to
evaluate and improve ICFR, management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or to modify certain of the remediation measures described above.  
  Inherent Limitations     Control systems, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems  objectives are being met. Further, the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Control systems can
also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the
degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

    PART II-OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       On November 6, 2014, plaintiffs in  Michael Arciaga, et al. v.
Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al. , filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against BBSI, Michael L. Elich, BBSI s Chief Executive Officer, and James D. Miller, BBSI s then Chief
Financial Officer. The action purported to be a class action brought on behalf of all BBSI shareholders alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The claims arose from the decline in the market price for BBSI common stock
following announcement of a charge for increased workers  compensation reserves expense. The lawsuit sought compensatory damages, plus interest, and costs and expenses (including attorney fees and expert fees).  
 On November 13, 2014, a second purported shareholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Washington, entitled  Christopher     P. Carnes, et al. v. Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al . The  Carnes  complaint named the same defendants as the  Arciaga  case and asserted similar claims for relief.
   Similarly, on November 17, 2014, a third purported shareholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, entitled  Shiva Stein, et al. v. Barrett Business Services, Inc., et al.  The  Stein  complaint named the same defendants as the  Arciaga  and  Carnes  cases and asserted similar claims for
relief.    On February 25, 2015, the court ordered consolidation of the three cases, and any new or other cases involving the same subject
matter, into a single action for pretrial purposes. The consolidated cases were recaptioned as  In re Barrett Business Services Securities Litigation.  The court also appointed the Painters   Allied Trades District Council No. 35
Pension and Annuity Funds as the lead plaintiff.    On March 21, 2016, before the court had ruled on the defendants  motion to dismiss
the plaintiffs  first amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, naming the same defendants. The second amended consolidated complaint dropped certain allegations from the first amended
complaint and added new allegations relating to disclosures in BBSI s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 9, 2016. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint on May 23, 2016.  
 On October 26, 2016, before the court ruled on the motion to dismiss, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement dated
as of October 26, 2016 (the  Settlement ), to settle the litigation. The settlement class includes all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired BBSI common stock in the period beginning February 12, 2013, through
March 9, 2016, and were damaged thereby, with certain exclusions.    The Settlement is intended to fully, finally and forever
compromise, settle, release, resolve, and dismiss with prejudice the purported class action and all claims asserted therein against the named defendants. In the Settlement, the defendants have denied all allegations of wrongdoing and the
plaintiffs have not conceded any infirmities in their positions.  
      39  

Table of Contents  

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings (Continued)         
  The Settlement calls for the payment in cash of $12.0 million (the  Settlement
Fund ) into escrow by November 29, 2016, which is 15 business days after the court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement. Of this amount, approximately $8.7 million will be paid by BBSI s insurance carriers and
approximately $3.3 million will be paid by BBSI. The amount to be paid by BBSI has been accrued at September 30, 2016 and is included in other accrued liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fees of counsel for the
plaintiffs will be paid out of the Settlement Fund following approval by the court.    The Settlement is subject to approval by the court
and to other customary terms and conditions, including the right of BBSI to terminate the Settlement under specified circumstances. All potential class members will be notified of the Settlement in November 2016. The court has scheduled a hearing
for February 22, 2017, to consider final approval of the Settlement. If the Settlement is not approved by the court, or is otherwise terminated before it is finalized, BBSI is unable to predict the final outcome of the litigation or to estimate its
effect on BBSI, which may be material and adverse.   BBSI received a subpoena from the San Francisco office of the Division of Enforcement
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) in May 2015 in connection with the SEC s investigation of BBSI s accounting practices with regard to its workers  compensation reserves. In April 2016, the SEC issued a
second subpoena to BBSI for documents relating to the disclosures made by BBSI following Mr. Miller s termination. BBSI was also advised by the United States Department of Justice in  mid-June  2016 that it
has commenced an investigation. BBSI is cooperating fully with the investigations.    On June 17, 2015, Daniel Salinas ( Salinas )
filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against BBSI and certain of its officers and directors in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and other violations of law and
seeks recovery of various damages, including the costs and expenses incurred in connection with BBSI s reserve strengthening process, reserve study and consultants, the cost of stock repurchases by BBSI in October 2014, compensation paid to
BBSI s officers, and costs of negotiating BBSI s credit facility with its principal lender, as well as the proceeds of sales of stock by certain of BBSI s officers and directors during 2013 and 2014. On September 28, 2015, BBSI
and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the derivative suit and a motion to stay pending resolution of  In re Barrett Business Services Securities Litigation . On December 4, 2015, Salinas filed an opposition to each
motion. On January 27, 2016, the defendants filed a reply to the opposition brief. On February 11, 2016, Judge Michel Pierson heard oral argument on the motions. A decision has not been issued.  
 Management is unable to estimate the probability, or the potential range of loss arising from the legal actions described above.  
 BBSI is subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management,
the amount of ultimate liability with respect to other currently pending or threatened actions is not expected to materially affect BBSI s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 2.  
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       Effective September 23,
2016, the Company granted a Company employee restricted stock units ( RSUs ) relating to a total of 2,000 shares of Company common stock. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of Company common stock. The award vests
in four equal annual installments, commencing September 23, 2017, and is subject to continued service as an employee of the Company.   The
award described above was granted pursuant to the Company s stockholder-approved 2015 Stock Incentive Plan and issued as consideration for services rendered by the recipient. The Company did not receive any cash consideration in connection
with the award.    The securities described above were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933.    The Company maintains a Board-approved stock repurchase program, which in October 2008 authorized up to 3.0
million shares of the Company s common stock to be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases. The repurchase program allows for the repurchase of approximately 1.1 million shares as of September 30, 2016. The Company s credit
agreement with its primary bank currently prohibits the repurchase of any Company common stock.

EXHIBIT 10.1   
  CHANGE IN CONTROL   
  EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT     THIS
CHANGE IN CONTROL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ( Agreement ), dated August 19, 2016, is by and between BARRETT BUSINESS SERVICES, INC., a Maryland corporation ( Corporation ), and Gary Kramer ( Executive ). 
 The Board of Directors of Corporation (the  Board ), has determined that it is in the best interests of Corporation and its
stockholders to assure that Corporation will have the continued dedication of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) of Corporation. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish
the inevitable distraction of Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change in Control and to encourage Executive s full attention and dedication to Corporation currently and in the event
of any threatened or pending Change in Control, and to provide Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change in Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of Executive will be satisfied and which are
competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused Corporation to enter into this Agreement. 
 Corporation and Executive agree as follows:      
   This Agreement commences on the date of this Agreement and will continue in effect
until December 31, 2017; provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2017, and each subsequent January 1, the term of this Agreement will automatically be extended for one additional calendar year unless at least 90 days prior to
such January 1, Corporation or Executive will have given notice that this Agreement will not be extended; and provided, further, that if a Change in Control occurs while this Agreement is in effect, this Agreement will automatically be extended
for a period of one calendar year beyond the calendar year in which the Change in Control occurs.   This Agreement will terminate on the
earliest of:    (a) Executive s Separation from Service other than within 12 months following a Change in Control, provided, however,
that if it is reasonably demonstrated by Executive that such Separation from Service (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or
anticipation of a Change in Control, then such Separation from Service will be deemed to have occurred immediately following a Change in Control;  
 (b) Corporation s satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement; or  
 (c) this Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
      - 1 -

 (ii) During any period of 12 consecutive calendar months, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board cease for any

 3.2   Outside Activities   .  Executive will at all times, faithfully and to the best of his ability, perform all of the
duties that may be required of him pursuant to this Agreement. Executive will devote his entire working time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties hereunder and will not, during the term of this Agreement, be engaged in any
other business activity, whether or not such business activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement will preclude Executive from devoting time during reasonable periods required

Than for Cause, Death or Disability   .    If Executive Separates from Service within 12 months after a Change in Control on account of (i) involuntary Separation from Service other than for Cause, death, or Disability due to
the independent exercise of the unilateral authority of Corporation, or (ii) voluntary Separation from Service by Executive for Good Reason: Corporation shall pay to Executive promptly within 30 days from the date of Separation from Service (and in
no event later than March 15 of the calendar year after the year in which the date of Separation from Service occurred), in a lump sum in cash, the amount equal to the product of (1) three and (2) the sum of (x) Executive s Annual Base
Salary and (y) the Target Bonus, in each case as in effect on the date that the Change in Control occurred.    4.2   No
Obligation   .  Corporation will have no obligation to make any payment or offer any benefits to Executive on Separation from Service under this Agreement except as explicitly set forth in Section 4.1.  

5.  
  PARACHUTE PAYMENTS.       5.1   Reduction for Excess Parachute Payments   .
 In the event that any portion of the Total Payments payable to Executive in connection with his Separation from Service would constitute an  excess parachute payment  within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b) that, but for this
Section, would be subject to the excise tax imposed on so-called excess parachute payments pursuant to Code Section 4999 (an  Excise Tax ), then the payments otherwise payable under this Agreement will be reduced to the largest amount
payable to Executive which would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax.  
      - 5 -  

5.2   Application   .  For purposes of this Section:  
 (a) No portion of the Total Payments, the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive has effectively waived in writing prior to the date of
payment, will be taken into account;    (b) No portion of the Total Payments will be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel
selected by Corporation and reasonably acceptable to Executive ( Tax Counsel ), does not constitute a  parachute payment  within the meaning of Code Section 280G;  
 (c) If Executive and Corporation disagree whether any payment will result in an Excise Tax, the matter will be conclusively resolved by an
opinion of Tax Counsel;    (d) The value of any noncash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments, and
whether or not all or a portion of any payment or benefit is a  parachute payment  for purposes of this Section, will be determined by Corporation s independent accountants in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3)
and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code.    5.3   Effect on Other Agreements   .  In the event that any other agreement,
plan, or arrangement provides for Other Payments (an  Other Agreement ), Corporation and Executive agree that the Other Payment governed by such Other Agreement will be subject to the reduction in payments under Section 5.1. To the
extent possible, Corporation and Executive agree that reductions in benefits under any plan, program, or arrangement of Corporation will be reduced (only to the extent described in Section 5.1) in the following order of priority:  
 (a) Cash payments under this Agreement;  
 (b) Any cash payments under any Other Agreement; and  
 (c) The acceleration in the exercisability or vesting of any stock option or other stock related award granted by Corporation.  

6.  
  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.      Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit
of Corporation all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to Corporation or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive s employment by
Corporation or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by Executive or representatives of Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of Executive s employment with
Corporation, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of Corporation or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than Corporation and those
designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 6 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to Executive under this Agreement.  

7.  
  MISCELLANEOUS.       7.1   Arbitration   .  Any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement will be resolved exclusively by arbitration, which, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, will be administered by and in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Service of Portland, Inc. The place of
arbitration will be Multnomah County, Oregon, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. 
      - 6 -  

The award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and judgment may be entered on the award in any court having jurisdiction. The parties may endeavor to resolve disputes by
mediation at any time as they may agree,  provided ,  however , that resolution of disputes by mediation is not required prior to initiating resolution of disputes by arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph, Corporation may seek equitable relief in any court having jurisdiction with respect to a breach of Section 6 ( Confidential Information ). Any demand for arbitration must be delivered in writing to the other party within a
reasonable time after the claim or dispute has arisen;  provided ,  however , that in no event may such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim or dispute would be barred by the
applicable statute of limitations.    7.2   At-Will Employment   .  Executive and Corporation acknowledge that Executive
is and will be an at-will employee of Corporation and nothing in this Agreement will limit the right of Corporation or Executive to terminate Executive s employment at any time for any reason or for no reason, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement describing the compensation payable, if any, in connection with such a termination of employment.    7.3
  Captions   .  All captions are solely for convenience of the parties and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  
 7.4   Entire Agreement   .  The entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is
contained in this Agreement, and it supersedes and replaces all other agreements pertaining to Executive s employment by Corporation; provided, however, that this Agreement does not supersede or invalidate other agreements and understandings
between the parties relating to benefit plans and other personal benefits provided to Executive, equity awards made to Executive, or noncompetition agreements. There are no promises or representations made on behalf of Corporation to induce
Executive to enter into this Agreement which are not set forth herein.    7.5   Exemption from Code Section
409A   .      This Agreement is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code by reason of all payments under this Agreement being  short-term deferrals  within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4). All provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with preserving this exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the  short-term deferral  exemption is
not available, if Executive is a  specified employee  as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i), payments under this Agreement that are subject to Code Section 409A will not be made, or commenced, until the
expiration of six months following the date of Executive s Separation from Service. In no event will Corporation be liable for any tax, interest, or penalties that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or any damages for failing
to comply with Code Section 409A.    7.6   Governing Law   .  This Agreement will be governed, construed, and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to principles of conflicts of law.    7.7
  Modification   .  No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement will be valid or enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by Corporation and Executive or their respective successors and legal representatives.  
      - 7 -  

7.8   Notices   .    Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and
will be deemed given when delivered in person, one business day after being sent by overnight courier, or four business days after being mailed by certified mail. Notices to Corporation must be addressed to Barrett Business Services, Inc.,
Attention: Chairman of the Board, at Corporation s headquarters address. Notices to Executive are to be sent to the last address Executive has provided from time to time to Corporation s human resources department. Either party may
change its address for notices by giving notice of the change to the other party.    7.9   Severability   .  The
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.    7.10
  Source of Payments   .  This Agreement will be unfunded. Any payments provided for under this Agreement will be made from the general assets of Corporation. 
 7.11   Successors   .   
 (a) This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of Corporation shall not be assignable by Executive
otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive s legal representatives.  
 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Corporation and its successors and assigns.  
 (c) Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of Corporation to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
As used in this Agreement,  Corporation  shall mean Corporation as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.  
 7.12   Waiver   .  Executive s or Corporation s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this
Agreement, or the failure to assert any right Executive or Corporation may have hereunder, will not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision of or right under this Agreement.  
 7.13   Withholding   .  Corporation may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local or
foreign taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have
executed this Agreement as of the day and year first herein written.

equal to the Applicable Taxes, (b) to authorize Corporation to withhold a number of unrestricted Shares (thus reducing the number of unrestricted Shares to be issued to Participant) having a Fair Market Value (as of the Settlement Date) equal to the
remaining balance of the Applicable Taxes, or (c) to authorize Corporation to withhold an amount equal to the Applicable Taxes from Participant s payroll check or deposit to be made on or about the Settlement Date, provided such withholding is

taxes, if this box     is checked). See  Instructions  below.  Note: This alternative is not available for incentive stock options.

My irrevocable direction to my securities broker (see below) to sell Shares subject to the Option and deliver a portion of the sales proceeds to BBSI in full payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price (as well as any withholding taxes,
if this box     is checked). See  Instructions  below. I hereby confirm that any sale of Shares will be in compliance with BBSI s policies on insider trading and Rule 144, if

ATTESTATION FORM   
 As indicated above, I have elected to use shares of BBSI common stock that I already own to pay the Aggregate Purchase Price of the Option (and withholding
taxes, if applicable).    I attest to the ownership of the shares represented by the certificate(s) listed below or to the beneficial ownership of the
shares held in the name of my broker, as indicated in the attached copy of my brokerage statement. I will be deemed to have delivered such shares to BBSI in connection with the exercise of my Option.  
 I understand that, because I (and any joint owner) will retain ownership of the shares (the  Payment Shares ) deemed delivered to pay the Aggregate
Purchase Price (and withholding taxes, if applicable), the number of shares to be issued to me upon exercise of my Option will be reduced by the number of Payment Shares. I represent that I have full power to deliver and convey certificates
representing the Payment Shares to BBSI and by such delivery and conveyance could have caused BBSI to become sole owner of the Payment Shares. The joint owner of the Payment Shares, if any, by signing this Form, consents to these
representations and to the exercise of the Option by this attestation.    I certify that any Payment Shares originally issued to me as restricted shares are
now fully vested.    List certificate(s) and number of shares covered, or attach a copy of your brokerage statement:
