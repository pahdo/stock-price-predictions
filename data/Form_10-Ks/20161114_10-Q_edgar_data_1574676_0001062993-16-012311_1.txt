      Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial
      Statements    
   
      September 30, 2016     
  NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016,
and for all periods presented herein, have been made.  
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted. It is
suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial statements included in its Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of
operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and the same period last year
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.  
  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
incurred net losses and net cash used in operations since inception. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company s ability to achieve a level of profitability. The Company
intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital
needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional
funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until
such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working
capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
  NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   CONCENTRATIONS   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 9% of sales
were to a single related party customer. In addition, two other third party
customers contributed to 56% of total revenue for nine months ended September
30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 67% of sales were to a
single related party customer. During the three months ended September 30, 2016,
9% of sales were to a single related party customer. In addition, one other
third party customer contributed to 53% of total revenue for three months ended
September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, 9% of sales
were to a single related party customer. In addition, one other third party
customer contributed to 59% of total revenue for three months ended September
30, 2015.  
 As of September 30, 2016, accounts receivable from one related
party customer comprised 68% of total accounts receivable before it netted with
accounts payable due to the same related party and accounts receivable from one
third party customer comprised 31% of accounts receivable. As of December 31,
2015, accounts receivable from one third party customer comprised 81% of
accounts receivable, while another third-party customer comprised 12% of
accounts receivable.  
   NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE    
 Basic net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year.
Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed similar to basic net income
(loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common
stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive.  
 During fiscal year 2015 and for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, all common stock equivalents were excluded as they would have been
anti-dilutive the dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the
dilutive effect of the outstanding common stock options was 9,266,366 shares and
convertible debt was 22,185,176 shares with a reduction to net income of
$512,471.  
 F-6 

INVENTORIES      
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a
first-in, first-out basis ( FIFO ), or market, including direct material costs
and direct and indirect manufacturing costs. Inventory consists of the following
amounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 
   FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING    
 As required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
(Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2)
inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable
either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there
is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
own assumptions.  
 The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described
below:  
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;  
 Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs
that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability;  
 Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that
are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).  
 The following table sets forth by level with the fair value
hierarchy the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of
September 30, 2016:  
 
  NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to forty years.
A summary is as follows:  
 
 Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was
$14,826 and $14,061 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively and $4,942 and $4,257 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

discount is being amortized over the one year life of the promissory note. As of
September 30, 2016, $125,000 of the discount has been amortized as interest
expense. Interest amortized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $0 and $61,986, respectively. The Company repaid $125,000 under this
note during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the outstanding
balance was $125,000 as of September 30, 2016. 
 This conversion option was accounted for as a derivative
liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in a
reclassification of the fair value of the derivative liability of $6,175 from
equity (see Note 8). 
  NOTE 8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
identified conversion features embedded within its convertible debt. The Company
has determined that the conversion feature of the Notes represents an embedded
derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of shares upon
conversion. Accordingly, the embedded conversion feature must be bifurcated from
the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Therefore, the fair
value of the derivative instruments have been recorded as liabilities on the
balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as discounts to the Notes.
Such discounts will be accreted from the issuance date to the maturity date of
the Notes. The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities will be
recorded in other income or expenses in the statement of operations at the end
of each period, with the offset to the derivative liabilities on the balance
sheet. The fair values of the embedded derivative liabilities were determined
using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the issuance dates with the
assumptions in the table below.  
 The change in fair value of the Company s derivative
liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities
for the three months ending March 31, 2016 totaled $114,661 and the gain on the
change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the three months ending
September 30, 2016 totaled $534,230.  
 F-10 

The fair value at the issuance and remeasurement dates for the
convertible debt treated as derivative liabilities are based upon the following
estimates and assumptions made by management for the nine months ended September
30, 2016: 

NOTE 9 - SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY   
  COMMON STOCK   
 The authorized common stock of the Company consists of
500,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 91,816,100 and
86,126,100 shares of the Company s common stock were issued and outstanding. 
 In October 2014, the Company entered into an agreement for the
issuance of 1,000,000 common shares for CAD/CAM Engineering Design Services for
GLFH1200 series battery development. The shares vest in equal installments of
250,000 each year following the date of the agreement. On May 1, 2015, the
Company issued 250,000 shares under this award. Since inception through
September 30, 2016, $118,311 was expensed under this award and $0 remains to be
expensed over the remaining service period. This nonemployee award is valued
upon completion of services. This nonemployee signed an agreement effective July
22, 2016 between them and the Company acknowledging that the Company does not
anticipate the need for any additional engineering contract services resulting
in the return of non-vested options back to the Company. This resulted in a
reduction to engineering research and development expense of $23,311 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 In July 2016, the Company entered into an agreement for the
issuance of 1,000,000 common shares for consulting services. The shares are to
be transferred in four quarterly installments of two hundred fifty thousand
shares on or before the fifth day of the following months: August 2016, October
2016, January 2017, and April 2017. On August 5, 2016, the Company issued
250,000 shares under this award. Since inception through September 30, 2016,
$14,188 was expensed under this award and $4,312 remains to be expensed over the
remaining service period. A total of ($25,217) expense, net of revaluation of prior period, was recorded for common stock issued for services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 On September 1, 2016 Vista converted $9,954 of the February
2016 Vista Convertible Note into a total of 790,000 shares of Common Stock at a
fair value of $0.01260 per share. See Note 6. 
 On September 12, 2016 JMJ converted $8,820 of the March 2016
JMJ Convertible Note into a total of 700,000 shares of Common Stock at a fair
value of $0.01260 per share. See Note 6.

 On September 28, 2016 JMJ converted $7,344 of the March 2016JMJ
Convertible Note into a total of 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock at a fair
value of $0.006120 per share. See Note 6.  
 On September 28, 2016 Vista converted $10,200 of the February
2016 Vista Convertible Note into a total of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at
a fair value of $0.0051 per share. See Note 6.  
  NOTE 10 - OPTIONS   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company granted an
aggregate of 2,050,000 options to a military sales representative and three
employees. Col. Ashton Naylor (Ret) received 100,000 options exercisable at
$0.25 per share, Chris Watkins received 750,000 options exercisable at $0.25 per
share, Jeff Roach received 1,000,000 options exercisable at $0.20 per share, and
Brian Nallin received 200,000 options exercisable at $0.20 per share. These
options expire on April 1, 2016; June 11, 2020, February 1, 2017, and December
31, 2017 respectively. The options granted to Brian Nallin vest immediately and
the other options vest in equal tranches over periods ranging from 2 to 5 years.
The aggregate fair value of the option grants was determined to be $430,839
using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the following assumptions:
volatilities between 218% and 396%, risk free rates between .27% and 1.74%,
expected terms between 1 and 5 years and zero expected dividends. The fair value
of the award is being expensed over the vesting periods. $295,553 was expensed during the year ended
December 31, 2015, $24,703 was expensed during the three months ended March 31,
2016, $18,741 was expensed during the three months ended June 30, 2016, and
$10,958 was expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Jeff
Roach and Brian Nallin both voluntarily terminated employment with the Company
on February 12, 2016 resulting in Jeff returning non-vested options back to the
Company. This resulted in a reversal of prior period share based compensation
and option expense of $26,745 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
As of September 30, 2016, $63,707 remains to be expensed over the remaining
vesting period.  
 F-11 

As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,700,000 options
  outstanding of which 1,250,000 were exercisable. The range of exercise prices
  and remaining weighted average life of the options outstanding at September 30,
  2016 were $0.20 to $0.25 and 2.06 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic
value of the outstanding options at September 30, 2016 was $0.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in this report and those in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result
of certain factors, including but not limited to, those described under  Risk
Factors  included in Part II, Item IA of this report.   
  Background Overview   Galenfeha incorporated in the
State of Nevada on March 14, 2013, as a for-profit company with a fiscal year
end of December 31. Our executive office is located at 420 Throckmorton Street,
Suite 200, Ft. Worth Texas 76102, and the Company s manufacturing facility is
located at 9204 Linwood Avenue, Suite 104, Shreveport, LA. 71106. Our Telephone
numbers are Toll free  1-800-280-2404 , International
 1-817-945-6448 , and our facsimile number is  817-887-1455 . Our
email address is  info@galenfeha.com  and our website address is

 In 2014, GLFH developed new battery technology primarily
designed to operate automation and measurement computers in remote oil field
locations. Such technology provides an environmentally friendly, inherently
safe, internally temperature regulated, uninterruptible power supply for oil and
gas well location automation and measurement equipment. Throughout 2014 this
battery system proved effective in rigorous field-testing and was placed in to
marketable production, now known as LiFePO4 battery systems. 
 During initial production, GLFH developed a private label,
unique, user interface driven, real-time battery state of charge and asset
tracking system that is internally integrated within the Company s line of
LiFePO4 battery systems. The system communicates the current battery
performance, and operates as a Cloud driven database to collect and collate
individual client information and uses unique ESN numeric identifiers to
reference each client s specific asset performance and inventory. Asset-tracking
utilizes a combination of CDMA technologies coupled with satellite geo-location
referencing to accurately monitor and track the battery system in the event of
theft. 
 Early third quarter 2014, GLFH began shipping its patent
pending battery systems to a multi-state distributor in Shreveport, Louisiana.
The battery system saw rapid acceptance within the industry, thus increasing oil
and gas demand through the remainder of 2014. 
 In 2015, GLFH began researching the use of this battery
technology outside of the oil and gas industry. In conjunction with alternative
markets, GLFH successfully tested a proof-of-concept model for use in zero
emission recreational vehicles such as golf carts and an off-road UTV
gas/electric hybrid platform. Additionally, GLFH sought additional product lines
to its battery systems to increase revenue while establishing a synergy among
products such that each product line could add value to the other.  
 GLFH acquired DayLight Pump, LLC, a chemical injection pump
manufacturing company, in early 2015 and all operations and manufacturing were
relocated to Shreveport, Louisiana. Following slight enhancements to the
DayLight Pump design and following rigorous field-testing, DayLight Pumps, as we
know them today were manufactured and placed into final production. As planned,
these chemical injection stations incorporate the GLFH LiFePO4 battery systems,
at various levels. DayLight Pumps with GLFH LiFePO4 battery systems were
introduced into the commercial market mid-2015. 
 GLFH realized growth in overall product sales in 2015 for
reasons threefold: 1.) Increased market acceptance of our products, 2.)
Embedding the battery technology within our chemical injection pump systems
which not only serves to further validate product viability but also assisted in
expanding beyond automation and measurement to the production sector of the
petroleum industry, 3.) Introduction of our technology outside the petroleum
industry in to additional markets. 2015 goals were met regarding zero emissions
vehicle testing, the successful acquisition of Daylight Pump, LLC, as well as
the initial design of a second-generation battery management system. Chemical
injection pumps and accessories showed significant increase gross revenue, as
desired and the company was able to branch out of the oil and gas market to the
United States Armed Forces in the testing of GLFH LiFePO4 battery systems for
use in automated range targeting systems. Armed Forces testing was completed
mid-year 2015 with two facilities performing simultaneous field-testing which
ultimately proved successful. Third quarter 2015 saw the first shipment of GLFH
LiFePO4 battery systems to Fort Campbell. Such a milestone is of note as it
represents a first not only for GLFH, but also the acceptance and usage of the
LiFePO4 chemistry by the United States Government. 
 2015 also proved successful in that a solidified distribution
network was established with a number of national and long-standing regional
distribution partners opening the GLFH product line to nationwide distribution.
Promptly following the establishment of the distribution network, hands-on
product training sessions were conducted personally with each distribution hub
while initial stocking orders were placed and shipped across the nation. 
 Since the Company s inception, the Company has accomplished key
milestones outlined in its 2014-2015 statement of work. A majority of the monies
spent to date have been for initial financing actives related to creating a
public company, product development, including research and field-testing as well as for the
purchase of inventory and ordinary day-to-day operations. We anticipate that in
2016, the Company will increase profitability, and that cash flow will be such
as to allow for the production of additional inventory items to reduce
lead-times for product sales, continued market growth and the development of
those products desired within our market sectors which may add to the synergies
already enjoyed.

Liquidity   
  Assets   
 At September 30, 2016, we had total assets of $1,693,538, of
which $313,817 was in cash.  
  Results of Operations for the Three Months ending September
30, 2016   
  Revenues   
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $322,009, and $275,518, respectively. Of the $322,009; $292,649 were to
third parties and $29,360 were to related parties. Of the $275,518; $249,681
were to third parties and $25,838 were to related parties. The increase is from
the Company reaching out and servicing other industries like the military
instead of completely reliance on the oil and gas industry for batter and pump
sales. Additionally the Company is now much less reliant on sales from related
parties as these sales only represent around 10% of the total revenue
figures. 
  Cost of Revenues   
 Cost of Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $243,493 and $216,141, respectively. Costs were cost of materials
and manufacturing supplies with the increase due to increase of sales compared
with the prior period. Gross profit percentages were very similar to the prior
period presented. 
  Operating Expense   
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $228,689 and $784,141, respectively. Expenses decreased
as the Company has decreased its managerial/higher wage workforce and lowered
overhead costs because of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. Furthermore
the Company issued stock options and awards for consulting services and legal
services rendered during the three months ending September 30, 2015. The
accounting treatment of these stock awards and options increased expenses by
$428,522 in the three months ending September 30, 2015. 
  Net Operating Profit (Loss) and Net Profit (Loss)   
 Net operating profit (loss) for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was ($150,173) and ($724,763) respectively. The
Company realized a lower net loss because of reduced payroll costs and
corresponding share based compensation relating to employee stock options,
reduced option expense for initial research and development engineering
services, reduced expenses due to shares subscribed for legal services rendered
and lower advertising costs. 
 Net profit (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $248,382 and ($759,126) respectively. The Company realized a net
profit compared to the prior period because of fair market value adjustments on
the payoff of certain derivative contracts associated with procuring additional
financing. 
  Results of Operations for the Nine Months ending September
30, 2016   
  Revenues   
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $729,804, and $835,005, respectively. Of the $729,804; $664,060 were to
third parties and $65,744 were to related parties. Of the $835,005; $279,258
were to third parties and $555,747 were to related parties. The decrease is in
revenue from the Company loosing distribution contracts with oil and gas supply
companies due to lack of demand in the oil and gas industry. However, the
Company is reaching out and servicing other industries like the military instead
of completely reliance on the oil and gas industry for batter and pump sales.
Sales from third parties increased significantly compared to the prior year
because of less dependence on related parties of the Company.

Cost of Revenues   
 Cost of Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $535,657 and $521,737, respectively. Costs were cost of materials
and manufacturing supplies with the increase due to sales returns to oil  
gas supply companies and better control of inventory counts compared to the
prior period. 
  Operating Expense   
 Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $632,171 and $1,351,920, respectively. Expenses decreased
as the Company has decreased its managerial/higher wage workforce and lowered
overhead costs because of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. Furthermore
the Company issued stock options and awards for consulting services and legal

share based compensation relating to employee stock options, reduced option
expense for initial research and development engineering services, reduced
expenses due to shares subscribed for legal services rendered and lower
advertising costs.  
 Net profit (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was ($752,987) and ($1,146,999) respectively. The Company realized a
lower net loss because of lower operating costs compared to the prior
period.

 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 As of the end of period covered by this report, the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  
 (b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.  
 No changes were made to the Company's internal controls in the
quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely materially to affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
