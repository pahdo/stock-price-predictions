    FAMOUS DAVE S OF AMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    
     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        (1) Basis of Presentation       We, Famous Dave s of
America, Inc. ( Famous Dave s  or the  Company ), were incorporated in Minnesota on March 14, 1994. We develop, own, operate and franchise restaurants under the name  Famous Dave s . As of October 2,
2016, there were 176 Famous Dave s restaurants operating in 32 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Canada, and United Arab Emirates, including 37 company-owned restaurants and 139 franchise-operated restaurants. An additional 62 franchise
restaurants were committed to be developed through signed Area Development Agreements as of October 2, 2016.      We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Rules and Regulations. These unaudited financial statements represent the
consolidated financial statements of Famous Dave s and its subsidiaries as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. The
information furnished in these financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 as filed with the SEC.      Due to the seasonality of our business, revenue and operating results for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year.       (2) Net Income Per Share       Basic net income per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted EPS equals net income divided
by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus all additional common stock equivalents, such as stock options and restricted stock units, when dilutive.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
   Following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share:
      
    There were 543,000 and 221,000 options outstanding for the three and nine months ended
October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive.       (3) Restricted Cash and Marketing Fund       We have a
system-wide Public Relations and Marketing Development Fund, to which Company-owned restaurants, in addition to the majority of franchise-operated restaurants, contribute a percentage of net sales, currently 1.0%, for use in public relations and
marketing development efforts throughout the system. The assets held by this fund are considered restricted. Accordingly, we reflect the cash related to this fund in restricted cash and reflect the liability in accounts payable on our consolidated
balance sheets as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016. We had approximately $1.1 million in this fund as of October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016.   
  In conjunction with the Company s Credit Agreement, we have deposited 105% of the face amount of the undrawn letters
of credit in a cash collateral account with the Administrative Agent. We had approximately $1.0 million in restricted cash as of October 2, 2016, related to these undrawn letters of credit. We were not required to deposit funds in the cash
collateral account as of January 3, 2016.       (4) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    
    Accounts Receivable, Net     We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts on accounts receivable
based on historical losses and existing economic conditions, when relevant. We provide for a general bad debt reserve for franchise receivables due to increases in days sales outstanding and deterioration in general economic market
conditions. This general reserve is based on the aging of receivables meeting specified criteria and is adjusted each quarter based on past due receivable balances. Additionally, we have periodically established a specific reserve on
certain receivables as necessary. Any changes to the reserve are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The allowance for uncollectible accounts was approximately $695,000 and $246,000, at October 2, 2016 and January 3,
2016, respectively. Accounts receivable are written off when they become

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
   
uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances written off have not exceeded allowances
provided. We believe all accounts receivable in excess of the allowance are fully collectible. If accounts receivable in excess of provided allowances are determined uncollectible, they are charged to expense in the period that determination is
made. Outstanding past due accounts receivable are subject to a monthly interest charge on unpaid balances which is recorded as interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. In assessing recoverability of these receivables, we
make judgments regarding the financial condition of the franchisees based primarily on past and current payment trends, as well as other variables, including annual financial information, which the franchisees are required to submit to us, as well
as other variables.       (5) Intangible Assets, net    
  The Company has intangible assets that consist of liquor licenses and lease interest assets. The liquor licenses are
indefinite lived assets and are not subject to amortization. The lease interest assets are amortized to occupancy costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each respective lease. Amortization of the lease interest assets is expected
to be approximately $47,500 per year, for the remaining useful life.      A reconciliation of beginning and ending
amounts of intangible assets at October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, are presented in the table below:

    6) Credit Facility, Long-Term Debt and Debt Covenants    
  On June 10, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries (each, a  Borrower  and collectively, the
 Borrowers ) entered into a Waiver and Second Amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the  Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo, National Association as
administrative agent and lender (the  Administrative Agent ). The Second Amendment Effective Date, as defined in the Second Amendment, is June 10, 2016. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated
to terminate the revolving credit loan commitment (the  Facility ), change the maturity date of the revolving credit loans and the term loan from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017, and obligate monthly payments of $200,000
to reduce the principal amount of the loans. Additionally, the Borrowers deposited 105% of the face amount of the outstanding letters of credit in a cash collateral account with the Administrative Agent which is included in restricted cash on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.      At October 2, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the Facility and
the Term Loan was $1.9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, along with approximately $1.0 million in letters of credit for real estate locations. The Credit Agreement allows for termination by the Borrower without penalty at any time. Under the
Credit Agreement, the Borrowers have granted the Lender a security interest in all current and future personal property of the Borrower.      Principal amounts outstanding under the Facility bear interest either at an adjusted Eurodollar rate or  Base Rate  plus an applicable margin. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and
September 27, 2015, our weighted average interest rate for the Facility was 3.67% and 2.64%, respectively.   
  Principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loan bear interest at the same rate as the Facility. The weighted average
interest rate of the Term Loan for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 was 3.70%. There was no Term Loan at September 27, 2015.      The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type. For more information regarding the details of the customary affirmative and negative
covenants, please refer to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 8, 2015 filed as Exhibit 10.2 to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2015, which was filed on May 8, 2015, the First
Amendment to the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed on December 11, 2015, and the Waiver and Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K
filed on June 10, 2016.      For the quarter ended October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all
covenants of the Credit Agreement except the Adjusted Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA covenants.      For the quarter ended October 2, 2016 the Adjusted Leverage Ratio was 5.57:1.00, which is higher than the maximum Adjusted Leverage Ratio permitted by the Credit Agreement of 5.50:1.00   
  For the quarter ended October 2, 2016 our Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 million, which is less than the minimum Adjusted
EBITDA permitted by the Credit Agreement of $1.5 million for this quarter.      It is an Event of Default under the
Credit Agreement if Borrowers fail to comply with either the Adjusted Leverage Ratio or minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant or any other covenant. Upon an Event of Default, the Lender has the right to declare the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding loans; all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other loan document to be immediately due and payable, as well as to exercise its other rights as a secured creditor. In
addition, we are prohibited under the Credit Agreement from making dividends or distributions from one Borrower to another Borrower and purchasing common stock pursuant to a board-approved stock purchase program.   
  On November 9, 2016, the Borrowers and Lender entered into a Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which the Lender
agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement relating to the existing defaults during a Forbearance Period ending December 9, 2016 or on the earlier date of any other Event

of Default under the Credit Agreement or breach of the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement we have agreed not to request and Wells Fargo is not obligated to make any further
extensions of credit to us under the Credit Agreement. During the Forbearance Period, we intend to closely manage our expenses and cash balances to prevent a working capital shortfall. At November 9, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under
the Facility was $9.9 million, along with approximately $595,000 in letters of credit for real estate locations.   
  During the first nine months of fiscal 2016 the Company generated approximately $2.7 million in cash from operating
activities compared to $2.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. As of October 2, 2016, the Company ended the third quarter with total net debt of approximately $5.8 million. This compares to $11.4 million of net debt as of September
27, 2015.      During the Forbearance Period the Company intends to finalize its refinancing arrangement. As a
result of the Events of Default at October 2, 2016 and given the length of the Forbearance Period, all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement were classified as current liabilities.   
   (7) Other Current Liabilities       Other current liabilities consisted of the following at:

    (9) Performance Shares, Stock Options, Other Forms of Compensation, and Common Share Repurchases
       Stock-based Compensation    
  Effective May 5, 2015, we adopted a 2015 Equity Plan (the  2015 Plan ), pursuant to which we may grant
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other stock and cash awards to eligible participants. We also maintain an Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan (the  2005 Plan ). Together, the 2015 Plan and 2005 Plan are referred to herein as the  Plans.  Under the 2015 Plan, an aggregate of 103,800 shares of our Company s common stock remained unreserved and available for
issuance at October 2, 2016. The 2005 Plan prohibits the granting of incentives after May 12, 2015, the tenth anniversary of the date such Plan was approved by the Company s shareholders. Nonetheless, the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
will remain in effect until all outstanding incentives granted thereunder have either been satisfied or terminated.      We recognized stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, as follows:

(1)    
    The three and nine months ended September 27, 2015 included the recapture of previously recorded stock-based compensation of approximately
$105,000 due to employee departures.      

(2)    
    The nine months ended October 2, 2016 included the recapture of previously recorded stock-based compensation of approximately $126,000 due to
the departure of our previous CFO.          Board of Directors  Compensation    
  We recognized board of directors  compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the three and
nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, as follows:

    Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) See footnote 18,
Subsequent Events, for additional information          
 
  The compensation expense for stock option grants is recognized under general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statements of operations through the applicable service period.      Other options granted to certain
non-officer employees vest in equal annual installments over a period of four years and expire either five or ten years from the grant date. Compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is generally recognized for these awards over the
vesting period.      Options granted to certain non-employees in exchange for future services either vest in
monthly installments over a period of approximately two years or are granted monthly and vest immediately, and expire five years from the grant date. Expense equal to the current fair value is recognized over the vesting period, with the value being
marked to market in each accounting period for any unvested portions of the awards.      The fair value of each
stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation method with the assumptions noted in the table below. Due to a lack of recent historical share option exercise experience, the Company uses a simplified method for
estimating the expected life, as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 718, calculated using the following formula: (vesting term + original contract term)/2. Expected volatilities are based on the movement of the Company s common stock
price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. maturities over the expected life at the time of
grant.

   Information regarding our Company s 401(k) Plan is summarized
below:       
     Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan    
  We have a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan effective as of February 25, 2005 (the  Deferred Compensation
Plan ). Eligible participants are those employees who are at the  director  level and above and who are selected by the Company to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants must complete a deferral election each year
to indicate the level of compensation (salary, bonus and commissions) they wish to have deferred for the coming year. This deferral election is irrevocable except to the extent permitted by the Deferred Compensation Plan administrator, and the
applicable regulations promulgated by the IRS. The board of directors administers the Deferred Compensation Plan and may change the declared interest rate or any other aspects of the Deferred Compensation Plan at any time.   
  Deferral periods are limited to the earlier of termination of employment or not less than three calendar years following
the end of the applicable plan year. Extensions of the deferral period for a minimum of five years are allowed provided an election for extension is made at least one year before the first payment affected by the change. Payments can be in a lump
sum or in equal payments over a two-, five- or ten-year period, plus interest from the commencement date.      The
Deferred Compensation Plan assets are kept in an unsecured account that has no trust fund. In the event of bankruptcy, participants entitled to future payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan would have no greater rights than that of an
unsecured general creditor of the Company and the Deferred Compensation Plan confers no legal rights for interest or claim on any specific assets of the Company. Benefits provided by the Deferred Compensation Plan are not insured by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), because the pension insurance provisions of ERISA do not apply to the Deferred Compensation Plan.   
  The balance of the Plan for the quarters ended October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016 was approximately $163,000
and $547,000, respectively. Of this balance approximately $48,000 and $109,000 was recorded in current liabilities and the remaining balance was recorded in other liabilities at October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively.

   Information regarding our Company s Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan is summarized below:       
     (11) Asset Impairment and Estimated Lease Termination and Other Closing Costs    
  In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification for Property, Plant, and
Equipment, we evaluate restaurant sites and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of restaurant sites to be held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant site to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis. If a restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant s assets exceeds its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows, expected growth rates in comparable restaurant sales,
remaining lease terms, discount rate and other factors. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to take additional impairment charges for the related assets. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

   Following is a summary of asset impairment, estimated lease termination,
and other closing costs for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015:       

(1)    
    Asset impairment calculated at July 3, 2016 related to a software implementation project that was discontinued.      

(2)    
    Asset impairment calculated at June 28, 2015 based upon anticipated sale of Smithtown restaurant.      

(3)    
    Lease termination reserve associated with a letter of credit provided to a landlord for a previously closed restaurant.

(4)    
    Lease termination costs associated with the cancellation of a potential new restaurant location.      

(5)    
    Write off of development costs associated with the cancellation of a potential new restaurant location.      

(6)    
    Includes $191,000 in costs written-off associated with closing the Lombard, Illinois field office partially offset by an $86,000 recapture of
deferred rent credits.          Restaurant Optimization  During the third quarter of
fiscal 2016, the Company recorded approximately $3.4 million in asset impairment charges associated with 11 restaurants which were slow to respond to several initiatives to turnaround operating performance. As a result, the Company determined that
the estimated fair value of the assets was less than the net book value and recognized an impairment charge to reduce the related assets to the estimated fair value. As we continue to evaluate the restaurant portfolio we anticipate addressing the
ongoing operation of the 11 locations impaired over the next 3 years by way of lease restructuring, lease assignment or subsequent closure at the end of their natural lease term.

    (12) Fair Value Measurements    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement framework establishes a three-tier hierarchy. The three levels, in order of priority, are as follows:   

Level 1:    
      
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 1 measurements are determined by observable
inputs which include data sources and market prices available and visible outside of the entity.    

Level 2:    
      
    Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.    

Level 3:    
      
    Inputs that are used to estimate the fair value of the asset or liability. Level 3 measurements are determined by unobservable inputs, which include data
and analysis developed within the entity to assess the fair value.    
    Transfers in and out of levels will be based on our judgment of the availability of
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, other observable inputs, and non-observable inputs.     The following
table (in thousands) summarizes the assets held for sale and property and equipment, in each case measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016:   
   
    Assets Held for Sale were recorded at fair value and were valued based upon a Real Estate
Broker s Estimate of Value for the properties (Level 3) or negotiated sale price (Level 2). Property and Equipment recorded at fair value were valued based upon a Broker s Estimate of Value or estimated discounted future cash flows (Level
3). These assets were adjusted to net realizable value based upon the decision to dispose of the property. Total assets held for sale were reduced during the nine months ended October 2, 2016 due to the disposal of FDA s Chicago operations
sites (see note 13) and of one of the Richmond restaurants. The remaining assets held for sale at October 2, 2016 reflect the net realizable value of a restaurant (see note 11).

    (13) Discontinued Operations    
  On December 14, 2015, Famous Dave s of America, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
 Company ) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and related Real Estate Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreements ) with Windy City Restaurant Holdings LLC and its affiliate (together, the  Purchaser ) pursuant
to which the Company agreed to sell the assets comprising its seven Chicago, Illinois area Company-owned restaurants located in Addison, Algonquin, Bolingbrook, Evergreen Park, North Riverside, Orland Park and Oswego (collectively,  Purchased
Restaurants ) to the Purchaser.      Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the Company received a total
purchase price of $1.15 million during the quarter ended April 3, 2016, plus approximately $315,000 for the purchase of inventory on hand on the closing date. The Purchaser also assumed specified liabilities of the Company, including the
Company s existing leases for the Purchased Restaurants located in Bolingbrook, North Riverside and Orland Park, Illinois.      As a result of this asset sale, the Company recognized a pretax $1.1 million gain during the quarter ended April 3, 2016, primarily due to the write-off of the remaining $1.3 million deferred rent
liability associated with the leases assumed by the Purchaser, discussed above.      The net assets and liabilities
of the Purchased Restaurants associated with this transaction were included in assets and liabilities held for sale on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 3, 2016. No related assets or liabilities remained at October 2,
2016. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities included in the asset sale was as follows (in thousands):       
    The operating results of the Purchased Restaurants for the three and nine months ended
October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 are summarized below. These results include costs directly attributable to the components of the businesses which were divested. Interest expense of $32,000 and $21,000 were
allocated to discontinued operations for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, based upon the portion of the borrowing base associated with discontinued operations. Income tax expense (benefit)
of $378,000 and ($111,000) for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively have also been allocated to discontinued operations. These adjustments have been made for all periods presented.

     (14) Variable Interest Entities    
  Once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity (VIE), the party with the controlling financial interest,
the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. The Company has an installment agreement with a franchisee as the result of refranchising its Lincoln, Nebraska restaurant. While the franchise meets the definition of a VIE, the owners of the
franchise operations are the primary beneficiaries of the entities, not the Company. Therefore, the franchise operations are not required to be consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements.   
  On August 11, 2015, the Company consummated the sale of its Greenwood, Indiana and Florence, Kentucky restaurants. In
conjunction with that agreement, the Company entered into lease assignment agreements with the respective purchasers and landlords, releasing the Company of its obligations except in the event of default by the purchasers. As of October 2, 2016
and January 3, 2016, the amount of the future lease payments for which the Company would be liable in the event of a default are approximately $414,000. An accrual related to any future obligation was not considered necessary at October 2,
2016 as the Company has determined the fair value of this guarantee was zero as there was no indication that the purchasers would not be able to pay the required lease payments. While this franchise meets the definition of a VIE, the owners of the
franchise operations are the primary beneficiaries of the entities, not the Company. Therefore, the franchise operations are not required to be consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements.   
  On March 1, 2016, the Company consummated the sale of Chicago, Illinois restaurants. In conjunction with that
agreement, the Company entered into lease assignment agreements with the respective purchasers and three of the landlords, releasing the Company of its obligations except in the event of default by the purchasers. As of October 2, 2016, the
amount of the future lease payments for which the company would be liable in the event of a default are approximately $2.0 million. An accrual related to any future obligation was not considered necessary at October 2, 2016 as the Company has
determined the fair value of this guarantee was zero as there was no indication that the purchasers would not be able to pay the required lease payments. While this franchise meets the definition of a VIE, the owners of the franchise operations are
the primary beneficiaries of the entities, not the Company. Therefore, the franchise operations are not required to be consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements.       (15) Litigation       In the normal course of business, the
Company is involved in a number of litigation matters that are incidental to the operation of the business. These matters generally include, among other things, matters with regard to employment and general business-related issues. The Company
currently believes that the resolution of any of these pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity, but an adverse decision in more than one of the matters could be material to its consolidated
results of operations.

FAMOUS DAVE S OF AMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
   Famous Dave s of America, Inc. s ( Famous
Dave s ) filed a complaint on July 14, 2015, against a group of former franchisees in California seeking injunctive relief and damages for: (1) Federal Trademark Infringement; (2) Federal Trademark Dilution; (3) Federal
Unfair Competition; (4) Federal Trade Dress Dilution; (5) Trademark Infringement under California Business and Professions Code   14200; (6) Trademark Dilution under California Business and Professions Code  14200;
(7) Common Law Trademark Infringement; (8) Unfair Competition under California Business and Professions Code   17200; (9) False Advertising; (10) Breach of Contract; (11) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; and (12) Intentional Interference with Contract. The claims stem from the former franchisees  breaches of their franchise agreements, including the failure to pay franchise fees and their continued operation of five
restaurants utilizing Famous Dave s intellectual property without authorization. After two defendants in the case, Kurt Schneiter and M Mart 1, filed a demurrer to the Complaint, Famous Dave s filed an Amended Complaint on October 9,
2015, reasserting the same claims. The case is captioned Famous Dave s of America, Inc., v. SR El Centro FD, Inc., et al., Case No. BC589329, and is currently pending before the Honorable Elihu M. Berle in the Superior Court of Los Angeles. By
court order, dated June 6, 2016, Famous Dave s successfully obtained a preliminary injunction, enjoining the former franchisee defendants from using Famous Dave s intellectual property, including its trademarks and restaurant system.
The preliminary injunction is currently the subject of a pending interlocutory appeal which Famous Dave s intends to oppose vigorously.      On July 28, 2015, these franchisees (the  Plaintiffs ) filed a complaint against Famous Dave s in the South Judicial District of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles. On
March 10, 2016, Plaintiffs re-filed this Complaint as a First Amended Cross-Complaint [Famous Dave s of America, Inc. v. SR El Centro, Inc., et al., Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central Division, Case
No. BC589329] alleging that Famous Dave s breached the Franchise Agreements for these restaurants by failing to provide certain marketing support and access to customer contact data, vendors, internet reporting and support to Plaintiffs, and
failing to provide operations and preferred practices training to Plaintiffs  designated representative. Plaintiffs further allege that such conduct by Famous Dave s is a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs
also allege that Famous Dave s aided and abetted John and Allan Gantes in breach of their fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages in amount not less than $20 million, punitive damages, costs and attorneys 
fees.       (16) Supplemental Cash Flow Information        
     (17) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  in

16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  in May 2016 and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients  in May 2016. These new standards provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU
2014-09 until annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. It will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. It permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative
effect transition method and early adoption is not permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact these standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual
Items.  This update eliminates from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) the concept of extraordinary items. ASU 2015-01 is effective for the first interim period within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2015, with early adoption permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
statements. The Company adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2016, but it had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the financial statement presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of
the related debt liability rather than as an asset. The standard will become effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The
standard requires companies to apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods. The Company will adopt this at fiscal year-end of 2016 and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.      In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes, which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company plans to adopt this ASU at fiscal year-end of 2016 and is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its
consolidated financial statements.      In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),
which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting, Leases (Topic 840). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged. The amendments in
this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases
existing at, or entered into after the date of initial adoption, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and
classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.      In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other
Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

    (18) Subsequent Events    
  The Company evaluated for the occurrence of subsequent events through the issuance date of the Company s financial
statements. No other recognized or non-recognized subsequent events occurred that require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.   
  As of October 11, 2016, Adam Wright ceased being the Chief Executive Officer of Famous Dave s of America, Inc.
(the  Company ) and, effective October 12, 2016, resigned from the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ).      On October 11, 2016, the Company appointed Michael Lister to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Operating Officer, Mr. Lister has entered into an employment agreement which has a four year term. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Lister is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $300,000 and is eligible for annual bonus
compensation at the discretion of the Board in amounts expected to be 50% of his base salary, to be pro-rated in the case of any partial years worked. Provided that he is employed through December 31, 2016, Mr. Lister will
receive a guaranteed minimum bonus of $18,750 for 2016. The Company also granted to Mr. Lister five-year, 70,000 share non-qualified stock options under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that will vest in equal monthly installments
over the employment term (the  Stock Option ).

Item 2.   
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      
   Overview    
  Famous Dave s of America, Inc. was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in March 1994 and opened its first
restaurant in Minneapolis in June 1995. As of October 2, 2016, there were 176 Famous Dave s restaurants operating in 32 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Canada, and United Arab Emirates including 37 Company-owned restaurants and
139 franchise-operated restaurants. An additional 62 franchise restaurants were in various stages of development as of October 2, 2016.        Fiscal Year        Our fiscal year
ends on the Sunday closest to December 31   st   . Our
fiscal year is generally 52 weeks; however, it periodically consists of 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending January 1, 2017 (fiscal 2016) is a 52 week fiscal year while fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 (fiscal 2015) was a 53 week fiscal
year.        Revenue        Our revenue consists of restaurant sales, franchise-related revenue, and licensing and other revenue. Our franchise-related revenue is comprised of three separate and distinct earnings processes: area
development fees, initial franchise fees, and continuing royalty payments. Currently, our domestic area development fee for domestic growth consists of a one-time, non-refundable payment of approximately $10,000 per restaurant in consideration for
the services we perform in preparation of executing each area development agreement. For our foreign area development agreements, the one time, non-refundable payment is negotiated on a per development basis and is determined based on the costs
incurred to arrange for the sale of that development area. Substantially all of these services, which include, but are not limited to, conducting market and trade area analysis, a meeting with Famous Dave s Executive Team, and performing
potential franchise background investigations, are completed prior to our execution of the area development agreement and receipt of the corresponding area development fee. As a result, we recognize this fee upon receipt of the signed development
agreement. Currently, our initial, non-refundable, franchise fee for domestic growth is $45,000 per restaurant, of which approximately $5,000 is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed, reflecting the commission earned and
expenses incurred related to the sale. The remaining non-refundable fee is included in deferred franchise fees and is recognized as revenue when we have performed substantially all of our obligations, which generally occurs upon the franchise
entering into a lease agreement for the restaurant(s). Finally, franchisees are also required to pay us a monthly royalty equal to a percentage of their net sales, which has historically varied from 4% to 5%. In general, new franchises pay us a
monthly royalty of 5% of their net sales.        Costs and Expenses     
  Restaurant costs and expenses include food and beverage costs, labor and benefits costs, operating expenses which include
occupancy costs, repair and maintenance costs, supplies, advertising and promotion, and restaurant depreciation and amortization. Certain of these costs and expenses are variable and will increase or decrease with sales volume. The primary fixed
costs are restaurant management salaries and occupancy costs. Our experience is that when a new restaurant opens, it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize, usually during the first three to six months of
operation. As restaurant management and staff gain experience following a restaurant s opening, labor scheduling, food cost management and operating expense control typically improve to levels similar to those at our more established
restaurants.

     General and Administrative Expenses     
  General and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that provide an infrastructure to
support existing operations and support future growth. Salaries, bonuses, team member benefits, legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees, travel, rent and general insurance are major items in this category. Additionally, we record expense for
Managers In Training ( MIT s ) in this category for approximately six weeks prior to a restaurant opening. We also provide franchise services for which the revenue is included in other revenue and the expenses are included in general
and administrative expenses.      The following table presents items in our unaudited consolidated statements of
operations as a percentage of net restaurant sales or total revenue, as indicated, for the following periods:       

(1)    
    As a percentage of restaurant sales, net      

(2)   
      As a percentage of total revenue      

(3)    
    Restaurant level operating margin is equal to taking restaurant sales, net less restaurant level food and beverage costs, labor and benefit costs,
and operating expenses.         The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes, and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 3, 2016.        Results of Operations   Three and Nine months ended October 2, 2016 compared to Three and Nine months
ended September 27, 2015.          Total Revenue     
  Total revenue of approximately $25.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased approximately $2.4 million, or
8.5%, from $27.9 million for the comparable quarter in fiscal 2015. This year over year decrease was primarily the result of refranchising five Company-owned restaurants. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016, total revenue of approximately
$77.1 million decreased approximately $11.8 million, or 13.2%, from revenue of approximately $88.9 million, for the nine months ended September 27, 2015, primarily as the result of refranchising five Company-owned restaurants.   
    Restaurant Sales, net        Restaurant sales were approximately $21.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $23.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2015, reflecting a 10.0% decrease driven by the
refranchising of five Company-owned restaurant since the third quarter of 2015 and a comparable sales decrease. Comparable sales for Company-owned restaurants open 24 months or more decreased 1.0% compared to a decrease of 9.1% for the same period
in 2015. This reflected a 1.5% comparable sales decline in on-premises sales on a weighted basis, partially offset by a weighted 0.5% increase in catering comparable sales.

   Restaurant sales for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 were
approximately $63.0 million compared to approximately $74.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2015, reflecting a 15.5% decrease. This decline was due to the refranchising of five Company-owned restaurants during the third quarter
of 2015 and a year-to-date comparable restaurant sales decline of 5.1% as compared to a 9.1% decline in the same period of 2015.        Franchise-Related Revenue        Franchise-related revenue
consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees, which include initial franchise fees and area development fees. Franchise-related revenue was approximately $4.3 million for the third quarter of both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting
the net addition of four franchise-operated restaurants, completely offset by a 3.8% comparable sales decline.   
  Franchise-related revenue was approximately $13.3 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 as compared to
$13.5 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to our receipt of $250,000 in area development fees associated with a new international development agreement for the United Arab Emirates during the
nine months ended September 27, 2015 and a year over year decline in royalty revenue.        Licensing and Other Revenue
       Licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business, including sauces, rubs, marinades
and seasonings. Other revenue includes payments for opening assistance and training services that we provide to our franchisees. For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, licensing royalty revenue was approximately $244,000 compared to approximately
$240,000 for the comparable period of fiscal 2015. Licensing royalty revenue was approximately $758,000 for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, as compared to $747,000 for the comparable period of fiscal 2015.   
  Other revenue for the fiscal 2016 third quarter was approximately ($44,000) compared to $5,000 for the comparable prior
year s third quarter. This decrease was due to a timing difference associated with certain reimbursable payments. Other revenue for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 was approximately $26,000, compared to approximately $18,000 for the

     Food and Beverage Costs     
  Food and beverage costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 were approximately $6.5 million or 31.0% of net restaurant
sales, compared to approximately $7.2 million or 31.1% of net restaurant sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This year-over-year percentage decrease was the result of contract deflation. This decrease was almost completely offset by
increases in portion sizes, a shift in product mix as a result of additional menu options, and lower than anticipated vendor rebates.      Food and beverage costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $19.6 million or 31.1% of net restaurant sales compared to approximately $22.8 million or 30.5% of net restaurant sales
for the comparable period of fiscal 2015. This year-over-year percentage increase was the result of increased challenges with protein product yields, increases in portion size, a shift in product mix as a result of the additional affordable menu
options, and lower than anticipated vendor rebates, partially offset by contract deflation.        Labor and Benefits Costs
       Labor and benefits costs for the third quarter ended October 2, 2016 were approximately $7.1
million or 33.7% of net restaurant sales, compared to approximately $8.3 million or 35.7% of net restaurant sales for the three months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease as a percent of net restaurant sales was primarily due to declines in
direct labor costs and open positions in the manager matrix. These decreases were partially offset by wage rate inflation.      Labor and benefits for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 were approximately $21.3 million, or 33.8% of net restaurant sales, compared to approximately $25.0 million, or 33.5% of net restaurant
sales, for the nine months ended September 27, 2015. This increase as a percent of net restaurant sales was due to sales deleverage on fixed labor costs.        Operating Expenses        Operating expenses for the third
quarter of fiscal 2016 were approximately $6.6 million, or 31.5% of net restaurant sales, compared to operating expenses of approximately $7.0 million, or 29.8% of net restaurant sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This increase was the
result of increases in other direct operating expenses and sales deleverage on fixed operating and occupancy costs.      During the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015, advertising as a percentage of net sales was 2.9%. In both periods there was a 1.0% marketing contribution.   
  Operating expenses for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 were approximately $18.7 million, or 29.6% of net
restaurant sales, compared to approximately $21.4 million, or 28.7% of net restaurant sales, for the nine months ended September 27, 2015. This increase as a percentage of sales is the result of sales deleverage on fixed operating costs and
higher supply costs partially offset by a year over year decline in utility and repairs and maintenance costs.   
    Depreciation and Amortization        Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2016 was approximately $909,000, or 3.6% of total revenue, compared to $1.1 million, or 3.8% of total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal
2015. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 was approximately $2.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, and was 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, of total revenue. This
decrease in both dollars and as a percent of revenue is due to the closure and refranchising of Company restaurants.

     Pre-opening Expenses     
  Pre-opening expenses consist of labor, food, utilities, training and occupancy costs incurred prior to the opening of a
new restaurant. Included in pre-opening costs is the cost of rent incurred, if any, prior to the restaurant opening. We did not incur any pre-opening costs during the third quarter of either 2016 or 2015 and during the nine months ended
October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.        Asset Impairment and Estimated Lease Termination and Other Closing
Costs        In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification for
Property, Plant, and Equipment, we evaluate restaurant sites and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of restaurant sites to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the net book value of the restaurant site to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis. If a restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss
is measured by the amount by which the net book value of the restaurant s assets exceeds its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows, expected growth rates in comparable
restaurant sales, remaining lease terms, discount rate and other factors. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to take additional impairment charges for the related assets. Considerable management judgment is necessary to
estimate future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.   
  Following is a summary of asset impairment, estimated lease termination, and other closing costs for the three and nine
months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015:       

(1)    
    Asset impairment calculated at July 3, 2016 related to a software implementation project that was discontinued.      

(2)    
    Asset impairment calculated at June 28, 2015 based upon anticipated sale of Smithtown restaurant.      

(3)    
    Lease termination reserve associated with a letter of credit provided to a landlord for a previously closed restaurant.

(4)    
    Lease termination costs associated with the cancellation of a potential new restaurant location.      

(5)    
    Write off of development costs associated with the cancellation of a potential new restaurant location.      

(6)    
    Includes $191,000 in costs written-off associated with closing the Lombard, Illinois field office partially offset by an $86,000 recapture of
deferred rent credits.          Restaurant Optimization  During the third quarter of
fiscal 2016, the Company recorded approximately $3.4 million in asset impairment charges associated with 11 restaurants which were slow to respond to several initiatives to turnaround operating performance. As a result, the Company determined that
the estimated fair value of the assets was less than the net book value and recognized an impairment charge to reduce the related assets to the estimated fair value. As we continue to evaluate the restaurant portfolio we anticipate addressing the
ongoing operation of the 11 locations impaired over the next 3 years by way of lease restructuring, lease assignment or subsequent closure at the end of their natural lease term.

     General and Administrative Expenses     
  General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $4.5 million, or 17.8% of total
revenue, compared to approximately $4.1 million, or 14.9% of total revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This year over year increase as a percent of revenue was the result of a settlement agreement, costs incurred for franchise related
matters and increased stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by declines in severance and travel costs.      General and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $13.1 million, or 17.0% of total revenue, compared to approximately $13.9 million, or 15.7% of total
revenue, for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. This increase as a percent of revenue was the result of revenue deleveraging, a settlement agreement, and costs incurred for franchise related matters. These increases were partially offset by
professional fees related to brand development which were not repeated in the first nine months of 2016.        Interest
Expense        Interest expense was approximately $210,000, or 0.8% of total revenue, for the third quarter
of fiscal 2016, compared to approximately $218,000, or 0.8% of total revenue, for the comparable fiscal 2015. This category includes interest expense for our term loan, financing lease obligations, line of credit, and interest for deferrals made
under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.      Interest expense was approximately $613,000, or 0.8% of
total revenue, for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 and approximately $641,000, or 0.7% of total revenue, for the first nine months of fiscal 2015.        Provision for Income Taxes        For the third quarter of
2016, we recorded an estimated tax benefit of approximately $1.6 million, or 39.9% of income before income taxes. This compares to an estimated tax expense of approximately $96,000, or 9.1% of income before income taxes, for the third quarter of
2015. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016, our tax benefit was approximately $1.5 million, or 41.7% of income before income taxes. This compares to an estimated tax expense of approximately $440,000, or 22.9% of income before income
taxes, for the nine months ended September 27, 2015.

     Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share     
  Net loss for the three months ended October 2, 2016 was approximately $2.5 million, or ($0.35) per basic and diluted
share, respectively, on approximately 6,950,000 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding. Net income for the three months ended September 27, 2015 was approximately $708,000, or $0.10 per basic and diluted on approximately
6,945,000 weighted average basic shares outstanding and 6,958,000 weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively.      Net loss for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 was approximately $1.5 million, or ($0.21) per basic and diluted share on approximately 6,949,000 weighted average basic and diluted shares
outstanding. Net income for the nine months ended September 27, 2015 was approximately $1.6 million, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share on approximately 7,008,000 weighted average basic shares outstanding and approximately 7,027,000 weighted
average diluted shares outstanding, respectively.       Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Our balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was approximately $6.8 million at October 2, 2016 and
approximately $5.3 million at January 3, 2016.      Our current ratio, which measures our immediate short-term
liquidity, was 0.87 at October 2, 2016 and 1.18 at January 3, 2016. The current ratio is computed by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. The decrease in our current ratio was primarily due to the inclusion of the
line of credit and term loan in current liabilities partially offset by an increase in our cash on hand and restricted cash required for the collateralization of the undrawn letters of credit, as well as declines in liabilities held for sale.
     Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 was approximately
$2.7 million which reflects a net loss of approximately $2.1 million. Included in net loss are non-cash impairment charges of approximately $4.7 million and non-cash depreciation and amortization of $2.8 million. This was offset by a $1.6 million
increase in prepaid and other current assets and a $1.2 million increase in restricted cash.      Net cash provided
by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2015 was approximately $2.1 million, reflecting net income of approximately $1.5 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization of approximately $3.4 million, and non-cash
impairment charges of $1.6 million. These inflows were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accrued compensation and a $1.8 million gain on disposal of property.   
  Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $513,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, reflecting
$1.1 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, offset by $540,000 in capital expenditures. For the first nine months of fiscal 2015, net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately $2.2 million from $5.3 million in proceeds from
the sale of assets, offset by $3.1 million of capital expenditures for our existing restaurants and other infrastructure projects.      Net cash used for financing activities was approximately $2.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Net cash used by financing activities was approximately $4.8 million for the comparable
period in fiscal 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, we made draws of $1.9 million on our line of credit and made repayments of $3.9 million on our long-term debt. During the nine months ended September 27, 2015, we made draws of
$20.7 million on our line of credit and made repayments of $19.3 million. We also used approximately $5.7 million during that period to repurchase 195,899 shares under the May 2012 share repurchase program.

   The Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively known as the
 Borrower ) have a Waiver and Second Amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to their Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the  Credit Agreement ), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as
administrative agent and lender (the  Lender ). The Credit Agreement will mature on December 31, 2017. The borrower is obligated to make monthly payments of $200,000 to reduce the principal amount of the loans. Additionally, the
Borrowers deposited 105% of the face amount of the outstanding letters of credit in a cash collateral account with the Administrative Agent.      At October 2, 2016, the principal amounts outstanding under the Facility and the Term Loans were $1.9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, along with approximately $1.0 million in letters of
credit for real estate locations. The Credit Agreement allows for the termination of the Facility by the Borrower without penalty at any time. Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower has granted the Lender a security interest in all current and
future personal property of the Borrower.      Principal amounts outstanding under the Facility bear interest
either at an adjusted Eurodollar rate or  Base Rate  plus an applicable margin. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, our weighted average interest rate for the Facility was 3.67% and 2.64%,
respectively.      The Facility contains various financial covenants as well as customary affirmative and negative
covenants for credit facilities of this type. For more information regarding the details of the customary affirmative and negative covenants, please refer to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 8, 2015
filed as Exhibit 10.2 to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2015, which was filed on May 8, 2015, the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed on
December 11, 2015, and the Waiver and Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 10, 2016.   
  For the quarter ended October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement except the
Adjusted Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA covenants.      For the quarter ended October 2,
2016 the Adjusted Leverage Ratio was 5.57:1.00, which is higher than the maximum Adjusted Leverage Ration permitted by the Credit Agreement of 5.50:1.00      For the quarter ended October 2, 2016 our Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 million, which is less than the minimum Adjusted EBITDA permitted by the Credit Agreement of $1.5 million for this quarter.
     It is an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement if Borrowers fail to comply with either the Adjusted
Leverage Ratio or minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant or any other covenant. Upon an Event of Default, the Lender has the right to declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans; all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other
amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other loan document to be immediately due and payable, as well as to exercise its other rights as a secured creditor. In addition, we are prohibited under the Credit Agreement from making dividends or
distributions from one Borrower to another Borrower and purchasing common stock pursuant to a board-approved stock purchase program.      On November 9, 2016, the Borrowers and Lender entered into a Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which the Lender agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement
relating to the existing defaults during a Forbearance Period ending December 9, 2016 or on the earlier date of any other Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or breach of the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement we
have agreed not to request and Wells Fargo is not obligated to make any further extensions of credit to us under the Credit Agreement. During the Forbearance Period, we intend to closely manage our expenses and cash balances to prevent a working
capital shortfall. At November 9, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the Facility was $9.9 million, along with approximately $595,000 in letters of credit for real estate locations.   
  During the first nine months of fiscal 2016 the Company generated approximately $2.7 million in cash from operating
activities compared to $2.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. As of October 2, 2016, the Company ended the third quarter with total net debt of approximately $5.8 million. This compares to $11.4 million of net debt as of September
27, 2015.

   During the Forbearance Period the Company intends to finalize its

Item 3.   
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK         Our Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt. Our Company includes as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents investments with original maturities of three
months or less when purchased and which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Our Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments.
We have no derivative financial instruments. Our total outstanding long-term debt as of October 2, 2016 was approximately $13.2 million, including our line of credit, term loan and financing lease obligations. The terms of our credit facility
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lender are discussed above under   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition, Liquidity and
Capital Resources.        Some of the food products purchased by us are affected by commodity pricing and
are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, production problems, delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control. To control this risk in part, we have fixed-priced purchase commitments for food from vendors.
In addition, we believe that substantially all of our food is available from several sources, which helps to control food commodity risks. We have secondary source suppliers for certain items and in 2016 we have continued to make this a key area of
focus in order to protect the supply chain and to ensure a more fair and competitive pricing environment. We believe we have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary the menu options offered, if needed, in response to a food product price
increase.       

Item 4.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.      There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

against a group of former franchisees in California seeking injunctive relief and damages for: (1) Federal Trademark Infringement; (2) Federal Trademark Dilution; (3) Federal Unfair Competition; (4) Federal Trade Dress Dilution;
(5) Trademark Infringement under California Business and Professions Code   14200; (6) Trademark Dilution under California Business and Professions Code  14200; (7) Common Law Trademark Infringement; (8) Unfair
Competition under California Business and Professions Code   17200; (9) False Advertising; (10) Breach of Contract; (11) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and (12) Intentional Interference with
Contract. The claims stem from the former franchisees breaches of their franchise agreements, including the failure to pay franchise fees and their continued operation of five restaurants utilizing Famous Dave s intellectual property without
authorization. After two defendants in the case, Kurt Schneiter and M Mart 1, filed a demurrer to the Complaint, Famous Dave s filed an Amended Complaint on October 9, 2015, reasserting the same claims. The case is captioned Famous
Dave s of America, Inc., v. SR El Centro FD, Inc., et al., Case No. BC589329, and is currently pending before the Honorable Elihu M. Berle in the Superior Court of Los Angeles. By court order, dated June 6, 2016, Famous Dave s
successfully obtained a preliminary injunction, enjoining the former franchisee defendants from using Famous Dave s intellectual property, including its trademarks and restaurant system. The preliminary injunction is currently the subject of a
pending interlocutory appeal which Famous Dave s intends to oppose vigorously.      On July 28, 2015,
these franchisees (the  Plaintiffs ) filed a complaint against Famous Dave s in the South Judicial District of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles. On March 10, 2016, Plaintiffs re-filed this Complaint as a First
Amended Cross-Complaint [Famous Dave s of America, Inc. v. SR El Centro, Inc., et al., Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central Division, Case No. BC589329] alleging that Famous Dave s breached the
Franchise Agreements for these restaurants by failing to provide certain marketing support and access to customer contact data, vendors, internet reporting and support to Plaintiffs, and failing to provide operations and preferred practices training
to Plaintiffs  designated representative. Plaintiffs further allege that such conduct by Famous Dave s is a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs also allege that Famous Dave s aided and abetted John and
Allan Gantes in breach of their fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages in amount not less than $20 million, punitive damages, costs and attorneys  fees.

   For the quarter ended October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with
all covenants of the Credit Agreement except the Adjusted Leverage Ratio and the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA covenant.      For the quarter ended October 2, 2016, the Adjusted Leverage Ratio was 5.57:1.00, which is higher than the maximum Adjusted Leverage Ratio permitted by the Credit Agreement of 5.50:1.00.   
  For the quarter ended October 2, 2016, our Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 million, which is less than the minimum Adjusted
EBITDA permitted by the Credit Agreement of $1.5 million for this quarter.      It is an Event of Default under the
Credit Agreement if Borrowers fail to comply with either the Adjusted Leverage Ratio or Minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant or any other covenant. Upon an Event of Default, the Lender has the right to declare the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding loans; all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other loan document to be immediately due and payable, as well as to exercise its other rights as a secured creditor. In
addition, we are prohibited under the Credit Agreement from making dividends or distributions from one Borrower to another Borrower and purchasing common stock pursuant to a board-approved stock purchase program.   
  On November 9, 2016, the Borrowers and the Lender entered into a Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which the Lender
agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement relating to the existing defaults during a Forbearance Period ending December 9, 2016 or on the earlier date of any other Event of Default under the Credit
Agreement or breach of the Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement, we have agreed not to request and Wells Fargo is not obligated to make any further extensions of credit to us under the Credit Agreement. During the Forbearance
Period, we intend to closely manage our expenses and cash balances to prevent a working capital shortfall. At November 9, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the Facility was $9.9 million, along with approximately $595,000 in letters
of credit for real estate locations.      During the first nine months of fiscal 2016 the Company generated
approximately $2.7 million in cash from operating activities compared to $2.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. As of October 2, 2016, the Company ended the third quarter with total net debt of approximately $5.8 million. This
compares to $11.4 million of net debt as of September 27, 2015.      During the Forbearance Period, the Company
intends to finalize its refinancing arrangement. As a result of the Events of Default at October 2, 2016 and given the length of the Forbearance Period, all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement were classified as current
liabilities.      If we are unable to successfully refinance the Credit Facility during the Forbearance Period,
comply with the other terms of the Credit Agreement, comply with the terms of the Forbearance Agreement or extend the Forbearance Period as needed to successfully complete an amendment or restructuring, Wells Fargo would be entitled to accelerate
and declare due all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. In the event of such acceleration, our available cash would be insufficient to repay all amounts due under the Credit Agreement without obtaining alternative debt financing, equity
financing or a combination thereof.      There can be no assurance that we will comply, successfully refinance or
restructure the Credit Agreement, comply with the terms of the Forbearance Agreement or the Credit Agreement, or successfully negotiation an extension of the Forbearance Period if needed.   
  As a result of the Events of Default at October 2, 2016 and given the length of the Forbearance Period, all
outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement were classified as current liabilities.

 B. The Borrowers have informed the Administrative Agent that they have failed to comply with (i) the Adjusted Leverage
Ratio financial covenant under Section 14.01 of the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2016 (the   Adjusted Leverage Ratio Event of Default  ) and (ii) the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA financial
covenant under Section 14.05 of the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2016 (the   EBITDA Event of Default  , together with the Adjusted Leverage Ratio Event of Default, collectively, the

herein.     AGREEMENT   
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

(b) the aggregate amount of Related Treasury Management Obligations was not less than $16,909.20, which amounts constitute valid and subsisting obligations of the Borrowers to the Lenders that are not subject to any credits, offsets, defenses,

pursuant to the Loan Documents is valid and subsisting and agrees that this Agreement shall in no manner impair or otherwise adversely affect such obligations, Liens or security interests.  

2.  Forbearance . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall, during the Forbearance Period (as defined below), forbear from exercising any and all rights and remedies available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents and applicable law,
but only to the extent that such rights and remedies arise exclusively as a result of the existence of the Acknowledged Events of Default;  provided ,  however , that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be free to exercise any
or all of their rights and remedies arising on account of the Acknowledged Events of Default at any time upon or after the occurrence of a Forbearance Termination Event (as defined below).  
 3.  Forbearance Termination Events . Nothing set forth herein or contemplated hereby is intended to constitute an
agreement by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to forbear from exercising any of the rights available to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Loan Documents or Requirements of Law (all of which rights and remedies are hereby
expressly reserved by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) upon or after the occurrence of a Forbearance Termination Event. As used herein, a   Forbearance Termination Event   shall mean the earliest of the following to occur:

Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or constitute a waiver or amendment of any provision of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except as expressly set forth herein. The breach of any provision or representation under this Agreement shall
constitute an immediate Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, and this Agreement shall constitute a Loan Document.  
 7.  Representations and Warranties . Each of the Borrowers represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent as follows:

Dave s of America, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the    Company   ), and Doug Renegar (   Executive   ). This Agreement shall be effective upon the date of termination of the Company s current Chief
Executive Officer, Adam Wright (   Effective Date   ).    WHEREAS, Executive wishes to be employed by the
Company and the Company desires to employ Executive as its Senior Vice President of Franchise Operations (the    SVP     ) on the terms and conditions set forth herein.  
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:    1.
 Employment; Employment Term . Upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Company hereby agrees to retain the services of Executive and Executive hereby accepts such employment and agrees to faithfully and diligently serve as
directed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the    CEO   ) in accordance with this Agreement, commencing on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to  Section 6  of this Agreement,
continuing until the close of business on the four (4) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the    Employment Term   ).  
 2.  Duties .  
 (a)  Services . During the Employment Term, Executive agrees to serve as SVP of the Company and shall render his duties as
SVP in a manner that is consistent with Executive s position within the Company and as assigned by the CEO. Executive shall perform duties generally typical for a Senior Vice President of Franchise Operations of a publicly traded company with
extensive franchise operations operating and conducting business in the United States and its territories, Canada, Abu Dhabi and such other countries as the Company may conduct operations and do business in during the Employment Term. In addition to
his duties as SVP, if requested by the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ), Executive agrees to serve as an elected/appointed officer of the Company and Executive shall serve in such capacity without additional
