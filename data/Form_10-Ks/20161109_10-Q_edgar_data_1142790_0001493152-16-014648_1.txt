NOTE
1   BASIS OF OPERATIONS   

The
unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The financial statements and notes are presented as permitted on Form
10-Q and do not contain certain information included in the Company s annual statements and notes. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these financial statements
be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2016 Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including the audited financial statements and the
accompanying notes thereto. While management believes the procedures followed in preparing these financial statements are reasonable,
the accuracy of the amounts are in some respects dependent upon the facts that will exist, and procedures that will be accomplished
by the Company later in the year.  

These
unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management,
are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Nature
of Business    

On
October 29, 2013, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Bacterial Robotics, LLC (Bacterial Robotics). Bacterial Robotics
owns certain patents and/or other intellectual property related to the development of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMOs)
and GMOs tailored to perform one or more specific functions, one such GMO being adopted to clean polluting molecules from nuclear
waste, such GMO being referred herein as the existing BactoBot Technology (the BR Technology). Bacterial Robotics is developing
a whitepaper to deliver to the Company for acceptance. Upon acceptance by the Company, the parties will form a strategic relationship
through the formation of a joint venture in which the Company will be the majority and controlling owner which will use the NuclearBot
Technology to further the growth of the nuclear wastewater treatment market. The intent is for Bacterial Robotics to issue a 10-year
license agreement. In connection with the strategic alliance agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 75,000,000 shares
of its common stock valued at $1,100,000 and paid an additional $50,000 in cash. The Company fully impaired this as of March 31,
2014, as there was no value in the agreement, and the Company would not pursue any of the technology associated with the patents.  

On
November 25, 2013, the Company executed a definitive agreement to acquire Pilus Energy, LLC ( Pilus ), an Ohio limited
liability company and a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that creates
electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. Pilus is converging digester, fermenter, scrubber, and other
proven technologies into a scalable Electrogenic Bioreactor ( EBR ) platform. This technology is the basis of the
Pilus Cell . The EBR harnesses genetically enhanced bacteria, also known as bacterial robots, or BactoBots , that
remediate water, harvest direct current ( DC ) electricity, and produce economically important gases. The EBR accomplishes
this through bacterial metabolism, specifically cellular respiration of nearly four hundred carbon and nitrogen molecules. Pilus 
highly metabolic bacteria are non-pathogenic. Because of the mediated biofilm formation, these wastewater-to-value BactoBots resist
heavy metal poisoning, swings of pH, and survive in a 4-to-45-degree Celsius temperature range. Additionally, the BactoBots are
anaerobically and aerobically active, even with low BOD/COD.  

On
January 28, 2014, the acquisition was completed. Pilus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a condition of the
acquisition, Pilus will get one seat on the board of directors, and the shareholders of Pilus will receive a warrant to
purchase 100,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, which represented a fair market value of approximately
$2,000,000. In addition, the Company paid Bacterial Robotics, LLC ( BRLLC ), formerly the parent company of
Pilus, $50,000 on signing the memorandum of understanding and $50,000 at the time of closing. The only asset Pilus had on its
balance sheet at the time of the acquisition was a patent. The Company determined that the value of the acquisition on
January 28, 2014 would be equal to the value of cash paid to Pilus plus the value of the 100,000,000 warrants they issued to
acquire Pilus. Through March 31, 2014, the Company amortized the patent over its estimated useful life, then on March 31,
2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test and determined that the entire unamortized balance should be impaired
as the necessary funding to further develop the patent was not available at that time.  On July 15, 2016, the
Company was notified by its patent attorney, that the maintenance fee is due in the issue of US Patent #
8,354,267. The final deadline to pay the fee to avoid abandonment is January 15, 2017. If the Company does
not make this payment it will lose the patent permanently.

Going
Concern    

As indicated in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses of $903,322 and $251,227 for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management s plans include the raising of capital through equity markets to fund future
operations and cultivating new license agreements or acquiring ownership in technology companies. Failure to raise adequate capital
and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. Additionally, the Company
does not have the financial resources to commercialize the Pilus technology. If it is unable to obtain such resources, it may
be forced to sell all or a portion of the Pilus technology to a third-party. In the event this occurs, there is no guaranty the
consideration received by the Company would be of material benefit to either the Company and/or its shareholders. Even if
the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses, acquire new license agreements or ownership interests
in medical companies and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenues will be sufficient to enable
it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned
Canadian subsidiary, Tauriga Canada, Inc. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Revenue
Recognition    

Revenue
is recognized when realized or realizable, and when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon the shipment of
products.  

Foreign
Currency Translation    

Commencing
with the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be its functional currency. Prior to March 31,
2012, the Company considered the Canadian dollar to be its functional currency. Assets and liabilities were translated into U.S.
dollars at year-end exchange rates. Statement of operations amounts were translated using the average rate during the year. Gains
and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements were included in accumulated other comprehensive gain
or loss, a separate component of stockholders  deficit.  

Cash
Equivalents    

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less. At June 30, 2016, the Company had $6,254 cash at any financial institution which exceeded the total FDIC insurance
limit of $250,000. The Company had no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016. To reduce its risk associated with the failure
of such financial institution, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds
deposits.  

Inventory    

Inventory
consists of raw materials, production in progress and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or market determined by
the first-in, first-out method. The Company sold off all of its segments that had inventory during the year ended March 31, 2016.

Property
and Equipment and Depreciation    

Property
and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets. Routine maintenance, repairs and replacement costs are expensed as incurred and improvements that extend the useful life
of the assets are capitalized. When property and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations.  

Intangible
Assets    

Intangible
assets consisted of licensing fees and a patent prior to being impaired which were stated at cost. Licenses were amortized over
the life of the agreement and patents were amortized over the remaining life of the patent at the date of acquisition.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share    

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) Topic 260 Earnings per Share ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted
EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to Common Stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and Common Stock
equivalents outstanding during the periods; however, potential common shares are excluded for period in which the Company incurs
losses, as their effect is anti-dilutive.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company accounts for Stock-Based Compensation under ASC 718  Compensation-Stock Compensation , which addresses the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement
of cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the
award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant
date must be recognized.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to
Non-Employees. Under ASC 505-50, the Company determines the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted
as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. Any stock options or warrants issued to non-employees are recorded in expense and an offset to additional paid-in
capital in shareholders  equity/(deficit) over the applicable service periods using variable accounting through the vesting
dates based on the fair value of the options or warrants at the end of each period.  

The
Company issues stock to consultants for various services. The costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of
the common stock is measured at the earlier of (1) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to
earn the equity instruments is reached or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. The Company
recognized consulting expense and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services.  

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)    

The
Company has adopted ASC 220 effective January 1, 2012 which requires entities to report comprehensive income (loss) within a continuous
statement of comprehensive income.  

Comprehensive
income (loss) is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of information that historically has
not been recognized in the calculation of net income (loss).

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

Long-lived
assets, primarily fixed assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets might not be recoverable. The Company will perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the
absence of such information or indicators. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline
in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant
adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived
assets to be held and used, the Company would recognize an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through
its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated
fair value.  

Research
and Development    

The
Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $0 for the months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Fair
Value Measurements    

ASC
820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.  

The
following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable:  

Level
1- fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities);  

Level
2- fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and  

Level
3- fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  

Financial
instruments classified as Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets include cash.  

These
condensed consolidated financial instruments are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs
into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment to estimation. Valuations based on unobservable inputs
are highly subjective and require significant judgments. Changes in such judgments could have a material impact on fair value
estimates. In addition, since estimates are as of a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes.
Changes in economic conditions may also dramatically affect the estimated fair values.  

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as
of June 30, 2016 and 2015. The respective carrying value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values due to
the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

Derivatives
are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The conversion features of the convertible debentures
are embedded derivatives and are separately valued and accounted for on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value
recognized during the period of change as a separate component of other income/expense. Fair values for exchange-traded securities
and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. The pricing model we use for determining fair value of our derivatives is the
Monte Carlo Pricing Model. Valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review.
The model uses market-sourced inputs such as interest rates and stock price volatilities. Selection of these inputs involves management s
judgment and may impact net income. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company utilized an expected life ranging from 73
days to 365 days based upon the look-back period of its convertible debentures and notes and volatility of 125%. During the year
ended March 31, 2015, the Company utilized an expected life ranging from 66 days to 325 days based upon the look-back period of
its convertible debentures and notes and volatility in the range of 166% to 196%. As a result of the May 28, 2015, 7% Convertible
Redeemable Note with a principal amount of $104,000 with a maturity date of May 28, 2016 (the  Union Note ) which
contains an anti-rachet clause for the conversion of this Union Note, the Company recorded a derivative liability in the amount
of $200,058 (as a result the entire note was discounted). The also recorded a derivative liability as a result of the July 14,
2015 issuance of a 12% Convertible Redeemable Note with the principal amount of $96,000 issued with an original issue discount
of $16,000. The derivative liability recorded on this note was $152,126 (as a result the entire note was discounted.) As a result
of the issuance of this note containing more beneficial terms of conversion, the Union Note will now be convertible at the lower
of the lesser of (a) sixty percent (60%) multiplied by the lowest closing price as of the date a notice of conversion is given
(which represents a discount rate of forty percent (40%)) or (b) one half penny ($0.005). In the three months ended June 30, 2016,
the Company recognized a loss on the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $107,365 bringing the fair value
of the derivative liability to $782,204. In the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized a loss on the fair value of
the derivative liability in the amount of $277,700.   

Income
Taxes    

Income
taxes are accounted for under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, future tax liabilities
and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts reported in
the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  

Future
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset
is realized or the liability settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on future income tax liabilities and assets is
recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. Future income tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are
considered more likely than not to be realized.  

ASC
740  Income Taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial
statements. This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must
measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.  

As
a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with
recognition and measurement standards established by ASC 740 and concluded that the tax position of the Company does not meet
the more-likely-than-not threshold as of June 30, 2016.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
March 2016, the FASB issues ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) , or ASU No. 2016-09.
The amendments of ASU No. 2016-09 were issues as part of the FASB s simplification initiative focused on improving areas
of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed within
the financial statements. The amendments focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will evaluate the effect of ASU 2016-09 for future periods as applicable.

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying
leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase
by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less
will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and is applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going
Concern  ( ASU No. 2014-15 ). The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every
reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in
this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements
  Going Concern, that outlines management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about
a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The
amendment is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated
financial statements.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation  (ASU 2014-10).
ASU 2014-10 removes all incremental financial reporting requirements regarding development-stage entities, including the removal
of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition, ASU 2014-10 adds an example disclosure in Risks and
Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned operations could provide information
about risks and uncertainties related to the company s current activities. ASU 2014-10 also removes an exception provided
to development-stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity. Effective
with the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, the presentation and disclosure requirements of Topic 915 will
no longer be required. The revisions to Consolidation (Topic 810) are effective the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March
31, 2017. The Company early adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-10 effective for the year ended March 31, 2015.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which
supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific
guidance. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to
obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 will be applied using one of two retrospective methods. The effective
date will be the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. We have not determined the potential effects on our consolidated
financial statements.  

There
are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has
been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or operating results.

License
Agreements:  

Immunovative
Therapies, Ltd.  

On
December 12, 2011, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Immunovative Therapies,
Ltd., an Israeli Corporation ( ITL ), pursuant to which the Company received an immediate exclusive and worldwide
license to commercialize all product candidates (the  Licensed Products ) based on ITL s current and future
patents and a patent in-licensed from the University of Arizona. The license granted covers two experimental products for the
treatment of cancer in clinical development called AlloStim TM and Allo Vaz TM ( Licensed Products ).  

On
January 8, 2013, the Company received from ITL, a notice by which ITL purported to terminate the License Agreement dated December
9, 2011 between the Company and ITL (the  ITL Notice ), along with alleged damages. It is the Company s position
that ITL breached the License Agreement by delivering the ITL Notice and, that prior to the ITL Notice, the License Agreement
was in full force and, on January 17, 2013 and that the Company had complied in all material respect with the License Agreement
therefore the Company believes that there are no damages to ITL. As such, on January 17, 2013, the Company filed a lawsuit against
ITL, which included the request for various injunctive relief against ITL for damages stemming from this breach. On February 19,
2013, the Company and ITL entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties have agreed to the following: (1) the Company
submitted a letter to the Court advising the Court that the parties had reached a settlement and that the Company is withdrawing
its motion, (2) ITL paid the Company $20,000, (3) ITL issued to the Company, ITL s share capital equivalent to 9% of the
issued and outstanding shares of ITL (3,280,000 shares), (4) the Company changed its name and (5) the settling parties agree that
the license agreement is terminated. No value has been assigned to the ITL shares received, as they are deemed to be worthless.
The Company, based upon its evaluation of the ITL financial statement, considered its investment in ITL to be impaired as the
ITL Company had negative net worth and the funds advanced were being utilized for research, development and testing. During the
year ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold the 3,280,000 shares for $125,000 which is recorded in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.  

Green
Hygienics, Inc.  

On
May 31, 2013, the Company executed a licensing agreement with GHI (see Note 1). The Licensing Agreement with GHI will enable the
Company, on an exclusive basis for North America, to market and sell 100% tree-free, bamboo-based, biodegradable, hospital grade
wipes, as well as other similar products to commercial entities including medical facilities, schools, and more. The Company agreed
to pay $250,000 for the licensing rights. In addition, the Company issued 4,347,826 shares of its common stock to GHI whereas
GHI s parent company, Green Innovations Ltd. ( GNIN ) has issued the Company 625,000 shares of common stock
of GNIN, valued at $250,000. The terms of the Licensing Agreement provide for the equal recognition of profits between the Company

Bacterial
Robotics, LLC  

On
October 29, 2013, the Company entered into a strategic alliance agreement between the Company and Bacterial Robotics, LLC (the
Parties) to develop a relationship for the research and development of the NuclearBot Technology that will be marketed and monetized
pursuant to a Definitive Agreement. Accordingly, subject to the terms of this agreement, (a) Bacterial Robotics agreed to develop
a whitepaper which may be delivered as a readable electronic file, on the subject of utilizing the NuclearBot Technology in the

shares of the Company s common stock with a value of $1,139,851 and an additional $25,000 in cash. The Company amortizes
the fee of $1,189,851 over the ten-year life of the licensing agreement, and through March 31, 2014 the accumulated amortization
amounted to $48,952. At March 31, 2014, the Company determined that it was not going to pursue the market nor invest additional
capital to fund the commercialization and accordingly, considered the remaining net value to be impaired recording an impairment
charge of $1,140,899.

On
March 31, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Breathe Ecig Corp. (which has subsequently changed its name

at $100,000, to Breathe for certain licensing rights, as defined in the agreement. Amortization of the license fee will commence
on April 1, 2015 over the two-year term of the agreement (See Note 11). As Breathe is worthless as of the date of this report,
the Company has written off the entire $100,000 value as of March 31, 2015.  

License
agreements consist of the cost of license fees with Breathe Ecig Corp. ($100,000), Green Hygienics, Inc. ($250,000) and Bacterial

NOTE
6   EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company entered into several financial instruments, which consist of notes payable, containing various conversion features. Generally,
the financial instruments are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock; at prices that are either marked to
the volume weighted average price of the Company s intended publicly traded stock or a static price determinative from the
financial instrument agreements. These prices may be at a significant discount to market determined by the volume weighted average
price once the Company completes its reverse acquisition with the intended publicly traded company. The Company for all intent
and purposes considers this discount to be fair market value as would be determined in an arm s length transaction with
a willing buyer.  

The
Company accounts for the fair value of the conversion feature in accordance with ASC 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging; Embedded
Derivatives, which requires the Company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion features as an embedded derivative
contained in the Company s convertible debt and original issue discount notes payable. The Company is required to carry
the embedded derivative on its balance sheet at fair value and account for any unrealized change in fair value as a component
in its results of operations. The Company valued the embedded derivatives using eight steps to determine fair value under ASC
820. (1) Identify the item to be valued and the unit of account. (2) Determine the principal or most advantageous market and the
relevant market participants. (3) Select the valuation premise to be used for asset measurements. (4) Consider the risk assumptions
applicable to liability measurements. (5) Identify available inputs. (6) Select the appropriate valuation technique(s). (7) Make
the measurement. (8) Determine amounts to be recognized and information to be disclosed.  

As
of March 31, 2015, the value of the derivative liability associated with the convertible notes was $90,000 associated with the
Class B warrants issued to Hanover Holdings I, LLC, as the warrants had been converted into shares of common stock during the
three months ended June 30, 2015. As a result of the Union Note which contains an anti-rachet clause, the Company recorded a derivative
liability in the amount of $200,058 (as a result the entire note was discounted). In the three months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company recognized a loss on the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $107,365 bringing the fair value of the
derivative liability to $782,204. In the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized a loss on the fair value of the derivative
liability in the amount of $277,700.

a maturity date of May 28, 2016 (the  Union Note ). The Company received gross proceeds of $100,000 under the Union
Note. The Company granted Union 12,500,000 shares of Company common stock for a commitment fee in consideration of the Union Note.
Pursuant to the terms of the Union Note, at any time Union may convert any principal and interest due to it at a 20% discount
to the lowest closing bid price of Company common stock for the five trading days prior to the conversion notice. Additionally,
the discount will be adjusted on a ratchet basis in the event the Company offers a more favorable discount rate or look-back period
to a third party during the term of the Union Note. Union will not be allowed to convert into shares of common stock that would
result in it beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. The Company may prepay
the amounts under the Union Note as follows: (i) if prepaid within ninety days, the Company must pay a 15% premium on all principal
and interest outstanding and (ii) if prepaid after ninety days but before the one hundred and eighty-one day, the Company must
pay a 30% premium on all principal and interest outstanding. The Company intends to use its best efforts to repay the Union Note
within the first ninety days. The Company agreed to reserve 33,000,000 shares of its common stock to satisfy its obligations under
the Union Note. This reserve will be increased to three times the number of shares of common stock upon the approval of the Company s
stockholders of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. The Company agreed to call a special meeting solely
for such purpose with fifteen days of the Union Note. The $104,000 remains outstanding at June 30, 2016 (reflected as a derivative
liability), and the $4,000 discount was expensed in the three months ended June 30, 2015.

On
June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with various accredited

prior to August 31, 2015, the Company must pay each investor the amount invested plus a 10% premium and (ii) if prepaid after
August 31, 2015 but prior to December 1, 2015, the Company must pay each investor the amount invested plus a 20% premium. In the

which the Company has done. Excluding the 13,300,000 commitment shares, in May 2016 the Company agreed to issue 33,900,000 shares

Non-convertible
Debt Financing  

Alternative
Strategy Partners PTE Ltd.  

On
September 23, 2015, the Company entered into a debt facility of $180,000 in non-convertible debt financing from Singapore-based
institutional investor Alternative Strategy Partners PTE Ltd. ( ASP ). The debt carries a fixed interest rate per
annum of 11.50% ( the Designated Rate ) payable in full by December 23, 2015 ( the Maturity Date ). Both
parties have discussed the possibility of amending terms, if necessary, under the assumption that both parties mutually agree
to such amendment. The Company received cash from the note of $90,000 ($75,000 wired directly to the Company and $15,000 wired
directly from ASP to compensate a consultant).  

The
balance of this $180,000 or the other $90,000 was to be wired directly to a Japanese based consumer product firm called Eishin,
Inc., but there was never any documentation provided to support this $90,000. The Company is in dispute with the noteholder, and
has not recorded this liability as of June 30, 2016. If the proper documentation is provided to the Company, they will record
the liability at that time.  

The
Company had entered into an agreement to acquire common shares equivalent to 20.1% of Eishin Co., Ltd. ( Eishin ),
a high growth Japan-based company focusing on providing solutions to improve automobile combustion efficiency.  Eco-Spray ,
Eishin s key product made from 100% natural ingredients, is distributed in numerous Asian markets including China, Japan,
Korea, India, UAE, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines and Myanmar, and is currently being tested for expansion in North America.
The Company has agreed to make an investment in Eishin for a total of $180,000, of which half was paid on October 1, 2015 and
the remainder to be paid by the end of October 31, 2015. The initial $90,000 that was to be used to purchase 20.1% ownership of
Eishin was never funded by ASP and the shares were never transferred. Additionally, the Company did not invest any other funds
to acquire any ownership in Eishin.  

The
Company has not received any type of default notice with respect to this $180,000 non-convertible debenture. Additionally, the
Company has not received any shares in Eishin Co., Ltd. up to this point. The Company is currently in discussions with ASP to
amend the original terms of this non-convertible debenture. Specifically, to reduce the face value of this note from $180,000
to $90,000 and forgo receipt of any shares of Eishin Co., Ltd.  

Lastly
on October 9, 2015, ASP Managing Director (Yuhi Horiguchi) notified the Company via email that any and all warrants that had been
previously mentioned in the $180,000 note were fully cancelled. So there are no warrants in existence, in accordance with this
$180,000 non-convertible debenture. Nor have there been any defaults that ASP has notified the Company.  

Interest
expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $22,233 compared to the same period in the prior year of $4,801, respectively.
Accrued interest at June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 was $82,183 and $86,812, respectively.

Company is authorized to issue 2,500,000,000 shares of its common stock. Effective June 30, 2016, 1,341,270,933 shares of common
stock are outstanding.  

On
July 9, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors ( BOD ) approved an amendment to the Company s Articles
of Incorporation to increase the Company s authorized common stock from 1,000,000,000 to 2,500,000,000 shares and on July

On
June 27, 2014, $250,000 in cash was released from escrow pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with Hanover Holdings I,

1) and filing of a registration statement registering Company securities, whereby the Company agreed to issue shares of its common
stock under a Class A and Class B warrant, as defined in the amended agreement. The Class A warrant provided for a fixed exercise
price of $0.05 per share; the Class B warrant provided for an initial exercise price of $0.05, however, upon a drop of the market
price below $0.05 based on the closing price of the Company s common stock for a period of three consecutive trading days,
the Class B warrant shall carry a call option premium of 135% and shall require payment of the shares within 5 business days in
the form of either cash or a conversion into shares of the Company s common stock based on the closing share price on the
three days prior. As the securities purchase agreement was entered into in anticipation of the Honeywood acquisition and the filing
of a registration statement, neither of which occurred, the Company and Hanover I informally have agreed to regard the $250,000
investment as an exercise under the terms of the Class B warrant. As a result, shares of Company common stock are to be issued,
based on the call option premium amount of $337,500, upon the request of Hanover I. During the year ended March 31, 2015, 12,211,400

Lawsuit
Filed Against Cowan Gunteski   Co. PA    

On
November 4, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against its predecessor audit firm Cowan Gunteski   Co. PA in Federal Court
  Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) entitled  Tauriga Sciences, Inc. v. Cowan, Gunteski   Co., P.A. et
al , Case No. 0:15-cv-62334. The case has since been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey. The case alleges, among other things, that Cowan Gunteski committed malpractice with respect to the audit of the Company s
FY 2014 financial statements (as illustrated in the PCAOB Public Censure of July 23, 2015) and then misrepresented to the Company
with respect about its ability to re-issue an independent opinion for FY 2014 financial statements. On July 31, 2015, the Company
was delisted from the OTCQB Exchange to the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier due to its inability to file its FY 2015 Form 10K.
The lawsuit was expected by the Company and its counsel to take up to 18 months to complete, from the date it was filed (November
4, 2015).  

The
Company in its lawsuit seeks damages against Cowan Gunteski (and its malpractice insurance policy) exceeding $4,000,000. There
is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this lawsuit.  

Subsequent
to the filing of the lawsuit, the Company was notified that the lawsuit was temporarily suspended so that the Company and Cowan
can attempt to mediate this case based on the engagement letters between the parties. On December 30, 2015, the Company was notified
that Daniel F. Kolb was appointed as the mediator.  

Mediation
commenced on February 3, 2016. During these efforts, the Company had been offered settlement amounts, but none that have been
satisfactory.  

On
March 22, 2016 the Company decided that its good faith efforts to settle its ongoing litigation with Cowan Gunteski   Co.
P.A. have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously agreed to proceed forward with the
litigation. The Company is continuing to seek the assistance of independent experts, to help ascribe dollar amounts for certain
damages suffered by the Company ( provable damages ). At this point in time, the Company has realized out of pocket
cash losses and liabilities (inclusive of liquidated damages) that exceed $850,000. Additional potential damages include but are
not limited to: inability to properly maintain Pilus Energy s Intellectual Property ( Pilus IP ), the July 31,
2015 delisting of the Company shares from OTCQB to Pink Sheets, loss of market capitalization ( market cap ), loss
of trading liquidity ( trading volume ), and loss of substantial business opportunities. In aggregate the Company
intends to seek monetary award(s), during trial, in excess of $4,000,000. That figure is expected to continually increase as additional
time lapses.  

On
September 29, 2016, the judge presiding over the case approved the ruled on the two outstanding motions filed on June 13, 2016.
The motion to transfer the case to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was approved, however the judge
denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Depositions have commenced in this case.

Notes Payable (Continued)    

Group
10 Holdings LLC   Note dated November 7, 2016 (Continued)  

On
November 7, 2016, the Company entered into a $45,000 convertible debenture with OID in the amount of $7,000 with Group 10 Holdings
LLC. Along with this note, 8,000,000 commitment shares must be issued to the holder within 15 days or an event of default will

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The
following Business Overview and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations describes
the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying quarterly unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended March 31, 2016 ( Annual Report ).
Our Annual Report includes additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that
underlie our financial results, as well as a detailed discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties associated with
our financial and operating results.  

Business
Overview   

On
October 29, 2013 the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance with Synthetic Biology Pioneer Bacterial Robotics LLC to Develop
and Commercialize Industry Specific Bacterial Robots  BactoBots . Under terms of the Agreement the companies will
jointly develop a nuclear industry-specific Bacterial Robot ( BactoBots(TM) ). BactoBots are ubiquitous microscopic
robots applicable to therapeutics, wastewater, and chemicals. Specifically, Bacterial Robotics owns a family of intellectual property
beginning with U.S Patent # 8,354,267 B2 that relates generally to genetically enhanced bacteria that conduct specific functions.
Bacterial Robotics initial focus with Tauriga is developing a proprietary BactoBot to remediate wastewater generated by nuclear
energy production. On July 15, 2016, the Company was notified by its patent attorney, that the maintenance fee is due in the issue
of US Patent # 8,354,267. The final deadline to pay the fee to avoid abandonment is January 15, 2017. If the Company does not
make this payment it will lose the patent permanently.  

On
November 25, 2013, the Company entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cincinnati, Ohio based Pilus Energy LLC ( Pilus
Energy ), a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that creates electricity
while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, which has been unanimously
ratified by Tauriga s board of directors, Pilus Energy will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tauriga. In addition, certain
advisors of Pilus Energy will be incorporated into the existing management team of Tauriga and will report directly to the Company s
Chief Executive Officer. A total of $100,000 was paid by Tauriga to Bacterial Robotics in connection with the execution of this
November 2013 definitive agreement for the acquisition of Pilus Energy.  

On
January 28, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Cincinnati, Ohio based synthetic biology pioneer Pilus Energy LLC ( Pilus
Energy ). Structurally Pilus Energy will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Tauriga (pursuant to the terms of the definitive
agreement) and will maintain its headquarters location in the State of Ohio. The management of Pilus Energy will report directly
to both the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) of Tauriga with the expectation
that at least one board seat of Tauriga will be allocated to a Pilus Energy affiliate. The Board of Directors of Tauriga Sciences
unanimously approved both the previously announced definitive merger agreement on October 25, 2013 as well as the completion of
the acquisition inclusive of amended closing terms. In consideration for early closing of this acquisition, shareholders of Pilus
Energy received a warrant to purchase 100,000,000 shares of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. common stock at $0.02 per share.  

Pilus
Energy utilizes a proprietary clean technology to convert industrial customer  wastewater  into value. This wastewater-to-value
( WTV ) proposition provides customers with substantial revenue-generating and cost-saving opportunities. Pilus Energy
is converging digester, fermenter, scrubber, and other proven legacy technologies into a single scalable Electrogenic Bioreactor
( EBR ) platform. This transformative microbial fuel cell technology is the basis of the Pilus Cell(TM). The EBR harnesses
genetically enhanced bacteria, also known as bacterial robots, or BactoBots(TM), that remediate water, harvest direct current
(DC) electricity, and produce economically important gases and chemicals. The EBR accomplishes this through bacterial metabolism,
specifically cellular respiration of nearly four hundred carbon and nitrogen molecules typically called pollutants in wastewater.
Pilus Energy s highly metabolic bacteria are non-pathogenic. Because of the mediated biofilm formation, these wastewater-to-value
BactoBots(TM) resist heavy metal poisoning, swings of pH, and survive in a 4-to-45-degree Celsius temperature range. Additionally,
the BactoBots(TM) are anaerobically and aerobically active, even with low biological oxygen demand ( BOD ) and chemical
oxygen demand ( COD ). Currently, the Company does not have the financial resources to commercialize the Pilus
technology.  If it is unable to obtain such resources, it may be forced to sell all or a portion of the Pilus technology
to a third-party. In the event this occurs, there is no guaranty the consideration received by the Company would be of material
benefit to either the Company and/or its shareholders.  

On
March 26, 2014, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Pilus Energy LLC ( Pilus Energy ) has commenced
a five-phase, $1,700,000 USD commercial pilot test ( commercial pilot ) with the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ),
utilizing Chicago Bridge   Iron Co. (NYSE:CBI) ( CB I ) Federal Services serving as the third-party-contractor
through the EPA s Test and Evaluation ( T E ) facility. This five phase commercial pilot will include significant
testing of the Pilus Energy Electrogenic Bioreactor ( EBR ) synthetic biology platform for generating value from wastewater.
This commercial pilot is of great importance to the Company, because it represents the scale up from the benchtop (laboratory)
scale to commercial (industrial) scale. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati ( MSDGR ), which is
co-located with EPA s T E facility, will host the commercial scale EBR prototype at its main treatment plant in Cincinnati.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Three
and months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015    

Revenue.
 The Company was currently developing its business and as a result it had not developed a material or consistent pattern of
revenue generation. In addition, and as discussed further below, the business was disposed of in August 2015. For the three months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not generate any revenue compared to $40,476 revenue for the three months ended June 30,
2015.  

The
revenue was generated from the Company s natural wellness cannabis compliment line launched in August of 2014. The Company
disposed of operations on August 7, 2015. There is no guaranty that a new line of business will result in material revenue production.  

Cost
of Goods Sold . The Company s cost of goods sold for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0, which resulted no gross
profit for that period compared to cost of goods sold of $7,492 and a gross margin of $32,804 or 80.5% for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The difference was due to the disposition of operations in the second fiscal quarter of 2016.  

General
and Administrative Expenses.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $766,810 compared
to $282,141 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to stock issued for services rendered
under consulting agreements in the amount of $557,200.  

Other
Income (Expense) . For the three months ended June 30, 2016, other expense was $129,598 compared to other income $26,786 for
the same period in the prior fiscal year. This largest item in the three months ended June 30, 2016 was change in derivative liability
resulting an expense of $107,365.  

Net
Loss . For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated net loss of $903,322 compared to $251,227 for the same
period in the prior fiscal year. The increased loss was primarily due to stock issued for services rendered under consulting agreements
in the amount of $557,200.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
continue to fund our operations through private placement offerings and other financings.  

During
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold 27,250,000 shares of common stock raising $292,000. The shares were issued
by the Company in the first and third fiscal quarters of 2017.  

At
June 30, 2016, we had $6,254 of cash or cash equivalents as compared to $0 at March 31, 2016.  

Cash
Flows   

Net
cash used in operating activities amounted to $284,474 and $127,270 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we used no cash in investing activities.  

During
the three months ended June 30, 2016, we had $290,728 cash provided by financing activities compared to $3,000 provided in the
same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of shares issued for cash in 2016 of $292,000. In 2015, the Company
received proceeds of $133,000 in notes payable from individuals and companies (of which $18,000 was from a related party) and
$100,000 from a convertible debenture, offset by a payment of $230,000 to settle an agreement with another financing institution.  

We
do not believe that our cash on hand at June 30, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our current working capital requirements as we
try to develop a new business line. We will continue to seek additional equity financing. However, there is no assurance that
we will be successful in our equity private placements or if we are that the terms will be beneficial to our shareholders.  

Going
Concern Qualifications   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no revenue and
net losses of $903,322 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to sales of $40,746 and net loss of $251,227 for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $52,716,115 and there are existing uncertain conditions
which the Company faces relative to its obtaining financing and capital in the equity markets. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is highly dependent on its ability to continue
to obtain investment capital from future funding opportunities to fund the current and planned operating levels. The unaudited
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to bring in income generating
activities and its ability to continue receiving investment capital from future funding opportunities. No assurance can be given
that the Company will be successful in these efforts.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term  disclosure controls and procedures  to mean a company s
controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure
that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information
required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive and chief financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have determined that the Company continues to have the following deficiencies which represent a material weakness:  

1.  
      The
    Company does not have an Audit Committee;   

2.  
      Lack
    of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting accounting issues surrounding
    certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will
    continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;   

3.  
      Insufficient
    personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting;
    and   

4.  
      Insufficient
    written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.   

To
remediate our internal control weaknesses, management would need to implement the following measures:  

The
    Company would need to add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and will form an Audit Committee with a
    qualified person to chair the committee.   

The
    Company has hired a chief financial officer, but would need to add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties
    and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.    

The
    Company would need to staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting.    

Upon
                                         the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company would develop and maintain
                                         adequate written accounting policies and procedures.  

Currently,
management does not have the resources nor will it in the near to mid-term future to accomplish these goals.  

The
additional hiring is contingent upon the Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results
of its operations. Management expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able
to do so.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Except
as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered
by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls    

The
Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further,
the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

From
time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.
As of November 3, 2016, there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect
on the results of our operations except as set forth below:  

Lawsuit
Filed Against Cowan Gunteski   Co. PA  

On
November 4, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against its predecessor audit firm Cowan Gunteski   Co. PA in Federal Court
  Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) entitled  Tauriga Sciences, Inc. v. Cowan, Gunteski   Co., P.A. et
al , Case No. 0:15-cv-62334. The case has since been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey. The case alleges, among other things, that Cowan Gunteski committed malpractice with respect to the audit of the Company s
FY 2014 financial statements (as illustrated in the PCAOB Public Censure of July 23, 2015) and then misrepresented to the Company
with respect about its ability to re-issue an independent opinion for FY 2014 financial statements. On July 31, 2015, the Company
was delisted from the OTCQB Exchange to the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier due to its inability to file its FY 2015 Form 10K.
The lawsuit was expected by the Company and its counsel to take up to 18 months to complete, from the date it was filed (November
4, 2015).  

The
Company in its lawsuit seeks damages against Cowan Gunteski (and its malpractice insurance policy) exceeding $4,000,000. There
is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this lawsuit.  

Subsequent
to the filing of the lawsuit, the Company was notified that the lawsuit was temporarily suspended so that the Company and Cowan
can attempt to mediate this case based on the engagement letters between the parties. On December 30, 2015, the Company was notified
that Daniel F. Kolb was appointed as the mediator.  

Mediation
commenced on February 3, 2016. During these efforts, the Company had been offered settlement amounts, but none that have been
satisfactory.  

On
March 22, 2016 the Company decided that its good faith efforts to settle its ongoing litigation with Cowan Gunteski   Co.
P.A. have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously agreed to proceed forward with the
litigation. The Company is continuing to seek the assistance of independent experts, to help ascribe dollar amounts for certain
damages suffered by the Company ( provable damages ). At this point in time, the Company has realized out of pocket
cash losses and liabilities (inclusive of liquidated damages) that exceed $850,000. Additional potential damages include but are
not limited to: inability to properly maintain Pilus Energy s Intellectual Property ( Pilus IP ), the July 31,
2015 delisting of the Company shares from OTCQB to Pink Sheets, loss of market capitalization ( market cap ), loss
of trading liquidity ( trading volume ), and loss of substantial business opportunities. In aggregate the Company
intends to seek monetary award(s), during trial, in excess of $4,000,000. That figure is expected to continually increase as additional
time lapses.  

On
September 29, 2016, the judge presiding over the case approved the ruled on the two outstanding motions filed on June 13, 2016.
The motion to transfer the case to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was approved, however the judge
denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Depositions have commenced in this case.  

Arbitration
  Cherry Baekert LLP  

On
November 23, 2015, the Company had its arbitration date in Miami, Florida at the law office of Pollack, Pollack and Kogan against
Cherry Baekert LLP (a consultant of the Company). This arbitration was concerning outstanding invoices of $31,280 that Cherry
Baekert believed was owed from the Company pursuant to two separate engagement letters entered into in 2014. Prior to November
23, 2015, the Company had already paid $25,000 to Cherry Baekert pursuant to these above mentioned agreements.  

The
arbitrator, Lawrence Saichek, ruled against the Company on December 29, 2015 awarding Cherry Baekert the full $31,280 plus legal
fee reimbursement, and court costs reimbursed. The total award was $47,568. Since that time, the number has grown to $51,387.
On April 25, 2016, the Company made a $15,000 payment to Cherry Baekert towards this outstanding amount. Therefore, the remaining
balance is now $36,387. In addition, Cherry Baekert, as a good faith measure, granted the Company until June 30, 2016 to pay the
balance. There can be no guarantees that the Company will be able to meet that deadline. The Company wired the final amount due
on June 28, 2016.

2.2

Interest shall accrue and be payable on the full Principal Amount of the Debenture, inclusive of the OID, and payment of the full
Principal Amount shall be required regardless of time and manner of payment or prepayment by Borrower. Upon conversion, Holder
shall receive credit for the full Principal Amount converted.  

2.3
 Payments . Payment of the aggregate Principal Amount, together with all accrued interest thereon shall be made on the Maturity
Date.  

2.4
 Prepayment Option . Subject to the approval of Holder for prepayments after one hundred eighty (180) days, Borrower may
prepay in cash all or any portion of the Principal Amount of this Debenture and accrued interest thereon, with a premium, as set

Shares will be returned in the event that this Debenture is prepaid. Failure to issue and deliver the Commitment Fee Shares to

ARTICLE
III 
CONVERSION REPAYMENT  

3.1.
 Optional Conversion . Subject to the terms of this Article III, Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, at
any time after the Issuance Date and until the Maturity Date, or thereafter during an Event of Default, to convert all or any
portion of the outstanding Principal Amount, accrued interest and fees due and payable thereon into fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock of Borrower at the Conversion Price, as defined below (the   Conversion Shares  ).  

3.2.
 Calculation of Conversion Price . Subject to Section 3.2.1 and 4.6 hereof, the conversion price (the   Conversion

a Notice of Conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of forty percent (40%)) or (b) three-tenths of a penny ($0.003)  

3.2.1
 Conversion Price Adjustments.  Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments:  

i.  
      If
    the market capitalization of the Borrower is less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) on the day immediately prior to the
    date of the Notice of Conversion, then the Conversion Price shall be twenty-five percent (25%) multiplied by the Lowest Closing
    Price as of the date a Notice of Conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of seventy-five percent (75%)); and   

ii.  
      If
    the closing price of the Borrower s Common Stock on the day immediately prior to the date of the Notice of Conversion
    is less than two-tenths of a penny ($0.002) then the Conversion Price shall be twenty-five percent (25%) multiplied by the
    Lowest Closing Price as of the date a Notice of Conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of seventy-five percent
    (75%)).   

3.3.
 Conversion Limitation . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the number of Conversion Shares that
may be acquired by Holder upon conversion of this Debenture (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall be limited to the extent necessary
to ensure that, following such conversion (or other issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned
by Holder and its affiliates and any other Persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with that of
Holder for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act does not exceed 4.99% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares
of Common Stock, including, for such purpose, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, but excluding the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon (a) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Principal Amount of this Debenture beneficially
owned by Holder or any of its affiliates and (b) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other
securities of Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including,
without limitation, any other debenture or warrant) beneficially owned by Holder or any of its affiliates. For such purposes,
beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.  

3.4.
 Mechanics of Holder s Conversion . Subject to Section 3.3 hereof, this Debenture may be converted by Holder, in whole
or in part from time to time after the Issuance Date, by submitting to Borrower and/or the transfer agent of record a notice of
conversion (  Notice of Conversion  ), the form of which is attached hereto as  Exhibit A . Such Notice
of Conversion shall specify the Principal Amount of the Debenture to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall
be effected (the   Conversion Date  ). Pursuant to the terms of the Notice of Conversion, Borrower shall issue
instructions to the transfer agent within two (2) Trading Days from the receipt of the Notice of Conversion and shall cause the
transfer agent to transmit the certificates representing the Conversion Shares to Holder by physical delivery or crediting the
account of Holder s designated broker with the Depository Trust Corporation (  DTC  ) through its Deposit
Withdrawal Agent Commission (  DWAC  ) system within two (2) Trading Days after receipt by Borrower of the Notice
of Conversion (the   Delivery Date  ). In the case of the exercise of the conversion rights set forth herein,
the conversion privilege shall be deemed to have been exercised, and the Conversion Shares issuable upon such conversion shall
be deemed to have been issued, upon the Delivery Date and Holder shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such
Common Stock, unless Holder provides Borrower with written instructions to the contrary. Conversions hereunder shall have the
effect of lowering the outstanding Principal Amount of this Debenture in an amount equal to the applicable conversion. Holder
and Borrower shall maintain records showing the Principal Amount(s) converted and the Conversion Date(s). In the event of any
dispute or discrepancy, the records of Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error.  

3.5.
 Conversion Mechanics . The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Debenture shall be
determined by dividing that portion of the Principal Amount and interest and fees to be converted, if any, by the then applicable
Conversion Price.  

3.6
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Debenture. As to any fraction of a
share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to upon such conversion, Borrower shall round up to the next whole share.  

3.7
 Late Delivery of Conversion Shares . Borrower understands that a delay in the delivery of Conversion Shares in the form
required pursuant to this Article III beyond the Delivery Date could result in economic loss to Holder. As compensation to Holder
for such loss, Borrower agrees to pay late fees to Holder for late issuance of such shares in the form required pursuant to this
Article III upon conversion of the Debenture, in the amount equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per Business Day after the
Delivery Date. Borrower shall pay any fees incurred under this Section in immediately available funds upon demand and such fees
shall also be eligible to be converted into Common Stock pursuant to this Article III.  

3.8
 Authorized and Reserved Shares . Borrower represents and warrants and covenants and agrees that upon issuance, the Conversion
Shares will be duly and validly issued, fully issued and non-assessable. Borrower agrees that its issuance of this Debenture shall
constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute
and issue the necessary certificates for Conversion Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Debenture. At all
times during which this Debenture is outstanding, Borrower shall reserve and keep available from its authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock (the   Share Reserve  ) for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Debenture and
payment of interest on this Debenture, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual or contingent
purchase rights of Persons other than Holder, not less than five times the aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock that
shall be issuable (taking account the adjustments of Article IV) upon the conversion of the outstanding Principal Amount of this
Debenture and payment of interest hereunder. Initially, the Share Reserve shall be equal to one hundred fifty million (150,000,000)
shares. The Holder may request bi-monthly increases to reserve such amounts based on a conversion price equal to the Lowest Closing
Price, as defined in the Debenture, as of such date, by written instructions from the Holder to the Transfer Agent to comply with
the required reserve. Borrower agrees that it will take all such reasonable actions as may be necessary to assure that the Conversion
Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the applicable
Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. Borrower agrees to provide Holder with confirmation evidencing the execution
of such share reservation within fifteen (15) Business Days from the Issuance Date.  

3.9
 Issuance of New Debenture . Upon any partial conversion of this Debenture, a new Debenture containing the same date and
provisions of this Debenture shall, at the request of Holder, be issued by Borrower to Holder for the principal balance of this
Debenture and accrued interest which shall not have been converted or paid. Subject to the provisions of Article VI, Borrower
will pay no costs, fees or any other consideration to Holder for the production and issuance of a new Debenture.  

3.10
 Par Value; Further Assurances .  

(a)
Borrower covenants that during the period that the Principal Amount of this Debenture and any accrued interest and fees thereon
remain outstanding, it will ensure that the par value of any Conversion Shares shall not exceed the amount payable therefor upon
such exercise immediately prior to such exercise. Borrower further covenants that it shall take all appropriate actions, including,
without limitation, amending its articles or certificate of incorporation and any other voluntary action, such as calling a meeting
of stockholders to approve any such amendment, to ensure that the amount payable for any Conversion Shares shall at all times
exceed the par value thereof by at least four hundred percent (400%).  

(b)
Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by Holder, Borrower shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its articles or certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms of this Debenture, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the
taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Debenture against
impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower will (a) not increase the par value of any Conversion Shares
above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such exercise, (b) take all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order that Borrower may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Conversion Shares upon the exercise
of this Debenture and (c) use its commercially best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any
public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable Borrower to perform its obligations under this
Debenture.  

3.11
 Transfer Taxes . The issuance of certificates for Conversion Shares shall be made without charge to Holder for any documentary
stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates, provided that Borrower shall
not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such
certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of Holder and Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates
unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to Borrower the amount of such tax or shall

ARTICLE
IV 
CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS  

4.1
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If Borrower, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding: (a) pays a stock dividend
or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock
equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by Borrower upon conversion of,
or payment of interest on, this Debenture); (b) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares;
or (c) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of Borrower, then
the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding
any treasury shares of Borrower) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and
shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.  

4.2
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . If Borrower, at any time within six (6) months of the Issuance Date, shall issue rights, options
or warrants to all holders of Common Stock (and not to Holder) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock
at a price per share that is lower than the Lowest Closing Price on the record date referenced below, then the Conversion Price
shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the
date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase,
and of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights
or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares issued (assuming delivery
to Borrower in full of all consideration payable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants) would purchase at such Lowest
Closing Price. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights or warrants are issued, other than to officers and directors
under equity incentive plans approved by the board of directors, and shall become effective immediately after the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants.  

4.3
 Pro Rata Distributions . If Borrower, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding, distributes to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants to
subscribe for or purchase any security (other than the Common Stock, which shall be subject to Section 4.1), then in each such
case the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date
fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be
the Lowest Closing Price determined as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such Lowest Closing
Price on such record date less the then fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness
so distributed applicable to one (1) outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the board of directors of Borrower
in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement delivered to Holder describing the portion of
assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one (1) share of Common Stock. Such
adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned
above.  

4.4
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Debenture is outstanding, (a) Borrower effects any merger or consolidation
of Borrower with or into another Person, (b) Borrower effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, (c) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by Borrower or another Person) is completed
pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property,
or (d) Borrower effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common
Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a   Fundamental
Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Debenture, Holder shall have the right to receive, for each
Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction,
the same kind and amount of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such
Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, holder of one (1) share of Common Stock
(the   Alternate Consideration  ). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price
shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable
in respect of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and Borrower shall apportion the Conversion Price
among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate
Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction, then Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this
Debenture following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor
to Borrower or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to Holder a new Debenture consistent with the foregoing
provisions and evidencing Holder s right to convert such Debenture into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement
pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to
comply with the provisions of this Section 4.4 and insuring that this Debenture (or any such replacement security) will be similarly
adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.  

4.5
 Calculations . All calculations under this Article III shall be made to four decimal places or the nearest 1/100th of a
share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Article III, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of Borrower) issued
and outstanding.  

4.6
 Notice to Holder .  

a)
 Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Article IV,
Borrower shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth
a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  

b)
 Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (i) Borrower shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form)
on the Common Stock, (ii) Borrower shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock,
(iii) Borrower shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (iv) the approval of any stockholders of Borrower shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which Borrower is a party, any sale
or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Borrower, of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is
converted into other securities, cash or property or (v) Borrower shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of Borrower, then, in each case, Borrower shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained
for the purpose of conversion of this Debenture, and shall cause to be delivered to Holder at its last address as it shall appear
upon Borrower s books and records, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating (A) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption,
rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled
to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (B) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it
is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities,
cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided
that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the
corporate action required to be specified in such notice. Holder is entitled to convert this Debenture during the 20-day period
commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice.  

4.7
 Most Favored Nations Status . So long as this Debenture is outstanding, upon any issuance by Borrower or any of its subsidiaries
of any security (in an amount under one million dollars ($1,000,000)) with any term more favorable to the holder of such security
or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to Holder in this Debenture, then Borrower
shall notify Holder of such additional or more favorable term and such term, at Holder s option, shall become a part of
the transaction documents with Holder. Such more favorable terms include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion
discounts, conversion look-back periods, interest rates, original issue discounts, stock sale price, private placement price per
share and warrant coverage.  

4.8
 Holder s Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of either of the following events, Holder may provide the transfer agent
with written instructions to increase the Share Reserve in accordance therewith: (a) closing price of Borrower s Common
Stock is less than $0.002 for three (3) consecutive Trading Days; or (b) Borrower s issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock is greater than seventy of their authorized shares. Then the Share Reserve shall increase to the number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the five (5) times the value of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest thereon as of such date
divided by the Conversion Price on such date.

but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become,
at Holder s election, immediately due and payable in cash in the sum of (a) one hundred eighteen percent (118%) of the outstanding
Principal Amount of this Debenture plus one hundred percent (100%) of accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (b) all other amounts,

Debenture. Upon the payment in full of the Mandatory Default Amount, Holder shall promptly surrender this Debenture to or as directed

demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and Holder may immediately and without expiration of any grace period enforce any
and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law. Such acceleration may
be rescinded and annulled by Holder at any time prior to payment hereunder and Holder shall have all rights as a holder of his

 Piggyback Registration Rights . Borrower shall include on the next registration statement Borrower files with the SEC (or

of this Debenture, but not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), being immediately due and payable to Holder at its
election in the form of cash payment or addition to the balance of this Debenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
a registration statement is filed with respect to an underwritten offering or a selling stockholder registration statement relating
solely to holders of Borrower s Common Stock who paid cash for such Common Stock in a sale placed by an independent placement
agent, the number of shares of Common Stock owned by Holder to be included in any such registration statement may be limited if
in the opinion of the underwriter or placement agent, the sale of such shares by Holder would adversely impact the sale of shares
by the underwriter or selling stockholders included therein.

 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of Holder hereof in the exercise of any power, right
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or

arbitration, may be awarded to the prevailing party, in the discretion of the arbitrator, or may be apportioned between the parties
in any manner deemed appropriate by the arbitrator. Unless and until the arbitrator decides that one party is to pay for all (or
