ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     Concrete Leveling Services,  Inc. "CLS" was incorporated on August 28, 2007
in the State of Nevada. The Company's principal offices are located at 5046 East
Boulevard  Northwest,  Canton,  Ohio 44718.  In Ohio,  the Company does business
under the trade name of CLS  Fabricating,  Inc.  Its  telephone  number is (330)
966-8120. CLS has never declared bankruptcy,  it has never been in receivership,
and it has never  been  involved  in any  legal  action  or  proceedings.  Since
becoming incorporated, CLS has made no significant purchases that would create a
future  liability  for the  Company.  It has not sold any assets nor has it been
involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations.

     CLS is an operating company that fabricates and markets a concrete leveling
service unit utilized in the concrete  leveling  industry.  This unit secures to
the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a
pumping device  capable of pumping the mixture under  pressure into  pre-drilled
holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.

     There are  other  concrete  leveling  service  units of a  similar  nature,
currently being  manufactured  in the United States.  Although CLS believes that
the  design  changes  it has made to the  units  create  a  superior  unit  and,
therefore,  competitive in the market,  CLS  recognizes  that there is a limited
market for these units and there are existing  manufacturers  in the market that
have more  experience  in the  marketing of these  units.  CLS  management  has,
however,  been directly  involved in the concrete leveling business for the past
14 years  and,  therefore,  has direct  knowledge  as to the  operations  of the
concrete  leveling service unit, as well as the variety of applications to which
it can be used.

     Effective  July 31, 2009,  the Company  entered into a Marketing  Agreement
with Stark Concrete Leveling,  Inc. to become the exclusive  distributor for the
CLS service unit. Stark Concrete Leveling,  Inc. ("Stark") is owned and operated
by Mr.  Edward A. Barth.  Mr. Barth is President of CLS.  Under the terms of the
Marketing  Agreement,  Stark will receive a commission equal to 30% of the sales
price of any unit sold. Stark has waived its commissions on sales since July 31,
2013.  Stark is  responsible  for all costs of  marketing,  and the  training of
buyer's  agent in the use of the units.  Stark intends to continue to market the
service  unit  through  placing ads in  construction  equipment  trade  journals
throughout the United States.

     The majority of the components of the concrete  leveling  service units are
readily  available from several  manufacturers,  as stock items. The Company has
negotiated with the  manufacturers  of key components to be classified as an OEM
manufacturer,  thus receiving a reduced cost for its  components.  Certain items
require custom  fabrication.  The Company has identified a metal  fabricator who
can  specially  fabricate  the  components  to  the  Company's   specifications.
Competitive  fabricators  are available  within the Company's  geographic  area,
should it become necessary to seek another fabricator.

     None of the components  utilized in fabricating the concrete leveling units
are  subject to  patents,  trademarks,  licenses,  franchises  or other  royalty
agreements.  In addition, there is no need for any governmental approval for the
manufacture  or sale of the  concrete  leveling  service  units.  The Company is
unaware of any cost or  effects  resulting  from  required  compliance  with any
federal, state or local environmental laws.

     CLS has three full time  employees,  Mrs.  Suzanne  I. Barth (the  majority
shareholder,  a director  and the  Company's  CEO),  Mr.  Edward A.  Barth,  the
Company's President and Mr. Eugene H. Swearengin,  the Company's  Secretary.  On
July 31, 2013 the Officers forgave all compensation  accrued from August 1, 2012
through  July 31, 2013 and have agreed to work  without  compensation  beginning
August 1, 2013,  until such time as the Company's sales increase to a point that
cash is available to pay salaries.  All other  services  required by the Company
are  performed by  independent  contractors  under the direction of Mr. and Mrs.
Barth.

                                       3
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     The Company is currently  occupying the  commercial  space from which it is
conducting  its  operations  from Mr. Edward A. Barth.  The Company is occupying
this space on a month-to-month basis. It is occupying approximately 2,500 square
feet of space.  On July 31, 2013 Mr. Barth  forgave all rent accrued from August
1, 2012  through  July 31,  2013 and have  agreed  to lease the space  rent free
beginning August 1, 2013.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S  COMMON EQUITY,  RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND
        ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

     MARKET  INFORMATION ON COMMON STOCK. The Company's stock commenced  trading
on the Over the Counter  Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the trading symbol CLEV on
June 25, 2010. There have been no dividends issued by the Company. The volume of
shares  sold  since  trading  began  has  been  very  small.  To the best of the
Company's knowledge,  all trades have involved actual sales and not inter-broker
transactions.   As  of  the  end  of  the  Company's   fiscal  year,  there  are
approximately 8 holders of CLS's common shares. CLEV shares are currently quoted
on the OTC Market. The following  demonstrates the price of the Company's common

     SECURITIES  AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS. At
present,  the  Company  has not set  aside any  securities  for the  purpose  of
providing  compensation  to any of the  Company's  employees.  Although  no plan
exists,  the Board of  Directors  have  issued  common  shares to the  Company's
officers in  satisfaction of salary and rental  obligations of the Company.  All
such  shares  were  issued  at the  share's  fair  market  value  on the date of
authorization. Details of the transactions appear below.

     During the Company's fiscal year, it issued no additional securities.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATION

     The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding
and evaluation of the results of operations,  financial  positions,  cash flows,
indebtedness  and other key  financial  information  of CLS for the fiscal years
2015 and 2016. For a more complete  understanding of this discussion please read
the Notes to Financial Statements included in this report.

                                       4
 
     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  The Company foresees a need for liquidity
over the next twelve  months.  The  Company is of the  opinion  that funds being
received from installment sales of its service units will provide a low level of
cash flow. The Company,  however, lacks funds to establish inventory in the form
of  completed  service  units,  due to the lack of  liquidity.  At present,  the
Company borrows funds from its shareholders to meet liquidity  demands and plans
to continue this practice over the next year.

     The  Company's  intention  is to  maintain  an  inventory  of at least  one
partially completed service unit, the Company will fabricate a completed service
unit upon receipt of a signed Purchase  Order.  It is the Company's  practice to
require a fifty  percent (50%) down payment on all purchase  orders,  therefore,
should  additional  units  be  ordered,  the  Company  will  receive  sufficient
liquidity  from the down payment to fabricate the service unit for the customer.
At present,  Management does not anticipate the need for any significant capital
expenditures  during the next 12 months.  All  fabrication for the service units
are performed by outside  contractors.  Final  assembly will be completed at the
Company's facility by Company employees.  However,  these tasks will not require
additional capital expenditures.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  CLS became an operating  company during fiscal year
ended July 31,  2010.  During the last  fiscal  year,  CLS sold no new units and
otherwise had negligible  sales for the year.  The Company  continues to receive
payments  on the  self-financed  portion of the  service  units sold  during the
fiscal year ending July 31,  2010 and the last  fiscal  year.  However,  CLS has
established   allowances  for  the  potential   uncollectability   of  it  notes
receivable.  CLS continues to incur substantial operating losses, due to lack of
new product sales.  Management is encouraged by the positive  feedback  received
from its  customers  who have  operated the units,  however there are no current
negotiations  for new units.  The  Company can now produce the unit at a reduced
cost, due to the fact that it has been recognized as an OEM  manufacturer by the
manufacturer of the purchased components,  thus enabling the Company to purchase
these components at a reduced rate. CLS has now sold a total of four new service
units.  The  largest  factor  the  Company  experiences  in failing to sell more
service  units is the inability of  purchasers  to obtain  capital  necessary to
purchase the units.

     Over the past fiscal year,  marketing of the Company's product has suffered
as the result of a lack of capital.

     During the  fiscal  year  ending  July 31,  2009,  management  changed  its
position with regard to the marketing and sales of the concrete leveling service
units.  Instead  of  bearing  the cost of  marketing  the  units and the cost of
training the  purchasers  with regard to the operation of the units,  management
has  contracted  with Stark  Concrete  Leveling,  Inc.  ("Stark")  to become its
exclusive  distributor.  Stark is owned by Mr.  Edward A. Barth,  the  Company's
President.  It is through  Mr.  Barth's  effort that the  companies'  sales were
secured. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, Stark is responsible for
the cost of all marketing of the concrete  leveling  service units. In addition,
it is responsible for the onsite training for the purchasers in the operation of
the service units.

     The past sales of the Company's concrete leveling service unit have created
positive  feedback  from the  purchasers.  For the short time that the servicing
units have been in operation, the purchasers have recognized the market for such
services in their area and immediately commence to receive revenues.  Management
is currently  investigating  alternative  methods of marketing its product.  Now
that the concrete  service units have been in the field for several  years,  the
Company has verified the quality of its product.  As the economy  improves,  the
Company is looking forward to the easing of credit for entrepreneurs who wish to
enter into the concrete leveling business.

     OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. There are no off balance sheet arrangements
involving the Company at this time.

financial reporting.  Our audit included  consideration of internal control over
financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are
appropriate  in the  circumstances,  but not for the  purpose of  expressing  an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly,  we express  no such  opinion.  An audit also  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc.
as of July 31,  2016 and 2015,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for each of the years in the  two-year  period  ended  July 31,  2016,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared  assuming  Concrete
Leveling Systems,  Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1
to the  financial  statements,  the nature of the  industry in which the Company
operates raises  substantial  doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. Management's plans regarding this matter are described in Note 1.
The financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the outcome of

          and

5.   The  small  business  issuer's  other  certifying  officer(s)  and  I  have
     disclosed,  based on our most recent  evaluation  of internal  control over

     performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the small  business  issuer's
          ability   to  record,   process,   summarize   and  report   financial
          information; and
     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
