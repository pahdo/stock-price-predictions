NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

Organization

Quadrant 4 System Corporation (sometimes referred to herein as  Quadrant 4,   Company,   we  or  us ) was incorporated by the Florida Department of State on May 9, 1990 as Sun Express Group, Inc. and changed its name on March 31, 2011. The Company changed its domicile to Illinois on April 25, 2013. The Company generates revenue from clients located mostly in North America operating out of multiple office locations in the United States. In addition, the Company s revenues are derived from a few select industries pertaining to information technology, consulting, professional services and vertical cloud platforms that include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change.

Operations

The Company is engaged in the information technology sector as a provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) systems to the health insurance (through our QBIX/QHIX/QWEX    offering), media (through our QBLITZ    offering) and education (through our QEDX    offering) verticals (collectively, the  Platforms ). Along with the Platforms, we also provide core services that leverage on our proprietary Social Media, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) technology  stack  (a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete Platform). These services include Consulting, Application Life Cycle Management, Enterprise Applications   Data Management, Mobility Applications and Business Analytics (collectively,  Consulting ). We blend our Consulting services with our Platforms to offer client-specific and industry-specific solutions to the healthcare, media, education, retail and manufacturing industry segments (collectively,  Solutions ). Consulting and Solutions are referred to together as  Services .

The Company generates revenues principally from two broad segments, namely Services and Platforms. The Services segment includes Consulting, which we bill on a time and materials basis; Solutions, which we bill on time and materials basis; and managed services, which we bill under fixed monthly fees for pre-determined services.  The Platform segment bills on transaction basis such as per member per month enrolled for the QBIX/QHIX/QWEX Platform; per bandwidth consumed for the QBLITZ Platform; and per student per month for the QEDX Platform. The QBIX revenue stream started in 2015 and the QHIX revenue stream started in 2016. The Company expects to increase its Platform-based revenues during the fourth quarter of 2016.

NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements presentation. In the opinion of the management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for interim financial statements have been included. This form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as amended for the year ended December 31, 2015 (as amended, the  2015 Form 10-K ). Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

Consolidated Financial Statements

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include all the accounts of the Company. As of January 1, 2016, DialedIn Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has been merged with and into the Company. As of July 1, 2016, the accounts of Stratitude Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company have been consolidated with those of the Company. In addition, the results of operations of the operation of the assets of Agama Solutions Inc., have also been consolidated with the Company. All intercompany transactions for 2016 have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Estimates

The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates include the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, depreciation and amortization, intangible assets, including software development cost, the fair values estimated for customer lists and technology stacks when we acquire businesses, fair value and useful lives, accruals, contingencies, impairment and valuation of stock warrants and options. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts. Accordingly, actual results could defer from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company considers the carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable to approximate their fair values because of their relatively short maturities.

The Company reviews the terms of the convertible debt and equity instruments that it issues to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments.   In connection with the sale of convertible debt and equity instruments, the Company may issue freestanding warrants that may, depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than as equity.

Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the convertible debt or equity instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds allocated to the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments.  The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face amount. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense, using the effective interest method.

Accounts and Unbilled Receivables

Accounts and unbilled receivables consist of amounts due from customers which are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company records a provision for doubtful receivables, if necessary, to allow for any amounts which may be unrecoverable, which is based upon an analysis of the Company s prior collection experience, customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customers, current economic trends, and changes in customer repayment terms.

Unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the Company s revenue recognition policy, but due to contractual restraints over the timing of invoicing, the Company does not have the right to invoice the customer by the balance sheet date.

Vendors and Contractors

The Company outsources portions of its work to third party service providers (See Note 16). These providers include captive suppliers that undertake software development, research   development and custom platform development. Some vendors may provide specific consultants or resources (often called Corp to Corp) or independent contractors (often designated as 1099) to satisfy agreed deliverables to the Company s clients.

Equipment

Equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated for financial statement purposes using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five (5) to fifteen (15) years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as they are incurred. Improvements and betterments, which extend the lives of the assets, are capitalized. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the appropriate amounts and any profit or loss on the sale or disposition of assets is credited or charged to income.

Table of Contents 

Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of manufactured and preassembled units ready for distribution. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. In evaluating whether inventory is stated lower of cost or market, management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, the distribution channel, the estimated time to sell such inventory, and the current market conditions. Adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value are charged to cost of goods sold.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets, consisting of customer lists and technology stacks, are recorded at fair value and amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 

The carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by management of the Company at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event which may indicate that the carrying amount may be greater than its fair value. Management of the Company performs its impairment testing on a quarterly basis. If impaired, the Company will write-down such impairment. In addition, the useful life of the intangible assets will be evaluated by management at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event which may indicate that the useful life may have changed.

Customer lists are valued based on management s forecast of expected future net cash flows, with revenues based on projected revenues from customers acquired and are being amortized over years ranging from 2 to 5 years.

Technology stacks are valued based on management s forecast of expected future net cash flows, with revenues based on projected sales of these technologies and are amortized over years ranging from 2 to 7 years.

Software Development Costs

Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed software programs are expensed as incurred to research, development (R D) engineering and other administrative support expenses; costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established and after all research and development activities for any other components of the product or process have been completed are capitalized as software development costs. Capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to five years and are recorded in amortization expense which started during 2015 and 2016 when certain of the Platforms first became available for sale. The Company performs reviews at each balance sheet date to ensure that unamortized software development costs remain recoverable from future revenue. Cost to support or service licensed Platforms are charged to cost of revenue as incurred.

The Company s product development and R D are carried out by both our employees in the U.S. as well as outsourced contractors in India. The U.S. employees mainly focus on the domain, market relevance, feasibility and possible pilots/prototypes. The Indian contractors mainly focus on execution in terms of software development and testing.

Pre-paid Expenses

The Company incurs certain costs that are deemed as prepaid expenses. The fees that are paid to the Department of Homeland Security for processing H-1B visa fees for its international employees are amortized over 36 months, typically the life of the visa. One-third of these pre-paid expenses are included in other current assets and two-thirds in other assets. The Company also incurs certain expenses towards the licensing of its platforms and may include special software development costs, testing and commissions.

Deferred Financing Costs

In accordance with FASB ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), the Company has reclassified debt Issuance costs, previously presented as another long-term asset, to a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.

Financing costs incurred in connection with the Company s notes payable and revolving credit facilities are capitalized and amortized into expense using the straight-line method over the life of the respective facility (See Note 10).

Table of Contents 

Deferred Licensing and Royalty Fees

The Company licenses software, platforms and/or content on an as-needed basis and enters into market driven licensing and royalty fee arrangements. If no consumption or usage of such licenses occurs during the reporting period, the Company has no obligation for any minimum fees or royalties and no accruals are posted. Deferred licensing fees are amortized over a period of five years.

Deferred Licensing Revenue

The Company may enter into agreements to license its Platforms and may receive upfront fees as an advance. These fees will be recognized as revenues when the client accepts the delivery of such licenses.

Operating Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements for its offices, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases or periods in which rent payments are abated. Operating leases which provide for lease payments that vary materially from the straight-line basis are adjusted for financial accounting purposes to reflect rental income or expense on the straight-line basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). No such material difference existed as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Financial Instruments

The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.

The Company reviews the terms of the convertible debt and equity instruments that it issues to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion option, that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments.  In connection with the sale of convertible debt and equity instruments, the Company may issue freestanding warrants that may, depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than as equity.

Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the convertible debt or equity instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds allocated to the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments.  The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face amount.

The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense, using the effective interest method.

Goodwill

In connection with the Company s acquisitions, valuations are usually completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of the Company s due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operation, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired.

Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed and determinable, performance of service has occurred and collection is reasonably assured.  Revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided, which range from approximately 2 months to over 1 year. The Company specifically recognizes three kinds of revenues:

1.   
 
 Time and materials   consulting and project engagements fall in this category and revenues are recognized when the client approves the time sheet of consultants who have completed work on their assignment.

2.   
 
 Managed services   engagements where the Company bills a fixed contracted amount per billing period for the defined services provided such as software maintenance, break-fix and hosting services. The client provides no acknowledgement of delivery since the agreed upon service level agreements determine any service deficiencies. Any service deficiencies are addressed within the normal course of the engagement. Since the revenue is not subject to forfeiture, refund or other concession and all delivery obligations are fulfilled and the fee is fixed and determinable, the Company follows the revenue recognition guidance under FASB ASC 985-605.

3.   
 
 Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)   subscription revenues for using the Company s SaaS platforms fall into this category. The Company recognizes the revenues for each period using the starting and ending average of subscriber fees during the billing period.  The objective of the period average is to accommodate frequent changes, such as new hires, terminations, and/or births/deaths on our QHIX health insurance platform. Our platforms automatically determine the average users and no further acknowledgement is required from the clients to recognize these revenues.

The Company did not have any multiple-element revenue streams for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting under the liability method, using expected tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when realization is not considered more likely than not.

The Company s policy is to classify income tax assessments, if any, for interest expense and for penalties in general and administrative expenses. The Company s income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and corresponding states, generally for three years after they are filed.

Income (Loss) per Common Share

Basic income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as options and warrants outstanding during each period.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 5,370,300 potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding since they were anti-dilutive and for three months ended September 30, 2016, there were 5,370,300 potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding since they were anti-dilutive for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 there were 4,139,181 potentially dilutive securities that were included in the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Derivatives

We account for derivatives pursuant to ASC 815,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . All derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. We record our interest rate and foreign currency swaps at fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis and for warrants and other option type instruments based on option pricing models. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in income or expense.

Share-based compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors and others based on the estimated fair values on the date of the grant. Common stock equivalents are valued using the Black-Scholes model using the market price of our common stock on the date of valuation, an expected dividend yield of zero, the remaining period or maturity date of the common stock equivalent and the expected volatility of our common stock.

10 

Table of Contents 

The Company determines the fair value of the share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instrument is reached or the date the performance is complete.

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards with service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is included in operations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash at various financial institutions, which at times, may be in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses to date as a result of this policy and, in assessing its risk, the Company s policy is to maintain cash only with reputable financial institutions.

The Company currently banks at two national institutions, one being the primary and the other being phased out.

The Company s largest customer represented 7.4% and 7.0% of consolidated revenues as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company had one customer that represented 9.7% of its total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, while a customer that represented 24.03%, and a second customer that represented 14.54%, of its total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2015. The Company s largest vendor represented 25.5% of the vendor payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, while two largest vendors represented 26.6% and 7.9% of total vendor payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial positions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods permitted.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which is intended to improve financial reporting for lease transactions by increasing transparency and comparability among organizations. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize the following at the commencement date for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The guidance in ASU No 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have upon adoption.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires an entity to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-09 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606: Identifying performance obligations and licensing implantation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The entity first identifies the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity evaluates whether promised goods and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfy at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). ASU 2016-10 is effective per fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-10 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of the conversion feature of the Notes and the accompanying warrants is bifurcated from the host instrument and recognized at fair value as a derivative liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes model and was initially calculated as $6,857. After the allocation of proceeds between the warrants and the Notes was made, the calculation of the fair value of the conversion price was noted to exceed the fair value of the trading value of the stock and no derivative liability will be recorded at the inception of the Notes. The discount due to the fair value of the warrants will be recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the Notes.

In April 2016, the Company amended the terms of the Notes. As amended, each Note is comprised of a convertible debenture which is payable or convertible to shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.375 per share. Each holder of a Note will receive a detachable warrant to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $0.55 per share.

NOTE 12   FAIR VALUE

Fair Value

The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term and long-term debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates its fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. In addition, the Company believes that its short- and long-term debt terms are commensurate with market terms for similar instruments and approximate fair value.

The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy as defined by ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 )  .  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs, as follows:

Level 1:

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2:

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration; and

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any assets and or liabilities subject to the fair value hierarchy.

Among other requirements, the Company may not permit (i) the ratio of its total funded debt (as defined in the Subordinated Credit Agreement) on the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Company to its consolidated net income before, among other things, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other losses, expenses and charges ( EBITDA ), for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to exceed 3.45 to 1.00, or (ii) the ratio of its EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to its principal payments on indebtedness due within the next four fiscal quarters (including earnout obligations of the Company that could become due within the next four fiscal quarters), interest expense, and income taxes paid for the past four quarters (or annualized in certain circumstances), for the same period to be less than 1.00 to 1.00.

Collateral and Remedies  : The credit made available to the Company pursuant to the Subordinated Credit Agreement is secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.  In addition, the obligations of the Company under the Subordinated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Stratitude.  The Subordinated Credit Agreement contains various events of default typical for subordinated secured credit transactions of this type, including, but not limited to failure to pay any interest, principal, fees or other amounts when due, default under any covenant or agreement in the Subordinated Credit Agreement or the documents delivered in connection therewith, the inaccuracy of statements made by the Company or false representations or warranties of the Company, cross-defaults with other debt obligations of the Company, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, prohibited changes of control and unsatisfied judgments.  The events of default are generally qualified to include customary materiality thresholds and exceptions, and to otherwise include concepts of reasonableness when discretion is granted to the BIP Lender or the Agent, as applicable.  In the event that the Company defaults with respect to the any of its obligations under the Subordinated Credit Agreement or an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Subordinated Credit Agreement permits the Agent to accelerate, and demand payment in full of, all amounts outstanding thereunder. In such event, the Agent has the ability to enforce its remedies against the collateral pledged to the Agent by the Company as noted above.  All of the rights and remedies of the Agent and the BIP Lender are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an intercreditor and subordination agreement (the  Intercreditor Agreement ) by and among BMO Harris Bank N.A. (the Company s senior secured lender), the second lien lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the Agent.

The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements.

Overview

The Company is engaged in the information technology sector as a provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) systems to the health insurance (through our QBIX/QHIX/QWEX  offering), media (through our QBLITZ  offering) and education (through our QEDX  offering) verticals (collectively, the  Platforms ). Along with the Platforms, we also provide core services that leverage on our proprietary Social Media, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) technology  stack  (a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete Platform). These services include Consulting, Application Life Cycle Management, Enterprise Applications   Data Management, Mobility Applications and Business Analytics (collectively,  Consulting ). We blend our Consulting services with our Platforms to offer client-specific and industry-specific solutions to the healthcare, media, education, retail and manufacturing industry segments (collectively,  Solutions ). Consulting and Solutions are referred to together as  Services .

The Company generates revenues principally from two broad segments, namely Services and Platforms. The Services segment includes Consulting, which we bill on a time and materials basis; Solutions, which we bill on time and materials basis; and managed services, which we bill under fixed monthly fees for pre-determined services.  The Platform segment bills on transaction basis such as per member per month enrolled for the QBIX/QHIX/QWEX Platform; per bandwidth consumed for the QBLITZ Platform; and per student per month for the QEDX Platform. The QBIX revenue stream started in 2015 and the QHIX revenue stream started in 2016. The Company expects to increase its Platform-based revenues during the second half of 2016.

Corporate History

Quadrant 4 System Corporation (sometimes referred to herein as  Quadrant 4  or the  Company ) was originally incorporated by the Florida Department of State on May 9, 1990 as Sun Express Group, Inc.

On April 25, 2013, the Company merged with and into Q4 Systems Corporation, an Illinois corporation, in order to redomesticate to Illinois. In the merger, each share of the Florida predecessor corporation was cancelled in exchange for one share of the Illinois corporation. The Company subsequently adopted the name Quadrant 4 System Corporation.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The nature of our business model involves engaging employees and consultants to provide services to our customers with billing accrued and due in normal billing cycles. We also enter into subscription contracts for our software platforms under which clients pay a fixed amount every month. We incur debt to meet payroll obligations, the largest component of our expenses, and service debt with the payments received from our customers. We assist many of our employees and consultants in the immigration process which is an expense component. The Company utilizes few major capital items in the delivery of its services and requires no significant plant expenses beyond ordinary commercial office space for both use by its employees, on a limited basis, and back-office support for those employees.

Results of Operations

Our revenues and expenses reflect the assets acquired and new businesses acquired during the past two years.

GROSS MARGIN

The increase in gross margin of $570,062 or 11% for the three months ending September 30, 2016 compared to the previous three-month period ending September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from increased revenues. The gross margin percentages were 37% and 42% for the periods ended September 2016 and 2015 respectively. The reduction of 5% in gross margin was due to increase in services revenue for the period.

The marginal increase in gross margin of $32,179 over the previous nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 was due to software licensing during the period ended June 30, 2016. The gross margin percentage decreased to approximately 38% from 41% during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

General and administrative expenses for the three months ending September 30, 2016 totaled $3,539,481 compared to general and administrative expenses of $2,966,097 during the same period in 2015. The increase in general   administrative expenses of $573,384 or 19% over the previous period was due to compliance related legal expenses and costs related to our acquisition of Stratitude and the assets and customer contracts of Agama during this period.

The increase in general   administrative expenses of $678,441 or 8% over the previous nine month period was due in part to an increase in fees related to the July 2016 financing in addition to increases in legal and professional fees.

RESEARCH   DEVELOPMENT

Research and development (R D) expenses for the three months ending September 30, 2016 totaled $68,062 compared to R D expenses of $417,997 during the same period in 2015. The decrease in R D expenses of $349,935 or 84% over the previous second quarter was due to conversion of certain expenses to capitalized software development.

R D expenses for the Nine months ending September 30, 2016 totaled $422,888 compared to R D expenses of $1,458,020 during the same period in 2015. The decrease in R D expenses of $1,035,132 or 71% over the previous nine-month period, was due to conversion of certain expenses to capitalized software development as those projects have now progressed past the research phase and into the development phase.

DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Amortization expense for the three months ending September 30, 2016 totaled $1,607,116 compared to $1,349,401 during the same period in 2015. The increase in amortization expense of $257,715 was due to amortization of certain customer lists added in the last quarter of 2015 and current quarter of 2016.

The increase in interest expenses of $213,819 or 41% over the previous period was due to our refinancing of our debt through our new loans through BMO Harris.  We expect in future periods that our interest expense will decrease substantially as the rates we obtained through our loans from BMO Harris are significantly less than what we were previously being charged by our various loan and convertible note holders.

The Company reported net loss of $73,356 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $51,565 for the same period in 2015.

The decrease in profit of $498,497 or 189% over the previous nine-month period, was the result of decreased gross margins and increased general and administrative expenses.

EBITDA

In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we report earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other one time/non-recurring expenses or gains as ( EBITDA ), a non-GAAP financial measure, in this report. This non-GAAP financial measure is intended to aid investors in better understanding the Company s current financial performance and its prospects for the future as seen through the eyes of management. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates comparisons with our historical results and with the results of peer companies who present similar measures (although other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we define them, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures). However, non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to the most applicable financial measure under GAAP, net income, refer to the tables below.

EBITDA for the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was calculated as follows:

EBITDA for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was calculated as follows:

EBITDA for the three months ending September 30, 2016 increased by $346,613 or 18% over the previous three months and EBITDA for the nine month period ending September 30,2015 increased by $388,870 or 7% over the previous nine-month period.

At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $19,271,322 as compared to $19,037,276 at December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $140,434 as compared to working capital deficit of $6,117,922 at December 31, 2015.

Net cash used by operations for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was $3,470,534 as compared to $1,645,470 primarily relating to the increases in accounts receivable and software development costs, offset in part of by the increase in accounts payable.

Net cash provided by investing activity for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was $728,140 due to addition of cash from the acquisition.

Net cash provided in financing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was $4,007,721 as compared to $508,161, an increase of $3,499,560 primarily due to increase in borrowings under the senior facility in the 2016 period.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

There are no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Impact of Inflation

We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016.  We cannot provide assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Item 3.          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Not required.  

Item 4.          Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, which is September 30, 2016. Based on such evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures specific to certain transactions were not effective.  Rapid growth and inadequate staffing were the main reasons for such ineffective controls. Management has identified an action plan to remedy any ineffective controls that include additional staffing, realignment of existing staff, a search to hire a Chief Financial Officer and hiring of an outside consultant to assist with internal controls. The Company has created a well-defined financial and accounting control matrix and procedures document which is in the process of being implemented.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, and effected by the Company s management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

Management is committed to continuous improvement in all areas of controls and procedures. The Company has instituted additional procedures to review its interim financial statements and significant transactions with the audit committee on a regular basis.

Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not operating effectively as of September 30, 2016.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

In order to address certain separation of duties and governance issues the Company has added additional human resources as well as a realignment of existing staff in its accounting and finance departments and instituted additional procedures to review its interim financial statements and significant transactions with the audit committee on a regular basis in the spirit of continuing to improve internally.

These additions have improved accountability and created segregation of responsibilities across additional people which has resulted in improvement in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) subsequent to the year ending December 31, 2015.
