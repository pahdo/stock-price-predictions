CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. ("Piedmont"), or its executive officers on Piedmont s behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents Piedmont files with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in connection with other written or oral statements made to the press, potential investors, or others. Statements regarding future events and developments and Piedmont s future performance, as well as management s expectations, beliefs, plans, estimates, or projections relating to the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of these laws. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words  may,   will,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,  or other similar words. Examples of such statements in this report include descriptions of our real estate, financings, and operating objectives; discussions regarding future dividends and share repurchases; and discussions regarding the potential impact of economic conditions on our real estate and lease portfolio. 
    
  These statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of Piedmont s management, which in turn are based on information available at the time the statements are made. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding the demands for office space in the markets in which Piedmont operates, competitive conditions, and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. The forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond Piedmont s ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Economic, regulatory, and/or socio-economic changes (including accounting standards) that impact the real estate market generally, or that could affect patterns of use of commercial office space, may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties; 
                
    The impact of competition on our efforts to renew existing leases or re-let space on terms similar to existing leases; 
                
    Changes in the economies and other conditions affecting the office sector in general and the specific markets in which we operate, particularly in Washington, D.C., the New York metropolitan area, and Chicago where we have high concentrations of office properties; 
                
    Lease terminations or lease defaults, particularly by one of our large lead tenants; 
                
    Adverse market and economic conditions may negatively affect us and could cause us to recognize impairment charges on both our long-lived assets or goodwill or otherwise impact our performance; 
                
    The success of our real estate strategies and investment objectives, including our ability to identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and divestitures; 
                
    The illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties; 
                
    Acquisitions of properties may have unknown risks and other liabilities at the time of acquisition; 
                
    Development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks may negatively impact our operating results; 
                
    Our real estate development strategies may not be successful; 
                
    Future acts of terrorism in any of the major metropolitan areas in which we own properties, or future cybersecurity attacks against us or any of our tenants, could significantly impact the demand for, and value of, our properties; 
                
    Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations; 
                
    Additional risks and costs associated with directly managing properties occupied by government tenants; 
                
    Future offerings of debt or equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock; 
                
    Changes in market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock; 
                
    Uncertainties associated with environmental and other regulatory matters; 
                
    Potential changes in political environment and reduction in federal and/or state funding of our governmental tenants; 
                
    We may be subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition; 
                
    Changes in tax laws impacting REITs and real estate in general, as well as Piedmont s ability to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and 
                
    Other factors, including the risk factors discussed under Item 1A. of Piedmont s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
     Management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and management undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.

1.  Organization 
  Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. ( Piedmont ) (NYSE: PDM) is a Maryland corporation that operates in a manner so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes and engages in the acquisition, development, management, and ownership of commercial real estate properties throughout the United States, including properties that are under construction, are newly constructed, or have operating histories. Piedmont was incorporated in 1997 and commenced operations in 1998. Piedmont conducts business primarily through Piedmont Operating Partnership, L.P. ( Piedmont OP ), a Delaware limited partnership, as well as performing the management of its buildings through   two   wholly-owned subsidiaries, Piedmont Government Services, LLC and Piedmont Office Management, LLC. Piedmont owns   99.9%   of, and is the sole general partner of, Piedmont OP and as such, possesses full legal control and authority over the operations of Piedmont OP. The remaining   0.1%   ownership interest of Piedmont OP is held indirectly by Piedmont through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Piedmont Office Holdings, Inc. ("POH"), the sole limited partner of Piedmont OP. Piedmont OP owns properties directly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. References to Piedmont herein shall include Piedmont and all of its subsidiaries, including Piedmont OP and its subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Piedmont owned   65   office properties,   one   redevelopment asset,   two   development assets, and   one   building through an unconsolidated joint venture. Piedmont's   65   office properties comprise   18.4 million   square feet of primarily Class A commercial office space, and were   93.4%   leased as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   87%   of Piedmont's Annualized Lease Revenue was generated from select office sub-markets in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, and Washington, D.C. 
    
  Piedmont internally evaluates all of its real estate assets as   one   operating segment, and accordingly, does not report segment information. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements of Piedmont have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of a full year s results. 
    
  Piedmont s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Piedmont, Piedmont s wholly-owned subsidiaries, any variable interest entity ("VIE") of which Piedmont or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is considered to have the power to direct the activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits, or any entity in which Piedmont or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns a controlling interest. In determining whether Piedmont or Piedmont OP has a controlling interest, the following factors, among others, are considered: equity ownership, voting rights, protective rights of investors, and participatory rights of investors. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in Piedmont s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
    
  Further, Piedmont has formed special purpose entities to acquire and hold real estate. Each special purpose entity is a separate legal entity. Consequently, the assets of these special purpose entities are not available to all creditors of Piedmont. The assets owned by these special purpose entities are being reported on a consolidated basis with Piedmont s assets for financial reporting purposes only.

     Table of Contents  

Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Piedmont has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has operated as such, beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 1998. To qualify as a REIT, Piedmont must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least   90%   of its annual REIT taxable income. As a REIT, Piedmont is generally not subject to federal income taxes, subject to fulfilling, among other things, this distribution requirement. Piedmont is subject to certain taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, as well as operations conducted by its taxable REIT subsidiary, POH, which have been provided for in the financial statements. 
    
  Tenant Receivables, net and Straight-line Rent Receivables 
    
  Tenant receivables are comprised of rental and reimbursement billings due from tenants, and straight-line rent receivables representing the cumulative amount of future adjustments necessary to present rental income on a straight-line basis. Tenant receivables are recorded at the original amount earned, less an allowance for any doubtful accounts, which approximates estimated fair value. Management assesses the collectibility of tenant receivables on an ongoing basis and provides for allowances as such balances, or portions thereof, become uncollectible. Effective July 1, 2016, Piedmont began classifying provisions for bad debts as nonrecoverable property operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income to include such expenses as a component of operating the underlying properties. Previously, such costs were presented as general and administrative expenses. In order to conform with the presentation used during the three months ended September 30, 2016, Piedmont reclassified approximately   $100,000   of provisions for/(recoveries of) bad debts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and approximately   $(20,000)   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Further, Piedmont recognized approximately   $190,000   of provisions for bad debts during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a component of nonrecoverable property operating costs. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted during the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
    
  As of January 1, 2016, Piedmont early adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). The provisions in ASU 2016-09 simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The implementation of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the reclassification of approximately   $1.7 million   related to income tax consequences for share-based compensation from cash outflows from operating activities to cash outflows from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, as of January 1, 2016, Piedmont also adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05,   Intangibles- Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   on a prospective basis. 
    
  Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),     Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ("ASU 2016-05"). The amendments in ASU 2016-05 clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments in ASU 2016-05 are effective in the first quarter of 2017, and Piedmont does not anticipate any material impact to its consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("ASU 2014-09") and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ("ASU 2016-08"). The amendments in ASU 2014-09, which are further clarified in ASU 2016-08, as well as ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, change the criteria for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services using a five-step determination process. Steps 1 through 5 involve (i) identifying contracts with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue as an entity satisfies a performance obligation. Additionally, lease contracts are specifically excluded from ASU 2014-09. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-08 are effective in the first quarter of 2018, and Piedmont is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01"). The amendments in ASU 2016-01 require equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, to be measured at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments, and eliminates certain disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective in the first quarter of 2018, and Piedmont is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   ("ASU 2016-02"). The amendments in ASU 2016-02 fundamentally change the definition of a lease, as well as the accounting for operating leases by requiring leasees to recognize assets and liabilities which arise from the lease, consisting of a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the leased asset over the term of the lease. Accounting for leases for lessors is substantially unchanged from prior practice, which means continuing to recognize lease revenue on a straight-line basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective in the first quarter of 2019, and Piedmont is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326),     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). The provisions of ASU 2016-13 replace the "incurred loss" approach with an "expected loss" model for impairing trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investment in leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowance for losses. Additionally, the provisions change the classification of credit losses on available-for-sale securities as an allowance rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. Piedmont is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). The provisions of ASU 2016-15 provide clarity of treatment in the statement of cash flows for several transactions, including debt repayments or debt extinguishment costs, proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees, among several other topics. The FASB issued ASU 2016-15 in an effort to eliminate diversity in practice regarding treatment of specific transactions in the statements of cash flows for registrants. ASU 2016-15 is effective for Piedmont in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. Piedmont is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 

3.  Acquisitions 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Piedmont acquired   one   property, as well as a   99%   interest in a joint venture owning   two   properties, using proceeds from the   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit, proceeds from the sales of other properties, and cash on hand, as noted below:

  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Piedmont repaid the outstanding balance of its   $125 Million   Fixed-Rate Loan and its   $42.5 Million   Fixed-Rate Loan, utilizing the first available prepayment opportunity without penalty. Separately, Piedmont incurred net borrowings on its   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit of approximately   $131.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , Piedmont believes it was in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its debt instruments. See    Note 7    for a description of Piedmont s estimated fair value of debt as of   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Piedmont made interest payments on all debt facilities, including interest rate swap cash settlements, of approximately   $18.5 million   and   $20.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $53.2 million     and     $58.8 million     for the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Piedmont capitalized interest of approximately   $1.5 million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $3.4 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

5.  Variable Interest Entities 
  Variable interest holders who have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the entity or the right to receive significant benefits of the entity must consolidate the VIE. Each of the following VIEs has the sole purpose of holding land and office buildings and their resulting operations, and are classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as Piedmont s wholly-owned properties.  
  A summary of Piedmont s interests in, and consolidation treatment of, its VIEs and their related carrying values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows (net carrying amount in millions):

Piedmont TownPark Land, LLC previously had an equity participation rights agreement outstanding; however, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Piedmont exercised its right to terminate the equity participation rights agreement related to Piedmont TownPark Land, LLC, without payment of any consideration. 

6.  Derivative Instruments 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
    
  In addition to operational risks which arise in the normal course of business, Piedmont is exposed to economic risks such as interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk. In certain situations, Piedmont has entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements and other similar agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure arising from current or future variable rate debt transactions. Interest rate swap agreements involve the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Piedmont s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. 

14 

     Table of Contents  

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Piedmont making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without changing the underlying notional amount. As of   September 30, 2016  , Piedmont was party to various interest rate swap agreements which fully hedge the variable cash flows associated with its   $300 Million   Unsecured 2011 Term Loan and its   $300 Million   Unsecured 2013 Term Loan. Piedmont continues to hold forward starting interest rate swap agreements related to the extension period of the   $300 Million   Unsecured 2011 Term Loan, and the maximum length of time over which Piedmont is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is   39   months. 
    
  A detail of Piedmont s interest rate derivatives outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Piedmont presents its interest rate derivatives on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis as interest rate swap assets and interest rate swap liabilities. A detail of Piedmont s interest rate derivatives on a gross and net basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is as follows (in thousands): 

All of Piedmont's interest rate derivative agreements outstanding for the periods presented were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. As such, the effective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income ("OCI") and is reclassified into earnings as interest expense in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. In addition, in conjunction with the issuance of various unsecured notes, Piedmont settled various forward starting swap agreements for gains/losses which were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income and are being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the term of the respective notes on a straight line basis (which approximates the effective interest method). 
    
  The effective portion of Piedmont's interest rate derivatives, including the gain/(loss) on previously settled forward swaps, that was recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, was as follows (in thousands): 

15 

     Table of Contents  

Piedmont estimates that approximately   $5.4 million   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the next twelve months. Piedmont recognized   no   loss related to hedge ineffectiveness and terminations of its cash flow hedges during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Additionally, see    Note 7    for fair value disclosures of Piedmont's derivative instruments. 
    
  Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
    
  Piedmont has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if Piedmont defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Piedmont could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. If Piedmont were to breach any of the contractual provisions of the derivative contracts, it would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of the estimated fair values plus accrued interest, or approximately   $18.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, Piedmont has rights of set-off under certain of its derivative agreements related to potential termination fees and amounts payable under the agreements, if a termination were to occur. 

7.  Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments 
  Piedmont considers its cash and cash equivalents, tenant receivables, notes receivable, restricted cash and escrows, accounts payable and accrued expenses, interest rate swap agreements, and debt to meet the definition of financial instruments. The following table sets forth the carrying and estimated fair value for each of Piedmont s financial instruments, as well as its level within the GAAP fair value hierarchy, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (in thousands): 

(1)   
    For the periods presented, the carrying value of these financial instruments approximates estimated fair value due to their short-term maturity. 
       
  Piedmont's debt was carried at book value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ; however, Piedmont's estimate of its estimated fair value is disclosed in the table above. Piedmont uses widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the debt facilities, including the period to maturity of each instrument, and uses observable market-based inputs for similar debt facilities which have transacted recently in the market. Therefore, the estimated fair values determined are considered to be based on significant other observable inputs (Level 2). Scaling adjustments are made to these inputs to make them applicable to the remaining life of Piedmont's outstanding debt. Piedmont has not changed its valuation technique for estimating the fair value of its debt.  
    
  Piedmont s interest rate swap and forward starting interest rate swap agreements presented above, and further discussed in    Note 6   , are classified as  Interest rate swap  liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were carried at estimated fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The valuation of these derivative instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity of each instrument, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. Therefore, the estimated fair values determined are considered to be based on significant other observable inputs (Level 2). In addition, Piedmont considered both its own and the respective counterparties  risk of nonperformance in determining the estimated fair value of its derivative financial instruments by estimating the current and potential future exposure under the derivative financial instruments that both Piedmont and the counterparties were at risk for as of the valuation date. The  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

credit risk of Piedmont and its counterparties was factored into the calculation of the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps; however, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , this credit valuation adjustment did not comprise a material portion of the estimated fair value. Therefore, Piedmont believes that any unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair values of its derivative financial instruments are not significant to the fair value measurements in their entirety, and does not consider any of its derivative financial instruments to be Level 3 liabilities. 

8.  Impairment Loss on Real Estate Assets 
    
  Piedmont recorded impairment loss on real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as follows (in thousands): 

(1)   
    Piedmont recognized an impairment loss on real estate assets based upon the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the contracted sales price, less estimated selling costs. 
       
            (2)   
    Piedmont, using a probability-weighted model heavily weighted towards the short-term sale of the 9221 Corporate Boulevard building in Rockville, Maryland, determined that the carrying value would not be recovered from the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. As a result, Piedmont recognized a loss on impairment of approximately   $2.3 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the anticipated contract sales price, less estimated selling costs. 
       
            (3)   
    Piedmont elected to sell its remaining   two   assets and exit the Rockville, Maryland sub-market of Washington, D.C, after selling the 9221 Corporate Boulevard building in July 2016 (mentioned above). Upon management's change in its hold period assumption for the assets from a long-term hold to a near-term sale, Piedmont recognized an impairment loss of approximately   $22.6 million  . The impairment loss was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the anticipated contracted sales price, less estimated selling costs. Piedmont reclassified the properties as held for sale, recognized an impairment loss, entered into a binding contract, and subsequently sold the 9200 and 9211 Corporate Boulevard buildings during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
       
            (4)   
    The fair value measurements used in the evaluation of the non-financial assets above are considered to be Level 1 valuations within the fair value hierarchy as defined by GAAP, as there are direct observations and transactions involving the assets by unrelated, third-party purchasers. 

9.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Commitments Under Existing Lease Agreements 
    
  Under its existing lease agreements, Piedmont may be required to fund significant tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and building improvements. In addition, certain agreements contain provisions that require Piedmont to issue corporate or property guarantees to provide funding for capital improvements or other financial obligations. Piedmont classifies its capital improvements into   two   categories: (i) improvements which maintain the building's existing asset value and its revenue generating capacity ( non-incremental capital expenditures ) and (ii) improvements which incrementally enhance the building's asset value by expanding its revenue generating capacity ( incremental capital expenditures ). As of   September 30, 2016  , commitments to fund potential non-incremental capital expenditures over the next   five   years for tenant improvements totaled approximately   $37.7 million   related to Piedmont's existing lease portfolio over the respective lease terms, the majority of which Piedmont estimates may be required to be funded over the next   three   years based on when the underlying leases commence. For most of Piedmont s leases, the timing of the actual funding of these tenant improvements is largely dependent upon tenant requests for reimbursement. In some cases, these obligations may expire with the leases without further recourse to Piedmont. As of   September 30, 2016  , commitments for incremental capital expenditures for tenant improvements associated with executed leases totaled approximately   $31.3 million  . 

17 

     Table of Contents  

Contingencies Related to Tenant Audits/Disputes 
    
  Certain lease agreements include provisions that grant tenants the right to engage independent auditors to audit their annual operating expense reconciliations. Such audits may result in the re-interpretation of language in the lease agreements which could result in the refund of previously recognized tenant reimbursement revenues, resulting in financial loss to Piedmont. Piedmont recorded   no   such reductions in reimbursement revenues related to such tenant audits/disputes during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $0   and   $0.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Additionally, from time to time, tenants may attempt to dispute language in their lease agreements which could result in the refund of previously recognized tenant revenues, resulting in financial loss to Piedmont. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Piedmont filed suit against   one   such tenant. While Piedmont believes it will ultimately prevail in this matter, due to the uncertainties inherent in any litigation, Piedmont has determined that the risk of financial loss is reasonably possible. As of   September 30, 2016  , the range of reasonably possible loss, net of reserves, is estimated to be   $0   to   $1.8 million  .  

10.  Property Dispositions, Assets Held for Sale, and Discontinued Operations 
    
  Properties sold during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. The operational results for these properties prior to their sale dates are presented as continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and the gain/(loss) on sale is presented separately on the face of the income statement. Details of such properties sold are presented below (in thousands):

    The dispositions of Aon Center in Chicago, Illinois on October 29, 2015, and 2 Gatehall Drive in Parsippany, New Jersey on December 21, 2015 has impacted the comparative analysis of operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
               (2)   
    As part of the transaction, Piedmont accepted a secured promissory note from the buyer for   $45.4 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the note receivable was repaid in full and such proceeds are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows as net sales proceeds from the sale of wholly-owned properties. 
               (3)   
    As part of the transaction, Piedmont accepted a secured promissory note from the buyer for   $33.0 million  ; however, the note receivable was repaid in full by   September 30, 2016  . As such, the full proceeds from the sale of the property are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows as net sales proceeds from the sale of wholly-owned properties. 
               (4)   
    As discussed in    Note 8    above, Piedmont recognized an impairment loss of approximately   $22.6 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As the sale was consummated within the same quarter, there was no gain or loss recognized upon the sale. 
       
  Assets Held for Sale 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, no assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale; however, as the 150 West Jefferson building met the held-for-sale criteria as of June 30, 2016, it is presented as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 for comparative purposes. Details of amounts held for sale as of December 31, 2015 are presented below (in thousands):

11.  Stock Based Compensation 
  From time to time, Piedmont has granted equity awards to all of its employees and independent directors. The deferred stock awards are determined by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Piedmont and typically vest on the award anniversary date ratably over a multi-year period. Piedmont also has a multi-year performance share program for certain of its employees whereby equity awards may be earned based on the relative performance of Piedmont's total stockholder return ("TSR") as compared with a predetermined peer group's total stockholder return over the same multi-year period. Shares, if earned, are not awarded until after the end of the multi-year performance period and vest upon award. Shares granted to independent directors generally vest over a   one  -year service period. 
    
  A rollforward of Piedmont's equity based award activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

The following table provides additional information regarding stock award activity during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands except for per share data):

A detail of Piedmont s outstanding stock awards as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

(1)   
    Amounts reflect the total grant to employees and independent directors, net of shares surrendered upon vesting to satisfy required minimum tax withholding obligations through   September 30, 2016  . 
               (2)   
    Estimated based on Piedmont's cumulative TSR for the respective performance period through   September 30, 2016  . Share estimates are subject to change in future periods based on both Piedmont's and its peers' stock performance and dividends paid. 
       
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Piedmont recognized approximately   $2.0 million   and   $2.6 million   of compensation expense related to stock awards, all of which related to the amortization of unvested shares. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Piedmont recognized approximately   $7.7 million   and   $6.8 million   of compensation expense related to stock awards, of which   $6.2 million   and   $5.0 million   related to the amortization of unvested shares, respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a net total of   183,609   shares were issued to employees. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $5.0 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested deferred stock awards remained, which Piedmont will record in its consolidated statements of income over a weighted-average vesting period of approximately   one   year. 

12.  Earnings Per Share 
    
  There are no adjustments to  Net income applicable to Piedmont  for the diluted earnings per share computations. 
    
  Net income per share-basic is calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Net income per share-diluted is calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including unvested deferred stock awards. Diluted weighted average number of common shares reflects the potential dilution under the treasury stock  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

method that would occur if the remaining unvested deferred stock awards vested and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. Unvested deferred stock awards which are determined to be anti-dilutive are not included in the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares. 
    
  The following table reconciles the denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share computations shown on the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands):

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. ( Piedmont ). See also  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  preceding Part I, as well as the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We intend to use cash flows generated from the operation of our properties, proceeds from our $500 Million Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit, and proceeds from selective property dispositions as our primary sources of immediate liquidity. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we continued our ongoing portfolio refinement strategy by disposing of four non-strategic assets. Using net sales proceeds from those dispositions, cash on hand, and borrowings under our $500 Million Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit, we acquired one property in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as a 99% interest in a joint venture owning two assets in Orlando, Florida. As of the filing date, we have $276 million of capacity under our line of credit. From time to time, we may also seek additional secured or unsecured borrowings from third-party lenders or issue securities as additional sources of capital. The availability and attractiveness of terms for these additional sources of capital are highly dependent on market conditions.  
  Our most consistent use of capital has historically been, and we believe will continue to be, to fund capital expenditures for our existing portfolio of properties. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   we incurred the following types of capital expenditures (in thousands): 

(1)   
         Of the total amounts paid, approximately   $5.1 million   and   $4.3 million   relates to soft costs such as capitalized interest, payroll, and other general and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
  "Capital expenditures for development" relate to new office development projects. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our active development project was 500 TownPark, a new 135,000 square foot, 80% pre-leased, four-story office building which is being constructed adjacent to our existing 400 TownPark building in Lake Mary, Florida. Total additional project costs on the 500 TownPark project are anticipated to be between $16-$18 million, inclusive of leasing costs. The project is expected to be completed early in 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our only active development project was Enclave Place, our now-complete, 300,000 square foot, 11-story office tower in Houston, Texas.  
    
  "Capital expenditures for redevelopment/renovations" during both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 related to a now-complete redevelopment project that converted our 3100 Clarendon Boulevard building in Arlington, Virginia from governmental use into Class A private sector office space. 
    
  "Other capital expenditures" include all other capital expenditures during the period and are typically comprised of tenant and building improvements and leasing commissions necessary to lease or maintain our existing portfolio of office properties.  
    
  Piedmont classifies its tenant and building improvements into two categories: (i) improvements which maintain the building's existing asset value and its revenue generating capacity ( non-incremental capital expenditures ) and (ii) improvements which incrementally enhance the building's asset value by expanding its revenue generating capacity ( incremental capital expenditures ). Commitments for funding non-incremental capital expenditures for tenant improvements over the next five years related to Piedmont's existing lease portfolio total approximately   $37.7 million  . The timing of the funding of these commitments is largely dependent upon tenant requests for reimbursement; however, we anticipate that a significant portion of these improvement allowances may be requested over the next three years based on when the underlying leases commence. In some instances, these obligations may expire with the respective lease, without further recourse to us. Additionally, commitments for incremental capital  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

expenditures for tenant improvements associated with executed leases totaled approximately   $31.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition to the amounts described above that we have already committed to as a part of executed leases, we anticipate continuing to incur similar market-based tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions in conjunction with procuring future leases for our existing portfolio of properties, including recently completed development and redevelopment projects. Given that our operating model frequently results in leases for large blocks of space to credit-worthy tenants, our leasing success can result in significant capital outlays. For example, for leases executed during   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we committed to spend approximately   $3.68   and   $1.54   per square foot per year of lease term for tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, respectively, and for those executed during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we committed to spend approximately $4.86 and $1.84 per square foot per year of lease term for tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, respectively. Both the timing and magnitude of expenditures related to future leasing activity are highly dependent on the competitive market conditions at the time of lease negotiations of the particular office market within which a given lease is signed.  
    
  There are several other uses of capital that may arise as part of our typical operations. Subject to the identification and availability of attractive investment opportunities and our ability to consummate such acquisitions on satisfactory terms, acquiring new assets compatible with our investment strategy could also be a significant use of capital. For example, we recently acquired a   99%   interest in the entity that owns CNL Tower I   II, two trophy office buildings located in Orlando, Florida's central business district, for a net purchase price of   $166.7 million  , as well as the One Wayside Road building in Boston, Massachusetts, an asset adjacent to our 5 and 15 Wayside Road assets for a net purchase price of $62.9 million. Further, our Board of Directors has authorized a $200 million stock repurchase program, of which approximately   $70.2 million   of authorized capacity remains, pursuant to which we may use capital resources to purchase our common stock when we believe the stock is trading at a meaningful discount to what we believe the estimated fair value of our net assets to be. Finally, after the pay-off of the $42.5 Million Fixed-Rate Loan during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we have no debt maturing until the fourth quarter of 2017; however, on a longer term basis, we expect to use capital to pay down our line of credit, and to repay other debt when such obligations become due. 
    
  The amount and form of payment (cash or stock issuance) of future dividends to be paid to our stockholders will continue to be largely dependent upon (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities; (ii) our expectations of future cash flows; (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for debt repayments, development projects, and selective acquisitions of new properties; (iv) the timing of significant expenditures for tenant improvements, building redevelopment projects, and general property capital improvements; (v) long-term payout ratios for comparable companies; (vi) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, including potential sales of our properties; and (vii) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT. Given the fluctuating nature of cash flows and expenditures, we may periodically borrow funds on a short-term basis to cover timing differences in cash receipts and cash disbursements. 

Results of Operations  
    
  Overview 
    
  We recognized a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $0.09 per fully diluted share for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared with a net loss of $0.01 per fully diluted share for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The loss in both periods was driven by the recognition of impairment charges related to the subsequent sales of certain assets in each period. The impairment loss recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was partially offset by $0.11 per diluted share in gains on sales of real estate assets. Revenues and property operating costs both decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the sale of thirteen assets since July 1, 2015, including our largest asset, Aon Center, during the fourth quarter of 2015. These decreases were partially offset by revenue and operating costs from the acquisition of seven assets subsequent to July 1, 2015, and revenue associated with new leases commencing, both of which have contributed to overall occupancy gains over the last twelve months.

Revenue 
    
  Rental income   decreased   approximately   $4.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to net disposition activity over the last fifteen months, which included the sale of our largest asset, Aon Center in Chicago, Illinois, representing over 10% of our portfolio's total square feet. This net disposition activity contributed approximately $7.7 million to the quarterly variance; however, new leases commencing during 2015 and 2016 across our portfolio provided additional revenue which offset a portion of this unfavorable variance. 
    
  Tenant reimbursements   decreased   approximately   $6.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by net disposition activity during 2015 and thus far in 2016, contributing approximately $7.7 million to the variance. This decrease in reimbursement income was partially offset by the expiration of operating expense abatements for certain of our tenants, coupled with an increase in occupancy across our portfolio. 
    
  Expense 
    
  Property operating costs   decreased   approximately   $6.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to net disposition activity during 2015 and 2016, which accounted for approximately $6.3 million of the variance. In addition, favorable property tax adjustments and refunds at certain properties in our existing portfolio during the current period contributed to the decrease in property operating costs as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Depreciation expense   increased   approximately   $0.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to depreciation of additional tenant and building improvements placed in to service subsequent to July 1, 2015, partially offset by net disposition activity during 2015 and thus far in 2016. 
    
  Amortization expense   increased   approximately   $4.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year. Of the total variance, approximately $6.2 million of expense was attributable to increased amortization of intangible lease assets recognized as part of acquiring new properties during 2015 and 2016. This increase was partially offset by certain lease intangible assets at our existing properties becoming fully amortized subsequent to July 1, 2015. 
    
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized impairment charges totaling approximately   $22.6 million   related to the decision to sell our 9200 and 9211 Corporate Boulevard buildings in Rockville, Maryland, which ultimately sold in September 2016 (see    Note 8   ). During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized an impairment charge of   $34.8 million   related to our 2 Gatehall Drive building in Parsippany, New Jersey.

     Table of Contents  

General and administrative expenses   decreased   approximately   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher compensation accruals for potential performance-based stock compensation during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Interest expense   decreased   approximately   $3.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a net decrease in our average debt outstanding as we used a portion of the proceeds from our disposition activity in both 2015 and 2016 to pay down secured debt and borrowings under our line of credit. 
    
  We recognized a decrease of approximately   $1.5 million   in other income/(expense) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. The variance is primarily attributable to interest income recognized on a note receivable extended to the purchaser of our Copper Ridge building in Lyndhurst, New Jersey during 2015, which was repaid in full in February 2016, contributing approximately $1.0 million to the variance. The remainder of the variance is due to an increase in costs incurred in the current period associated with the acquisition of new properties. 

Comparison of the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   versus the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  The following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as well as each balance as a percentage of total revenues for the same periods presented (dollars in millions): 

Revenue 
    
  Rental income   decreased   approximately   $13.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to net disposition activity since January 1, 2015, which included the sale of our largest asset, Aon Center, representing over 10% of our portfolio's total square feet, during the fourth quarter of 2015. The net disposition activity contributed approximately $24.0 million to the variance for the nine month period; however, new leases commencing during 2015 and 2016 across our portfolio provided additional revenue of approximately $11.1 million which offsets this unfavorable variance. 
    
  Tenant reimbursements   decreased   approximately   $20.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by net disposition activity during 2015 and thus far in 2016, which  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

contributed approximately $22.1 million to the variance. This decrease in reimbursement income was partially offset by the expiration of operating expense abatements for certain of our tenants, coupled with an increase in occupancy across our portfolio. 
    
  Expense 
    
  Property operating costs   decreased   approximately   $26.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to net disposition activity during 2015 and thus far in 2016, which accounted for approximately $24.1 million of the variance. In addition, recoverable ice and snow removal costs at several of our properties in the Boston and New York area were lower in 2016 due to a milder winter than in 2015. 
    
  Depreciation expense   decreased   approximately   $8.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year. Approximately $13.9 million of the variance was attributable to net disposition activity during 2015 and thus far in 2016, offset by depreciation on additional tenant and building improvements placed in service subsequent to January 1, 2015. 
    
  Amortization expense   increased   approximately   $10.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. Of the total variance, approximately $15.5 million of expense is due to additional amortization of intangible lease assets recognized as part of acquiring new properties during 2015 and 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets as a result of disposing of seventeen properties during 2015 and thus far in 2016, as well as certain lease intangible assets at our existing properties becoming fully amortized subsequent to January 1, 2015. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized impairment charges to adjust the carrying values of our 150 West Jefferson building in Detroit, Michigan and our 9200, 9211, and 9221 Corporate Boulevard buildings to their estimated fair values in conjunction with changes in hold period assumptions for these assets. The total impairment loss recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately   $30.9 million   (see    Note 8    for details). During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized impairment charges of   $40.2 million   related to our 2 Gatehall Drive building and Eastpoint I   II buildings in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased   approximately   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased accruals for potential performance-based stock compensation due to our total stockholder return improving relative to the total stockholder returns of our predetermined peer group. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Interest expense   decreased   approximately   $7.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a net decrease in our average debt outstanding as we used a portion of the proceeds from our disposition activity in both 2015 and through September 30, 2016 to pay down secured debt and borrowings under our line of credit. 
    
  Other income/(expense) decreased approximately   $1.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. The variance is primarily attributable to interest income recognized on a note receivable extended to the purchaser of our Copper Ridge building during 2015, which was repaid in full in February 2016, and contributed approximately $1.1 million to the variance. The remainder of the variance is due to an increase in costs in the current period associated with the acquisition of new properties. 

Funds From Operations ( FFO ), Core FFO, and Adjusted Funds from Operations ( AFFO ) 
    
  Net income calculated in accordance with GAAP is the starting point for calculating FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO. These metrics are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of our operating performance to net income. Management believes that accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentation, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 

36 

     Table of Contents  

We calculate FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition. NAREIT currently defines FFO as follows: Net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment charges (including our proportionate share of any impairment charges and/or gains or losses from sales of property related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures), plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets (including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures). Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do; therefore, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
    
  We calculate Core FFO by starting with FFO, as defined by NAREIT, and adjusting for gains or losses on the extinguishment of swaps and/or debt, acquisition-related costs, and any significant non-recurring items. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. As a result, we believe that Core FFO can help facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and provides a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. Other REITs may not define Core FFO in the same manner as us; therefore, our computation of Core FFO may not be comparable to that of other REITs. 
    
  We calculate AFFO by starting with Core FFO and adjusting for non-incremental capital expenditures and acquisition-related costs and then adding back non-cash items including: non-real estate depreciation, straight-lined rents and fair value lease adjustments, non-cash components of interest expense and compensation expense, and by making similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that AFFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments. Other REITs may not define AFFO in the same manner as us; therefore, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to that of other REITs.

and building capital that do not incrementally enhance the underlying assets' income generating capacity. Tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building capital and deferred lease incentives incurred to lease space that was vacant at acquisition, leasing costs for spaces vacant for greater than one year, leasing costs for spaces at newly acquired properties for which in-place leases expire shortly after acquisition, improvements associated with the expansion of a building, and renovations that either enhance the rental rates of a building or change the property's underlying classification, such as from a Class B to a Class A property, are excluded from this measure. 

Property and Same Store Net Operating Income (Cash Basis) 
    
  Property Net Operating Income on a cash basis ("Property NOI") is a non-GAAP measure which we use to assess our operating results. We calculate Property NOI beginning with Net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and incrementally removing any impairment losses, gains or losses from sales of property and other significant infrequent items that create volatility within our earnings and make it difficult to determine the earnings generated by our core ongoing business. Furthermore, we adjust for general and administrative expense, income associated with property management performed by us for other organizations, and other income or expense items such as interest income from loan investments or costs from the pursuit of non-consummated transactions. Since we present this measure on a cash basis, the effects of straight lined rents and fair value lease revenue are also eliminated. Property NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Property NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of income generated by our properties alone without our administrative overhead. Other REITs may not define Property NOI in the same manner as we do; therefore, our computation of Property NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. 
    
  Since Property NOI is a metric based on the entire portfolio, it can be affected by the size and number of properties in our portfolio at any time. Due to a strong sellers' market in 2015 and 2016, we have been taking advantage of a favorable opportunity to dispose of non-strategic assets, and/or assets which we believe have maximized their value. In accordance with our announced strategy to focus on select sub-markets within our eight strategic office markets, we have disposed of seventeen assets, since January 1, 2015, including the sale of Aon Center. Aon Center was the largest individual asset within our portfolio prior to the sale, representing over 10% of the portfolio on a square footage basis. This strategy, we believe, will provide growth on a Same Store Net Operating Income on a cash basis ("Same Store NOI") and FFO per share basis, as well as improve the overall quality of our portfolio; however, as a result of this net disposition activity, our total Property NOI decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
    
  We calculate Same Store NOI as Property NOI attributable to the properties owned or placed in service during the entire span of the current and prior year reporting periods. Same Store NOI also excludes amounts attributable to unconsolidated joint venture assets. Same Store NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Same Store NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of the income generated from the same group of properties from one period to the next. Other REITs may not define Same Store NOI in the same manner as we do; therefore, our computation of Same Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Same Store NOI improved for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to improved occupancy and the expiration of rental abatements. 
    
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation from Net income calculated in accordance with GAAP to Property NOI and Same Store NOI for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands):

    Includes amounts applicable to consolidated properties and our proportionate share of amounts applicable to unconsolidated joint ventures.

    Other investments consist of operating results from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and redevelopment and development projects.  
       
  Overview 
    
  Our portfolio is a national portfolio located primarily in eight geographic markets. We typically lease space to large, credit-worthy corporate or governmental tenants on a long-term basis. Our average lease is approximately 23,000 square feet with   7.0 years   of lease term remaining as of September 30, 2016. As a result, leased percentage, as well as rent roll ups and roll downs, which we experience as a result of re-leasing, can fluctuate widely between markets, between buildings, and between tenants within a given market depending on when a particular lease is scheduled to expire.  

40 

     Table of Contents  

Leased Percentage 
    
  Excluding one property owned through an unconsolidated joint venture, two development properties, and one redevelopment property, our current in-service portfolio of   65   office properties was   93.4%   leased as of   September 30, 2016  , up from   90.6%   leased as of September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of transactional activity and the leasing of previously vacant space. As of   September 30, 2016  , scheduled lease expirations for the portfolio as a whole for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 were 0.5% and 6.7%, respectively, of our Annualized Lease Revenue; therefore, our current leasing efforts are primarily focused on continuing to increase our leased percentage by leasing currently vacant space. To the extent we are able to execute new leases for currently vacant space, offset by scheduled expirations, such new leasing should favorably impact our leased percentage, Property NOI, and possibly our Same Store NOI comparisons for our current in-service portfolio once any associated abatement periods expire. Our leased percentage may also fluctuate with the impact of various occupancy levels in our net acquisition and disposition activity. Additionally, our leased percentage will be reduced in early 2017 by placing in service our recently developed/re-developed assets: Enclave Place, 500 TownPark, and 3100 Clarendon Boulevard. 
    
  Impact of Downtime, Abatement Periods, and Rental Rate Changes 
    
  Commencement of new leases typically occurs 6-18 months from the lease execution date, after refurbishment of the space is completed. The downtime between a lease expiration and the new lease's commencement can negatively impact Property NOI and Same Store NOI. In addition, office leases, both new and lease renewals, often contain upfront rental and/or operating expense abatement periods which delay the cash flow benefits of the lease even after the new lease or renewal has commenced. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately 500,000 square feet of executed leases related to vacant space that had not yet commenced and approximately 900,000 square feet of commenced leases that were still in some form of abatement.  
    
  If we are unable to replace expiring leases with new or renewal leases at rental rates equal to or greater than the expiring rates, rental rate roll downs can also negatively impact Property NOI and Same Store NOI comparisons. As mentioned above, our geographically diverse portfolio and large block tenant model result in rent roll ups and roll downs that can fluctuate widely on a building by building basis. 
    
  Same Store NOI increased   4.5%   and   3.9%  , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of lease commencements and the expiration of rental abatements associated with several significant new leases. Property NOI and Same Store NOI comparisons for any given period may still fluctuate as a result of the mix of net leasing activity in individual properties during the respective period. 
    
  Election as a REIT 
    
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1998. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains applicable to our stockholders, as defined by the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we may be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost and/or penalties, unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to continue to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We have elected to treat Piedmont Office Holdings, Inc. ( POH ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Piedmont, as a taxable REIT subsidiary. POH performs non-customary services for tenants of buildings that we own, including solar power generation, real estate and non-real estate related-services; however, any earnings related to such services performed by our taxable REIT subsidiary are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, our investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries cannot exceed 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after 2017) of the value of our total assets.

Inflation 
    
  We are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax, and insurance reimbursements on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the leases may not readjust their reimbursement rates frequently enough to fully cover inflation. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We are not dependent on off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of one investment in an unconsolidated joint venture and operating lease obligations related to a ground lease at one of our properties. The unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold an investment is prohibited by its governing documents from incurring debt. For further information regarding our commitments under operating lease obligations, see the Contractual Obligations table below. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. The critical accounting policies outlined below have been discussed with members of the Audit Committee of the board of directors. 
    
  Investment in Real Estate Assets 
    
  We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our depreciable assets. We consider the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful lives. These assessments have a direct impact on net income applicable to Piedmont. The estimated useful lives of our assets by class are as follows: 
    
                 Buildings 
    40 years 
      Building improvements 
    5-25 years 
      Land improvements 
    20-25 years 
      Tenant allowances 
    Lease term 
      Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 
    3-5 years 
      Intangible lease assets 
    Lease term 

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities of Acquired Properties 
    
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, we record the fair value of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, based on their estimated fair values. 
    
  The estimated fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and buildings) are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the  as-if-vacant  value is then allocated to land and building based on management's determination of the estimated fair value of these assets. We determine the as-if-vacant estimated fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand. We also estimate the cost to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal, and other related costs. 

42 

     Table of Contents  

The estimated fair values of above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) our estimate of market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining terms of the leases, taking into consideration the probability of renewals for any below-market leases. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are recorded as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. 
    
  The estimated fair values of in-place leases include direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease, and tenant relationships. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs are included in deferred lease costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. Customer relationships are valued based on expected renewal of a lease or the likelihood of obtaining a particular tenant for other locations. These lease intangibles are included in intangible lease assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. 
    
  Estimating the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets requires us to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount and capitalization rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property is held for investment. The use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of our purchase price allocations, which would impact the amount of our reported net income applicable to Piedmont. 
    
  Valuation of Real Estate Assets and Investments in Joint Ventures Which Hold Real Estate Assets 
    
  We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of the real estate and related intangible assets, both operating properties and properties under construction, in which we have an ownership interest, either directly or through investments in joint ventures, may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present for wholly-owned properties, which indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered from the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we adjust the real estate and related intangible assets to the estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss. For our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, we assess the estimated fair value of our investment, as compared to our carrying amount. If we determine that the carrying value is greater than the estimated fair value at any measurement date, we must also determine if such a difference is temporary in nature. Value fluctuations which are  other than temporary  in nature are then recorded to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value amount. 
    
  Projections of expected future cash flows require that we estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, property operating expenses, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, and the number of years the property is held for investment, among other factors. The subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis, including capitalization and discount rates, could result in an incorrect assessment of the property s estimated fair value and, therefore, could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of our real estate and related intangible assets and our reported net income applicable to Piedmont. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase accounting for business combinations, as well as costs incurred as part of the acquisition. We test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Such interim circumstances may include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the general business climate, adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, the loss of key personnel, or persistent declines in an entity s stock price below carrying value of the entity. We have the option, should we choose to use it, to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we conclude that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if we chose to forgo the availability of the qualitative analysis, the test prescribed by authoritative accounting guidance is a two-step test. The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the entity to its carrying value, including goodwill. Estimated fair value is determined by adjusting the trading price of the stock for a control premium, if necessary, multiplied by the common shares outstanding. If such calculated estimated fair  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

value exceeds the carrying value, no further procedures or analysis is required. However, if the carrying value exceeds the calculated fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and step two of the analysis would be required. Step two of the test involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the entity from the entity s estimated fair value calculated in step one of the test. If the implied value of the goodwill (the remainder left after deducting the estimated fair values of the entity from its calculated overall estimated fair value in step one of the test) is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. We are not aware of any events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment of our carrying value of goodwill as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Investment in Variable Interest Entities 
    
  Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) are defined by GAAP as entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. If an entity is determined to be a VIE, it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses, or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns. Generally, expected losses and expected residual returns are the anticipated negative and positive variability, respectively, in the estimated fair value of the VIE s net assets. When we make an investment, we assess whether the investment represents a variable interest in a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Incorrect assumptions or assessments may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary. The result could be the consolidation of an entity acquired or formed in the future that would otherwise not have been consolidated or the non-consolidation of such an entity that would otherwise have been consolidated. 
    
  We evaluate each investment to determine whether it represents variable interests in a VIE. Further, we evaluate the sufficiency of the entities  equity investment at risk to absorb expected losses, and whether as a group, the equity has the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. See    Note 5    to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail on our investment in variable interest entities. 
    
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
    
  We periodically enter into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge our exposure to changing interest rates on variable rate debt instruments. As required by GAAP, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at estimated fair value. We reassess the effectiveness of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be highly effective and also to determine if the forecasted transactions remain highly probable. Currently, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  The changes in estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as effective cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income ( OCI ), and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions occur. Changes in the estimated fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, if any, would be recorded as gain/(loss) on interest rate swap in the consolidated statements of income. The estimated fair value of the interest rate derivative agreement is recorded as interest rate derivative asset or as interest rate derivative liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received or paid under interest rate derivative agreements are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated income statements as incurred. All of our interest rate derivative agreements as of   September 30, 2016   are designated as effective cash flow hedges. See    Note 6    to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail on our interest rate derivatives. 
    
  Stock-based Compensation 
    
  We have issued stock-based compensation in the form of restricted stock to our employees and directors. For employees, such compensation has been issued pursuant to our Long-term Incentive Compensation ("LTIC") program. The LTIC program is comprised of an annual deferred stock grant component and a multi-year performance share component. Awards granted pursuant to the annual deferred stock component are considered equity awards and expensed straight-line over the vesting period, with issuances recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital. Awards granted pursuant to the performance share component are considered liability awards and are expensed over the service period, with issuances recorded as a reduction to accrued expense. The compensation expense recognized related to both of these award types is recorded as property operating costs for those employees whose job is related to property operation and as general and administrative expense for all other employees and directors in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Further, we early adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). The provisions in ASU 2016-09 simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The implementation of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the reclassification

     Table of Contents  

of approximately   $1.7 million   related to income tax consequences for share-based compensation from cash outflows from operating activities to cash outflows from financing activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. See    Note 11    to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail on our stock-based compensation. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),     Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ("ASU 2016-05"). The amendments in ASU 2016-05 clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments in ASU 2016-05 are effective in the first quarter of 2017, and we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("ASU 2014-09") and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ("ASU 2016-08"). The amendments in ASU 2014-09, which are further clarified in ASU 2016-08, change the criteria for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services using a five-step determination process. Steps 1 through 5 involve (i) identifying contracts with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue as an entity satisfies a performance obligation. Additionally, lease contracts are specifically excluded from ASU 2014-09. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-08 are effective in the first quarter of 2018, and we are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01"). The amendments in ASU 2016-01 require equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, to be measured at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Additionally, ASU 2016-01 simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments, and eliminates certain disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective in the first quarter of 2018, and we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   ("ASU 2016-02"). The amendments in ASU 2016-02 fundamentally change definition of a lease, as well as the accounting for operating leases by requiring leasees to recognize assets and liabilities which arise from the lease, consisting of a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the leased asset over the term of the lease. Accounting for leases for lessors is substantially unchanged from prior practice, which means continuing to recognize lease revenue on a straight-line basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective in the first quarter of 2019, and we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326),     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). The provisions of ASU 2016-13 replace the "incurred loss" approach with an "expected loss" model for impairing trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investment in leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowance for losses. Additionally, the provisions change the classification of credit losses on available-for-sale securities as an allowance rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). The provisions of ASU 2016-15 provide clarity of treatment in the statement of cash flows for several transactions, including debt repayments or debt extinguishment costs, proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees, among several other topics. The FASB issued ASU 2016-15 in an effort to eliminate diversity in practice regarding treatment of specific transactions in the statements of cash flows for registrants. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption. 
    
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
    
  There were no related-party transactions during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

(1)   
    Amounts include principal payments only and balances outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , not including unamortized issuance discounts, debt issuance costs paid to lenders, or estimated fair value adjustments. We made interest payments, including payments under our interest rate swaps, of approximately   $53.2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and expect to pay interest in future periods on outstanding debt obligations based on the rates and terms disclosed herein and in    Note 4    of our accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
               (2)   
    Includes the $300 Million Unsecured 2013 Term Loan which has a stated variable rate; however, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix, exclusive of changes to our credit rating, the rate on this facility to   2.78%   through maturity. As such, we estimate incurring, exclusive of changes to our credit rating, approximately $8.3 million per annum in total interest (comprised of combination of variable contractual rate and settlements under interest rate swap agreements) through maturity in January 2019. 
               (3)   
    Includes the $300 Million Unsecured 2011 Term Loan which has a stated variable rate; however, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix, exclusive of changes to our credit rating, the rate on this facility to   2.39%   through the original maturity date of November 22, 2016 and   3.35%   for the extension period (November 22, 2016 to January 15, 2020). As such, we estimate incurring, exclusive of changes to our credit rating, approximately $7.2 million per annum in total interest (comprised of combination of variable contractual rate and settlements under interest rate swap agreements) through the original maturity of the debt facility in November 2016, and approximately $10.1 million per annum for the extension period ending in January 2020. 
               (4)   
    The 2001 NW 64th Street building in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida is subject to a ground lease with an expiration date in 2048. The aggregate remaining payments required under the terms of this operating lease as of   September 30, 2016   is presented above. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
  We are subject to certain commitments and contingencies with regard to certain transactions. Refer to    Note 9    of our consolidated financial statements for further explanation. Examples of such commitments and contingencies include: 
             
    Commitments Under Existing Lease Agreements; and 
                
    Contingencies Related to Tenant Audits/Disputes. 
      
           ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     Our future income, cash flows, and estimated fair values of our financial instruments depend in part upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. Our potential for exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with borrowings under our $500 Million Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit, our $300 Million Unsecured 2011 Term Loan, the $300 Million Unsecured 2013 Term Loan, and the $170 Million Unsecured 2015 Term Loan. As a result, the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow primarily through a low-to-moderate level of overall borrowings, as well as managing the variability in rate fluctuations on our outstanding debt. As such, all of our debt other than the $500 Million Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit and $170 Million Unsecured 2015 Term Loan is based on fixed or effectively-fixed interest rates to hedge against volatility in the credit markets. 
    
  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes, as such all of our debt and derivative instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately   $2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Our interest rate swap agreements in place at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   carried a notional amount totaling   $900 million   with a weighted-average fixed interest rate (not including the corporate credit spread) of   1.67%  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total outstanding debt subject to fixed, or effectively fixed, interest rates has an average effective interest rate of approximately   3.60%   per annum with expirations ranging from 2017 to 2024. A change in the market interest rate impacts the net financial instrument position of our fixed-rate debt portfolio but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. 
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $152.0 million   outstanding on our   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit. Our   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit currently has a stated rate of LIBOR plus   1.00%   per annum (based on our current corporate credit rating) or the prime rate, at our discretion. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate for all of the draws outstanding on our   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit was   1.53%  . The current stated interest rate spread on the $170 Million Unsecured 2015 Term Loan is LIBOR plus   1.125%   (based on our current corporate credit rating), which, as of   September 30, 2016  , was   1.66%  . To the extent that we borrow additional funds in the future under the   $500 Million   Unsecured 2015 Line of Credit or potential future variable-rate lines of credit, we would have exposure to increases in interest rates, which would potentially increase our cost of debt. Additionally, a 1.0% increase in variable interest rates on our existing outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   would increase interest expense approximately   $3.2 million   on a per annum basis. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Management s Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  Piedmont is not subject to any material pending legal proceedings. However, we are subject to routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of owning and operating real estate assets. Our management expects that these ordinary routine legal proceedings will be covered by insurance and does not expect these legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Additionally, management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
     There have been no known material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
              (a) 
    There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the   third   quarter   2016  . 
              (b) 
    Not applicable. 
              (c) 
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased shares of our common stock in the open market solely in order to reissue such shares under our dividend reinvestment plan (the "DRP"). Such stock repurchases for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

(1)   
    Under our amended and restated DRP, as set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 24, 2011, we have the option to either issue shares that we purchase in the open market or issue shares directly from Piedmont from authorized but unissued shares. Such election will take place at the settlement of each quarterly dividend in which there are participants in our DRP, and may change from quarter to quarter based on our judgment of the best use of proceeds for Piedmont. 
               (2)   
    Amounts available for purchase relate only to our stock repurchase plan, which was announced on June 24, 2015. Our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase plan through June 23, 2017. The share repurchase plan is separate from shares purchased for DRP issuance.
