  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (UNAUDITED) 

1.  
    Business and Organization 
     CNL Growth Properties, Inc. was organized in Maryland on December 12, 2008. The term  Company  includes, unless the context otherwise requires, CNL Growth Properties, Inc., Global Growth, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), Global Growth GP, LLC and other subsidiaries (including variable interest entities) of CNL Growth Properties, Inc. The Company operates, and has elected to be taxed, as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010. 
  On June 17, 2016, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC requesting, among other items, the stockholders' approval of a plan of liquidation and dissolution ("Plan of Dissolution") authorizing the Company to undertake an orderly liquidation.  On August 4, 2016, the Company's stockholders approved the Plan of Dissolution.  As a result of the adoption of the Plan of Dissolution, all of the Company's real estate properties are considered held for sale.  
  The Company is externally advised by CNL Global Growth Advisors, LLC (the  Advisor ) and its property manager is CNL Global Growth Managers, LLC (the  Property Manager ), each of which is an affiliate of CNL Financial Group, LLC, the Company s sponsor ( CNL  or the  Sponsor ). The Advisor is responsible for managing the Company s affairs on a day-to-day basis on behalf of the Company pursuant to an advisory agreement among the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor. 
  Substantially all of the Company s operating, administrative and certain property management services, are provided by sub-advisors to the Advisor and sub-property managers to the Property Manager.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned interests in   ten   Class A multifamily properties,   nine   of which were operational and as to which development was substantially complete and   one   of which was under development and partially operational. The Company had a total of   2,800   completed apartment units as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  All of the Company s multifamily properties are owned through joint ventures in which it has co-invested with an affiliate of a national or regional multifamily developer.  

2.  
    Plan of Dissolution 
     The Plan of Dissolution provides for an orderly sale of the Company's assets, payment of the Company's liabilities and other obligations, the winding up of operations and dissolution of the Company. The Company is permitted to provide for the payment of any unascertained or contingent liabilities and may do so by purchasing insurance, establishing a reserve fund or in other ways.   
  The Plan of Dissolution enables the Company to sell any and all of its assets without further approval of the stockholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the stockholders as determined by the Board. Pursuant to applicable REIT rules, in order to be able to deduct liquidating distributions as dividends, the Company must complete the disposition of its assets by August 5, 2018, two years after the date the Plan of Dissolution was adopted by stockholders. To the extent that all of the Company's assets are not sold by such date, the Company may transfer and assign its remaining assets to a liquidating trust.  Upon such transfer and assignment, its stockholders will receive interests in the liquidating trust.  The liquidating trust will pay or provide for all of the Company's liabilities and distribute any remaining net proceeds from the sale of its assets to the holders of interest in the liquidating trust.   
  The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to stockholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will ultimately be distributed to stockholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets.  
  The Company expects to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the liquidation until such time as any remaining assets, if any, are transferred into a liquidating trust. The Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to cause the Company to maintain its REIT status, provided however, the Board may elect to terminate the Company's status as a REIT if it determines that such termination would be in the best interest of the stockholders.

3.    
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Presentation   - As a result of the approval of the Plan of Dissolution by the stockholders in August 2016, the Company s financial position and results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 will be presented using two different presentations.  The Company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting ( Liquidation Basis ) as of August 1, 2016 and for the periods subsequent to August 1, 2016.  As a result, a new statement of financial position (Statement of Net Assets) is presented, which represents the estimated amount of cash that the Company will collect on disposal of assets as it carries out its Plan of Dissolution.  In addition, a new statement of operations (Statement of Changes in Net Assets) will reflect changes in net assets from the original estimated values as of August 1, 2016 through the most recent period presented, as further described below. 
  All financial results and disclosures up through July 31, 2016, prior to adopting the Liquidation Basis of accounting, will be presented based on a going concern basis ( Going Concern Basis ), which contemplated the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the statements of operations and the statements of cash flows for the seven months ended July 31, 2016 and the comparative nine months ended September 30, 2015 used the Going Concern Basis presentation consistent in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as further described below. 
  Basis of Presentation Liquidation Basis (Post Plan of Dissolution)     As a result of the approval of the Plan of Dissolution by the stockholders, the Company has adopted the Liquidation Basis of accounting as of August 1, 2016 and for the periods subsequent to August 1, 2016 in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, on August 1, 2016 assets were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, which represents the estimated amount of cash that the Company will collect on disposal of assets as it carries out its Plan of Dissolution. The liquidation value of the Company's operating properties are presented on an undiscounted basis. Estimated costs to dispose of assets have been presented separately from the related assets. Liabilities are carried at their contractual amounts due or estimated settlement amounts.  
  The Company accrues costs and income that it expects to incur and earn through the end of liquidation to the extent it has a reasonable basis for estimation. These amounts are classified as a liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. Actual costs and income may differ from amounts reflected in the financial statements because of inherent uncertainty in estimating future events. These differences may be material. See Note 4, "Liability for Estimated Costs in Excess of Estimated Receipts During Liquidation" for further discussion. Actual costs incurred but unpaid as of September 30, 2016 are included in accrued development costs, accounts payable and other accrued expenses, due to related parties and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets.  
  In liquidation, the presentation for joint ventures historically consolidated under going concern accounting will be determined based on the Company's planned exit strategy. The Company intends to sell all of its properties, rather than selling its interest in its properties, and therefore the properties will be presented on a gross basis with a liability to the non-controlling interest holders. Amounts due to non-controlling interests in connection with the disposition of consolidated joint ventures have been accrued and are recorded as liability for non-controlling interests.  
  Net assets in liquidation represents the estimated liquidation value available to stockholders upon liquidation. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of the anticipated sale dates and the estimated cash flows, actual operating results and sale proceeds may differ materially from the amounts estimated.  
  Noncontrolling Interesets   -   Liquidation Basis (Post Plan of Dissolution)   - Under liquidation accounting, the presentation for joint ventures historically consolidated under going concern accounting will be presented on a gross basis with a liability to the noncontrolling interest partner. 
  Basis of Presentation   -   Going Concern Basis (Pre Plan of Dissolution)  - The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements through July 31, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ( GAAP ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the periods ended July 31, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. Amounts as of December 31, 2015 included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with

3.    
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     (continued) 
     the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Consolidation and Variable Interest Entities         The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries over which it has control. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with the guidance for the consolidation of a variable interest entity ( VIE ), the Company analyzes its variable interests, including loans, leases, guarantees, and equity investments, to determine if the entity in which it has a variable interest is a VIE. The Company s analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. The Company bases its quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity and its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. The Company also uses its quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and if such determination is made, it includes the accounts of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements. 
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)       Going Concern Basis (Pre Plan of Dissolution)     The Company had no items of other comprehensive income (loss) through July 31, 2016 and therefore, did not include other comprehensive income (loss) or total comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications     Real estate balances for the   four   properties identified for sale during the seven months ended July 31, 2016 were reclassified to real estate held for sale in the December 31, 2015 condensed balance sheet. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income (loss) or equity. See Note 7.  Real Estate Held for Sale, Dispositions and Discontinued Operations  for additional information. 
  Income Taxes     The Company has elected and qualified as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010. As a REIT, the Company generally is subject to federal corporate income taxes and may be subject to excise tax on undistributed taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to certain state and local taxes on is income and property. 
  Adopted Accounting Pronouncements       Going Concern Basis (Pre Plan of Dissolution)     In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which requires amendments to both the VIE and voting models. The amendments (i) modify the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), the VIE characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and primary beneficiary determination under the VIE model, and (ii) eliminate the presumption within the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity. The new guidance was effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  
  The amendments could be applied using either a modified retrospective or full retrospective approach. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not result in any changes to conclusions about whether the Company s   ten   joint ventures were VIEs or whether the Company was the primary beneficiary for each of its joint ventures.

3.    
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     (continued) 
     In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires that loan costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The new guidance was effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The ASU was required to be applied retrospectively for each period presented. Upon adoption, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016; the adoption of which impacted the Company s presentation of its consolidated financial position but did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has retrospectively adjusted the presentation of loan costs for all periods presented prior to the adoption of Liquidation Basis of accounting. The following table provides additional details by financial statement line item of the adjusted presentation in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  : 

4.    
    Liability for Estimated Costs in Excess of Estimated Receipts During Liquidation 
     The liquidation basis of accounting requires the Company to estimate net cash flows from operations and to accrue all costs associated with implementing and completing the Plan of Dissolution. The Company currently estimates that it will have costs in excess of estimated receipts during the liquidation. These amounts can vary significantly due to, among other things, the timing and estimates for lease-up, the timing of property sales, direct costs incurred to complete the sales, the timing and amounts associated with discharging known and contingent liabilities and the costs associated with the winding up of operations. These costs are estimated and are anticipated to be paid out over the liquidation period.  
  Upon transition to the liquidation basis of accounting on August 1, 2016, the Company accrued the following revenues and expenses expected to be incurred during liquidation:

4.    
    Liability for Estimated Costs in Excess of Estimated Receipts During Liquidation     (continued) 
     The change in the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

5.    
    Net Assets in Liquidation 
     The following is a reconciliation of Shareholder s Equity under the going concern basis of accounting to net assets in liquidation under the liquidation basis of accounting as of August 1, 2016:  

Net assets in liquidation   decreased   by approximately   $52.9 million   during the period August 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. The primary reason for the decline in net assets was due to the special liquidating distributions to stockholders declared and paid of approximately   $52.9 million  , or   $2.35   per common share, in August 2016.  
  The net assets in liquidation at   September 30, 2016   would result in liquidating distributions of approximately   $7.21   per share. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the Plan of Dissolution.  There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, the performance of the underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows.  

6. 
    Real Estate Assets, net 
     As a result of adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting in August 2016, as of   September 30, 2016  , real estate assets were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, which represents the estimated amount of cash that the Company will collect on disposal of assets as it carries out its Plan of Dissolution.

    Real Estate Assets, net     (continued) 
     Prior to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, and after reclassification of the   four   assets identified for sale during the seven months ended July 31, 2016 to real estate held for sale, real estate assets consisted of the following at December 31, 2015: 

For the   seven months ended July 31, 2016   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , depreciation expense on the Company s real estate assets was approximately   $5.4 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively, including approximately   $0.9 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   one month ended July 31, 2016   and the   quarter ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

7.  
    Real Estate Held for Sale, Dispositions and Discontinued Operations 
     During   2016  , the   three   joint ventures owning the Aura Castle Hills, Aura Grand and REALM Patterson Place properties each decided to pursue a potential sale of its respective property.  The Company also decided to pursue the sale of its wholly owned Whitehall property, and as of such time, the Company reclassified the presentation of these   four   properties to held for sale at December 31, 2015 as follows: 

Prior to adopting the Liquidation Basis of accounting, in June 2016, the Company sold the Aura Castle Hills and REALM Patterson Place properties.  No disposition fee was payable to the Advisor on the sale of these properties. In connection with the sale of the Aura Castle Hills and REALM Patterson Place properties, the Company received aggregate sales proceeds net of closing costs of approximately   $110.0 million  , resulting in aggregate gains of approximately   $40.9 million  , net of tax of approximately   $0.1 million  , for financial reporting purposes, which was included in income from continuing operations for the seven months ended July 31, 2016,  in the accompanying Going Concern Basis condensed consolidated statement of operations.  Of the aggregate gains, net of tax, of approximately   $40.9 million  , approximately   $18.5 million   was allocable to common stockholders. 
  In August 2016, the Company sold the Whitehall property for gross sales proceeds of approximately   $51.2 million   which equaled the liquidation value at August 1, 2016.  After the payment of closing costs, the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $50.7 million  . No disposition fee was payable to the Advisor on the sale of the Whitehall property.

    Real Estate Held for Sale, Dispositions and Discontinued Operations     (continued) 
     Through July 31, 2016, prior to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, the Company accounted for the revenues and expenses related to the   four   properties classified as held for sale as income from continuing operations because the disposition of these   four   properties on an individual basis would neither cause a strategic shift in the Company nor were they considered to have a major impact on the Company s business. Therefore, they did not qualify as discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08, which became effective on January 1, 2015. However, the proposed dispositions of the   four   properties represent individually significant components. The Company recorded net income (loss) from continuing operations related to the   four   properties of approximately   $0.1 million   for the   one month ended July 31, 2016  , of which approximately   $0.1 million   is attributable to common stockholders, and approximately   $43.1 million   (including aggregate gain on sale of real estate, net of tax of approximately   $40.9 million  ) for the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  , of which approximately   $20.3 million   (including aggregate gain on sale of real estate, net of tax, of approximately   $18.5 million  ) is attributable to common stockholders. 
    
  During   2014  , prior to the Company's adoption of ASU 2014-08, the Company entered into a contract to sell the Long Point Property. As a result, the financial statements reflect the reclassifications of rental income, interest expense and other categories relating to the Long Point Property from loss from continuing operations to income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. In January   2015  , the Company sold the Long Point Property, received sales proceeds net of closing costs of approximately   $54.4   million, resulting in a gain of approximately   $27.4   million for financial reporting purposes (of which approximately   $13.9 million   is attributable to common stockholders), which were included in income from discontinued operations for the applicable   nine months ended September 30, 2015   in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  There were   no   discontinued operations for the one and   seven months ended July 31, 2016  . The following is a summary of income from discontinued operations for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company's real estate assets are considered held for sale due to the adoption of Liquidation Basis of accounting effective August 1, 2016, as discussed above in Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."  

8. 
    Indebtedness 
     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company borrowed approximately   $65.1 million   under its contractual loans in connection with its multifamily development projects.  The Company, through joint ventures formed to make investments, generally has borrowed on a non-recourse basis to fund construction. The use of non-recourse financing allows the Company to limit its exposure on any investment to the amount invested. Non-recourse indebtedness means the indebtedness of the borrower or its subsidiaries is collateralized only by the assets to which such indebtedness relates, without recourse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

    Indebtedness     (continued) 
     The Company repaid mortgage and construction notes payable of approximately   $79.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily using net proceeds from the sale of the Patterson Place, Aura Castle Hills and Whitehall properties.   
  Mortgage loans payable are carried at their contractual amounts due under liquidation accounting.  The Company had outstanding mortgage loans payable of   $255.0 million   and   $269.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

  In connection with the adoption of the plan of dissolution, the Company accrues costs it expects to incur through the end of the liquidation.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has accrued asset management fees of approximately   $1.4 million  , property management fees of approximately   $0.03 million  , and liquidation transaction costs of approximately   $2.4 million  .

    Stockholder s Equity 
     In February and December 2015, the Company s board of directors declared special cash distributions of approximately   $29.3 million   and   $38.3 million  , respectively, representing   $1.30   and   $1.70  , respectively, per share of common stock (the  Special Cash Distributions ).   
  No   special cash distributions were declared during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  .  In August 2016, the Company declared and paid a liquidating distribution of   $52.9 million  , or   $2.35   per share of common stock.   

11. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     From time to time, the Company may be a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of, or incidental to the normal course of, its business, including proceedings to enforce the Company's contractual or statutory rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe the final outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. 
  Pursuant to the development agreements for the Company s multifamily development properties under construction as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has committed to fund approximately   $6.0 million   in remaining development and other costs as of   September 30, 2016  . The remaining development costs are expected to be funded primarily by the construction loans relating to such properties. The Company s joint venture partners and certain of their affiliates have committed to fund any cost overruns related to the development projects. 

In October 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Aura Grand property for gross sales proceeds of approximately   $41.2 million  , which equaled the property's liquidation value as of August 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016.  The Company used a portion of the sales proceeds to repay the construction loan payable related to this property.  No disposition fee was payable to the Advisor on the sale of the Aura Grand property.  
  In October 2016, the City Walk Joint Venture, the Company's consolidated joint venture which developed the City Walk Property, modified its original development and construction loan to extend the original maturity date of November 15, 2016 to December 15, 2016.

  OVERVIEW 
  CNL Growth Properties, Inc. was organized as a Maryland corporation on December 12, 2008 and has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. The terms  us,   we,   our,   our Company  and  CNL Growth Properties, Inc.  include CNL Growth Properties, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries. 
  On June 17, 2016, we filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC requesting, among other items, our stockholders' approval of a plan of liquidation and dissolution ("Plan of Dissolution") authorizing us to undertake an orderly liquidation.  In an orderly liquidation, we would sell of all of our remaining assets, pay all of our known liabilities, provide for the payment of our unknown or contingent liabilities, distribute our remaining cash to our stockholders as liquidating distributions, wind-up our operations and dissolve the Company in accordance with Maryland law. On August 4, 2016, our stockholders approved the Company's Plan of Dissolution pursuant to which our Board of Directors is authorized to undertake a sale of all of the Company's assets and distribute the net proceeds to our stockholders after payment of all of the Company's liabilities.  See the Company's Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2016 for additional details.  
  As a result of the approval of the Plan of Dissolution by the stockholders in August 2016, we adopted the Liquidation Basis of accounting, as described further in Note 1, "Business and Organization" to the financial statements.   
  Our Advisor and Property Manager 
  We are externally advised by CNL Global Growth Advisors, LLC (the  Advisor ) and our property manager is CNL Global Growth Managers, LLC (the  Property Manager ), each of which is an affiliate of CNL Financial Group, LLC, our sponsor ( CNL  or the  Sponsor ), a private investment management firm specializing in alternative investment products. The Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, recommending and executing acquisitions (through the completion of our acquisition stage in April 2015) and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement. 
  Substantially all of our operating, administrative and property management services are provided by sub-advisors to the Advisor and by sub-property managers to the Property Manager.  
  Exit Strategy 
  Due to the completion of our Offerings in April 2014, the completion of our acquisition phase in April 2015 and the estimated time needed to complete our development phase and have our assets substantially stabilize, our Advisor began to explore strategic alternatives. In August 2015, our board of directors appointed a special committee comprised of our independent board members (the  Special Committee ) to oversee the process of exploring strategic alternatives for future stockholder liquidity, including opportunities to merge with another company, the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, our sale or the sale of all of our assets. In September 2015, we engaged CBRE Capital Advisors, Inc. ( CBRE Cap ) to act as our exclusive financial advisor and assist us and the Special Committee with this process. In the ordinary course of CBRE Cap s business, CBRE Cap, its affiliates, directors and officers, may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions in our shares or assets for its own account or for the accounts of its customers and accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position, finance positions, or otherwise structure and effect transactions in our shares or assets. CBRE Cap is an affiliate of CBRE Group, Inc. ( CBRE ), the parent holding company of affiliated companies that are engaged in the ordinary course of business in many areas related to commercial real estate and related services. Through CBRE s affiliates, CBRE may have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, perform one or more roles in our transactions. Refer to  Our Real Estate Portfolio  below for a discussion on properties sold during 2015 and 2016. 
  Although our stockholders approved our Plan of Dissolution on August 4, 2016, there is no assurance we will have a liquidity event in the near term. We expect to distribute all of the net proceeds from the sale of our assets to our stockholders within 24 months after the stockholder approval  of our Plan of Dissolution. However, if we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts within 24 months, or if our Board and the Special Committee determine that it is otherwise advisable to do so, we may transfer and assign our remaining assets to a liquidating trust. Upon such transfer and assignment, our stockholders will receive interests in the liquidating trust. The liquidating trust will pay or provide for all of our liabilities and distribute any remaining net proceeds from the sale of its assets to the holders of interests in the liquidating trust. 
  The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to stockholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will ultimately be distributed to stockholders and no assurance  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents   

can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets.  
  We expect to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the liquidation until such time as any remaining assets, if any, are transferred into a liquidating trust. Our board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to cause us to maintain our REIT status, provided however, our board may elect to terminate our status as a REIT if it determines that such termination would be in the best interest of our stockholders.   
  Our Real Estate Portfolio 
  During the seven months ended September 30, 2016 (prior to adopting the Liquidation Basis of accounting), we, through our consolidated joint ventures, sold two real estate properties that were operational.  Subsequent to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, we sold our wholly owned property.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in   ten   Class A multifamily properties in the southeastern and sunbelt regions of the United States,   nine   of which had substantially completed development and were operational. The remaining   one   property was under development and was partially operational, with substantial completion achieved in October 2016. We generally expect our multifamily properties to reach stabilization within 24 months after completion. 
  We had a total of   2,800   completed apartment units as of   September 30, 2016  , and will have   2,820   units once construction is completed on our remaining property under development. 
  Our multifamily properties are typically owned through a joint venture in which we have co-invested with an affiliate of a national or regional multifamily developer. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had co-invested in   ten   separate joint ventures with eight separate developers or affiliates thereof. Our joint ventures are structured such that we serve as the managing member and own a majority interest. Under the terms of the limited liability company agreements of each joint venture, operating cash flow is generally distributed to the members of the joint venture on a pro rata basis. Generally, in a capital event, such as a sale or refinancing of the joint venture s property, net proceeds will be distributed pro rata to each member until each member s invested capital is returned and a minimum return on capital is achieved, and thereafter our joint venture partner will receive a disproportionately higher share of any proceeds at varying levels based on our having received certain minimum threshold returns. We have determined that all of the joint ventures in which we have co-invested as of   September 30, 2016   are variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. As such, the transactions and accounts of the joint ventures are consolidated in our accompanying condensed financial statements. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash totaled   $21.7 million   and consisted primarily of net proceeds from sales of real estate and cash from unused offering proceeds.  We may retain a portion of our cash on hand or use debt and/or equity proceeds for capital needs and any other corporate purposes deemed appropriate.   
  Our total assets and net assets in liquidation were   $516.8 million   and   $162.4 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . Our ability to meet our obligations is contingent upon the disposition of our assets in accordance with our Plan of Dissolution.  We estimate that the proceeds from the sale of assets pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution will be adequate to pay our obligations, however, we cannot provide any assurance as to the prices or net proceeds we will receive from the disposition of our assets.    
  Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Borrowings 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we borrowed approximately   $65.1 million   under our various construction loans to pay for development costs relating to several of our properties owned, of which approximately   $53.6 million   was borrowed during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  . 
  Sales of Real Estate 
  During January and February 2016, as a result of evaluation of strategic alternatives, we decided to pursue a potential sale of four additional properties. In June 2016, the REALM Patterson Place and Aura Castle Hills Properties sold and we received sales proceeds net of closing costs of   $110.0 million  .  We used a portion of the net sales proceeds from the sale of those two properties to repay the development and construction loans related to both properties, and also paid distributions in June and July to our respective co-venture partners of each of the REALM Patterson Place Joint Venture and Aura Castle Hills Joint Venture, respectively, in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreements.  
  In August 2016, subsequent to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, we sold the Whitehall Property for gross sales proceeds of approximately   $51.2 million  , which equaled the liquidation value at August 1, 2016.  We received proceeds, net of closing costs, of approximately   $50.7 million   and used a portion of the net sales proceeds to repay the mortgage note payable related to  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents   

this property.  In October 2016, we sold the Aura Grand property for gross sales proceeds of approximately   $41.2 million  , which equaled the liquidation value at August 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we sold the Long Point and Crescent Alexander Village properties. In connection with these transactions, the joint ventures that owned these two properties received aggregate sales proceeds net of closing costs of approximately   $106.1 million  , and through our consolidated joint ventures, we used the net sales proceeds from the sales of these two properties to repay the mortgage and construction note payables collateralized by the properties.  
  We intend to use a portion of the net sales proceeds from properties sold in 2016 for general corporate purposes and for     liquidating distributions to stockholders.  
  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Prior to the adoption of Liquidation Basis of accounting, our net cash flows provided by operating activities was approximately   $0.3 million   and   $5.6 million   for the   seven months ended July 31, 2016   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Cash flows from operating activities declined during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  , primarily due to the sale of four operational properties in 2015 and an increase in general and administrative expenses, asset management fees, and property management fees as a result of additional properties and units being operational.  Cash flows from operating activities also declined due to an increase in professional fees related to our exit strategy.  
  Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Development of Properties 
  In connection with our development projects, we funded approximately   $65.1 million   in development costs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , of which approximately   $53.4 million   was funded during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  . Pursuant to the development agreements for the properties under development, as of   September 30, 2016   we had commitments to fund approximately   $6.0 million   in additional development and other costs. We expect to fund the remaining development costs primarily from the construction loans on each property. 
  Debt Service 
  We, along with our joint venture partners, have and may extend and refinance the construction loans on our development properties with longer term debt as our properties  operations stabilize. However, our ability to continue to obtain indebtedness could be adversely affected if our joint venture partners do not agree to the extension or by credit market conditions, which result in lenders reducing or limiting funds available for loans, including loans collateralized by real estate. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid   $79.4 million   of mortgage and construction loans payable (of which approximately   $51.2 million   was paid during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016  ), which included the early repayment of approximately   $79.1 million   using a portion of the net sales proceeds from the sale of the REALM Patterson Place, Aura Castle Hills and Whitehall properties.   
  As our indebtedness approaches maturity, we, along with our joint venture partners, may extend and refinance the construction loans on our development properties, or may determine to sell the property and use proceeds from the sale to repay the indebtedness.  In September 2016, we extended the original construction loan relating to our Remington Fairfield Property by one year to September 2017. 
  Distributions to Noncontrolling Interests 
  The terms of each joint venture structure are generally market driven and consider the assumption of certain risks by our joint venture partners, including; entitlements, permitting, exposure to costs in excess of the project budget, interest rates, and lender guarantees. In accordance with preferred return provisions in the respective joint venture agreements, upon a sale of the joint venture s property, the joint venture partner may be entitled to a disproportionately higher share of proceeds than their member interest if certain threshold returns are met. Each structure is individually negotiated and terms of the waterfall structure can be influenced by market size and attractiveness of the investment fundamentals, leverage assumptions, and equity contributions from our joint venture partners. 
    
  Prior to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, during the   seven months ended July 31, 2016   our consolidated joint ventures paid distributions of approximately   $27.1 million   to our co-venture partners representing approximately   $1.3 million   from their pro rata share of positive operating cash flows, plus approximately   $25.8 million   from a disproportionate share of proceeds from capital events relating to net sales proceeds from the sale of the REALM Patterson Place and Aura Castle Hills properties, in accordance with the terms of our joint venture agreements.

     Table of Contents   

Special Liquidating Distributions 
  Subsequent to adopting Liquidation Basis of accounting, in August 2016, our board approved a special liquidating distribution of   $52.9 million  , or   $2.35   per common share, to our stockholders.   
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
   
  Comparability of Financial Data from Period to Period  
  Under going concern accounting, the comparability of financial data from period to period was primarily affected by (i) the timing of the completion of our development properties and leasing activities, and (ii) the sales of real estate assets.   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  In light of the adoption of Liquidation Basis accounting as of August 1, 2016, the results of operations for the current year periods are not comparable to the prior year periods. Our remaining assets which had completed construction and reached stabilization in prior periods continue to perform in a manner that is relatively consistent with prior reporting periods and we have experienced no significant changes in leased percentages or rental rates at these properties. Our remaining assets which had not completed construction or reached stabilization in prior periods have continued to place additional units into service and increase overall leased percentages.   
  Due to the adoption of the Plan of Dissolution we are no longer reporting funds from operations as we no longer consider this to be a key performance measure.  
  Changes in Net Assets in Liquidation 
  Period from August 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016    
  Net assets in liquidation   decreased   by approximately   $52.9 million   during the period August 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  .  The primary reason for the decline in net assets was due to the special liquidating distributions to stockholders of approximately   $52.9 million  , or   $2.35   per common share, in August 2016.  

RELATED PARTY ARRANGEMENTS 
  We have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory services, asset and property management fees and reimbursement of operating costs.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire and develop properties and to make loans and other permitted investments, if any. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we expect to borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available, and in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. With regard to variable rate financing, we will assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. 
  The following is a schedule of our variable rate debt maturities for each of the next five years, and thereafter, assuming the terms of the loans are not extended (principal maturities only): 

FOOTNOTE: 
    
           (1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we were paying the interest rate floor on certain of our variable rate debts. 
     Management estimates that a hypothetical one-percentage point increase in LIBOR compared to the LIBOR rate as of   September 30, 2016  , would increase interest expense by approximately   $0.6   million and   $1.7   million on our variable rate debt for the quarter and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. This sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions, and although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates, it is not intended to predict future results and our actual results will likely vary. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the most recent fiscal quarter, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
  Other Matters 
  In connection with the adoption of liquidation basis accounting, during the most recent quarter (i) certain of our internal controls over financial reporting became no longer relevant primarily relating to asset impairments and (ii) we adopted additional internal controls over financial reporting primarily with respect to the calculations of our asset values for liquidation accounting purposes.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors          
  The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are the material risks of which our stockholders should be aware. However, additional risks that are not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are not material, may also prove to be important. 
  RISKS THAT MAY DELAY OR REDUCE OUR LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS 
  As we continue to pursue a complete liquidation of our remaining assets, the net proceeds are expected to range between approximately $8.41 and $9.39 per share, including the $2.35 per share we paid to stockholders in August 2016.  Taking into account the special cash distributions stockholders received of $3.00 per share in 2015 in connection with the prior sales of five of our properties in 2014 and 2015, we estimate the total amount stockholders could receive is between approximately $11.41 and $12.39 per share, for which we anticipate paying the balance within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Dissolution which occurred on August 4, 2016.  However, our expectations about the amount of liquidating distributions that we will make and when we will make them are based on many estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect.  As a result, the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to stockholders may be more or less than we estimate. In addition, the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict.  For each property, our joint venture partner must consent to the property s listing and sale, which may further delay the sale process. Although the current net asset value per share on a liquidation basis of accounting at September 30, 2016 of our remaining assets is higher than the range of liquidation values set forth above that our Board estimated at the time the Plan of Dissolution was approved for submission to the stockholders, we note that the net asset value per share on a liquidation basis of accounting does not take into account the various valuation methodologies disclosed and discussed in the proxy statement provided to stockholders in connection with the approval of the Plan of Dissolution or reflect the remaining uncertainties associated with continuing to own and operate our remaining properties and to complete the sale of our properties. In addition to the risks that we generally face in our business, factors that could cause actual payments to be lower or made later than we expect include, among others, the risks set forth below: 
  If any of the parties to our future sale agreements default thereunder, or if these sales do not otherwise close, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced. 
  In light of the approval by the Company s stockholders on August 4, 2016 of the Plan of Dissolution, we will seek to enter into binding sale agreements for each of our properties. The consummation of the potential sales for which we will enter into sale agreements in the future will be subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. If any of the transactions contemplated by these future sale agreements do not close because of a buyer default, failure of a closing condition or for any other reason, we will need to locate a new buyer for the assets which we may be unable to do promptly or at prices or on terms that are as favorable as the original sale agreement. We will also incur additional costs involved in locating a new buyer and negotiating a new sale agreement for this asset. These additional costs are not included in our projections. In the event that we incur these additional costs, our liquidating payments to our stockholders would be delayed or reduced. 
  If we are unable to find buyers for our assets at our expected sales prices, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced. 
  In calculating our estimated range of liquidating distributions, we assumed that we will be able to find buyers for all of our assets at amounts based on our estimated range of market values for each property. However, we may have overestimated the sales prices that we will ultimately be able to obtain for these assets. For example, in order to find buyers in a timely manner, we may be required to lower our asking price below the low end of our current estimate of the property s market value. If we are not able to find buyers for these assets in a timely manner or if we have overestimated the sales prices we will receive, our liquidating payments to our stockholders would be delayed or reduced. Furthermore, the projected liquidating distribution is based upon the Advisor s estimates of the range of market value for each property, but real estate market values are constantly changing and fluctuate with changes in interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, occupancy percentages, lease rates, the availability of suitable buyers, the perceived quality and dependability of income flows from tenancies and a number of other factors, both local and national. In addition, minority ownership matters, transactional fees and expenses, environmental contamination at our properties or unknown liabilities, if any, may adversely impact the net liquidation proceeds from those assets. 
    
  If our liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents   

Before making the final liquidating distribution, we will need to pay or arrange for the payment of all of our transaction costs in the liquidation, all other costs and all valid claims of our creditors. Our Board may also decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, for which we would pay a premium which has not yet been determined. Our Board may also decide to establish a reserve fund to pay these contingent claims. The amounts of transaction costs in the liquidation are not yet final, so we have used estimates of these costs in calculating the amounts of our projected liquidating distributions. To the extent that we have underestimated these costs in calculating our projections, our actual net liquidation value may be lower than our estimated range. In addition, if the claims of our creditors are greater than we have anticipated or we decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced. Further, if a reserve fund is established, payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders may be delayed or reduced. 
  Pursuing the Plan of Dissolution may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, which would dramatically lower the amount of our liquidating distributions. 
  For so long as we qualify as a REIT and distribute all of our taxable income, we generally are not subject to federal income tax. Although our Board does not presently intend to terminate our REIT status prior to the final distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of our assets and our dissolution, our Board may take actions pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution that would result in such a loss of REIT status. Upon the final distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of our assets and our dissolution, our existence and our REIT status will terminate. However, there is a risk that our actions in pursuit of the Plan of Dissolution may cause us to fail to meet one or more of the requirements that must be met in order to qualify as a REIT prior to completion of the Plan of Dissolution. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 75% of our gross income must come from real estate sources and 95% of our gross income must come from real estate sources and certain other sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws, mainly interest and dividends. We may encounter difficulties satisfying these requirements as part of the liquidation process. In addition, in connection with that process, we may recognize ordinary income in excess of the cash received. The REIT rules require us to pay out a large portion of our ordinary income in the form of a dividend to our stockholders. However, to the extent that we recognize ordinary income without any cash available for distribution, and if we were unable to borrow to fund the required dividend or find another way to meet the REIT distribution requirements, we may cease to qualify as a REIT. While we expect to comply with the requirements necessary to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, if we are unable to do so, we will, among other things (unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions): 
             
    not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income; 
                
    be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income, including recognized gains, at regular corporate rates; 
                
    be subject to increased state and local taxes; and 
                
    be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the taxable year in which we lose our qualification and for the four following taxable years. 
     As a result of these consequences, our failure to qualify as a REIT could substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. 
    
  Pursuing the Plan of Dissolution may cause us to be subject to federal income tax, which would reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions. 
  We generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute to our stockholders during each taxable year (or, under certain circumstances, during the subsequent taxable year) dividends equal to our taxable income for the year. However, we are subject to federal income tax to the extent that our taxable income exceeds the amount of dividends paid to our stockholders for the taxable year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that year, plus 95% of our capital gain net income for that year, plus 100% of our undistributed taxable income from prior years. While we intend to make distributions to our stockholders sufficient to avoid the imposition of any federal income tax on our taxable income and the imposition of the excise tax, differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of such income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our taxable income, could cause us to have to either borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, find another alternative for meeting the REIT distribution requirements, or pay federal income and excise taxes. The cost of borrowing or the payment of federal income and excise taxes would reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders.

So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, any net gain from  prohibited transactions  will be subject to a 100% tax.  Prohibited transactions  are sales of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. The prohibited transactions tax is intended to prevent a REIT from retaining any profit from ordinary retailing activities such as sales to customers of condominium units or subdivided lots in a development project. The Code provides for a  safe harbor  which, if all its conditions are met, would protect a REIT s property sales from being considered prohibited transactions. Whether a real estate asset is property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a highly factual determination. We believe that all of our properties are held for investment and the production of rental income, and that none of the sales of our properties will constitute a prohibited transaction. We do not believe that the sales of the Company s properties pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution should be subject to the prohibited transactions tax. However, due to the anticipated sales volume and other factors, the contemplated sales may not qualify for the protective safe harbor. We have received an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm concluding that the sales of our properties in anticipation of, simultaneous and subsequent to the adoption of the Plan of Dissolution should not constitute prohibited transactions within the meaning of the Code. This opinion is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service which may assert that the contemplated sales are subject to the prohibited transactions tax. There can, however, be no assurances that the IRS will not successfully challenge the characterization of properties we hold for purposes of applying the prohibited transaction tax. 
  Distributing interests in a liquidating trust may cause our stockholders to recognize gain prior to the receipt of cash. 
  The REIT provisions of the Code generally require that each year we distribute as a dividend to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). Liquidating distributions we make pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution will qualify for the dividends paid deduction, provided that they are made within 24 months of the adoption of such plan. Conditions may arise which cause us not to be able to liquidate within such 24-month period. For instance, it may not be possible to sell our assets at acceptable prices during such period. In such event, rather than retain our assets and risk losing our status as a REIT, we may elect to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust in order to meet the 24-month requirement. We may also elect to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust within such 24-month period to avoid the costs of operating as a public company. Such a transfer would be treated as a distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders, followed by a contribution of the assets to the liquidating trust. As a result, a Company stockholder would recognize gain to the extent such stockholder s share of the cash and the fair market value of any assets received by the liquidating trust was greater than the stockholder s basis in the stock, notwithstanding that the stockholder would not contemporaneously receive a distribution of cash or any other assets with which to satisfy the resulting tax liability. See  Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences -United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Stockholders  on page 43. In addition, it is possible that the fair market value of the assets received by the liquidating trust, as estimated for purposes of determining the extent of the stockholder s gain at the time interests in the liquidating trust are distributed to the stockholders, will exceed the cash or fair market value of property received by the liquidating trust on a sale of the assets. In this case, the stockholder would recognize a loss in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the gain was recognized, which loss may be limited under the Code. 
  You may not receive any profits resulting from the sale of one or more of our properties, or receive such profits in a timely manner, because we may provide financing to the purchaser of such property. 
  You may experience a delay before receiving your share of the net proceeds of liquidation. In a liquidation, we may sell our properties either subject to or upon the assumption of any then outstanding mortgage debt or, alternatively, may provide financing to purchasers. We do not have any limitations or restrictions on taking such purchase money obligations, however, we would do so if in the Board's discretion, it was deemed in the best interests of the stockholders. To the extent we receive promissory notes or other property in lieu of cash from sales, such proceeds, other than any interest payable on those proceeds, will not be included in net sale proceeds until and to the extent the promissory notes or other property are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed of. We may receive initial down payments in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments may be spread over a number of years. In such event, you may experience a delay in the distribution of the net proceeds of a sale until such time as the installment payments are received. 
  OTHER RISKS OF THE PROPOSALS 
  Our Board may abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Dissolution. 
  Our Board and stockholders have adopted and approved a Plan of Dissolution for the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. Nevertheless, our Board may terminate the Plan of Dissolution for any reason. This power of termination may be exercised both before and after any approval of the Plan of Dissolution Proposal by our stockholders, up to the time that the Articles of Dissolution have been accepted for record by the SDAT. Notwithstanding approval of the Plan of Dissolution Proposal by our  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents   

stockholders, our Board may modify or amend the Plan of Dissolution without further action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under then current law. Although our Board has no present intention to pursue any alternative to the Plan of Dissolution, our Board may conclude either that its duties under applicable law require it to pursue business opportunities that present themselves or that abandoning the Plan of Dissolution is otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If our Board elects to pursue any alternative to the Plan of Dissolution, our stockholders may not receive any of the consideration currently estimated to be available for distribution to our stockholders pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution. 
  Distributions, if any, to our stockholders could be delayed and our stockholders could, in some circumstances, be held liable for amounts they received from the Company in connection with our dissolution. 
  Although our Board has not established a firm timetable for distributions to our stockholders, our Board intends, subject to contingencies inherent in the winding-up of our business and the payment of our obligations and liabilities, to completely liquidate as soon as practicable after the adoption of the Plan of Dissolution. If we are unable to dispose of all of our assets within 24 months after adoption of the Plan of Dissolution or if it is otherwise advantageous or appropriate to do so, our Board may establish a liquidating trust to which we could distribute in kind its unsold assets. Depending upon the Company s cash flow and cash requirements and the progress of the sale process for our assets under the Plan of Dissolution, we may not make any distributions to our stockholders until we have repaid all of our known retained obligations and liabilities, paid all of our expenses, and complied with the requirements of Maryland law for companies in dissolution, including requirements for the creation and maintenance of adequate contingency reserves as required by Maryland law. Thereafter, we anticipate making distributions to our stockholders as promptly as practicable in accordance with the Plan of Dissolution and the liquidation and dissolution process selected by our Board in its sole discretion. 
  If we fail to create an adequate contingency reserve for payment of its expenses and liabilities, or if we transfer our assets to a liquidating trust and the contingency reserve and the assets held by the liquidating trust are less than the amount ultimately found payable in respect of expenses and liabilities, each of our stockholders could be held liable for the payment to our creditors of such stockholder s pro rata portion of the excess, limited to the amounts previously received by the stockholder in distributions from the Company or the liquidating trust, as applicable. If a court holds at any time that we failed to make adequate provision for its expenses and liabilities or if the amount ultimately required to be paid in respect of such liabilities exceeds the amount available from the contingency reserve and the assets of the liquidating trust, our creditors could seek an injunction to prevent us from making distributions under the Plan of Dissolution on the grounds that the amounts to be distributed are needed to provide for the payment of such expenses and liabilities. Any such action could delay or substantially diminish the cash distributions to be made to our stockholders and/or holders of beneficial interests of any liquidation trust. 
  We will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements. 
  Until our liquidation and dissolution is complete, we have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), even if compliance with these reporting requirements is economically burdensome. In order to curtail expenses, we intend, after filing our Articles of Dissolution, to seek relief from the SEC from the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. We anticipate that, if such relief is granted, we would continue to file current reports on Form 8-K to disclose material events relating to our liquidation and dissolution, along with any other reports that the SEC might require, but would discontinue filing annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. However, the SEC may not grant any such relief. To the extent that we delay filing the Articles of Dissolution, we would be obligated to continue complying with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The expenses we incur in complying with the applicable reporting requirements will reduce the assets available for ultimate distribution to our stockholders. 
  Approval of the Plan of Dissolution may lead to stockholder litigation which could result in substantial costs and distract our management. 
  Historically, extraordinary corporate actions by a company, such as our Plan of Dissolution, sometimes lead to securities class action lawsuits being filed against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation as a result of the Plan of Dissolution. As of the date of this filing, no such lawsuits relative to the Plan of Dissolution were pending or, to our knowledge, threatened. However, if such a lawsuit is filed against us, the litigation is likely to be expensive and, even if we ultimately prevail, the process will divert management s attention from implementing the Plan of Dissolution. If we were not to prevail in such a lawsuit, we may be liable for damages. We cannot predict the amount of any such damages, however, if applicable, they may be significant and may reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

The cash due at Closing on account of the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in this Agreement.  The Purchase Price shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing.  Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree, each acting in good faith, on the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Land, Personal Property and Improvements prior to the Closing.  Such agreed upon allocation shall be used solely for transfer, sales and similar tax purposes and in any declaration or filing with any governmental authority in connection with the same.  The allocation of the Purchase Price for all other purposes, whether for local, state or federal taxes or otherwise, shall not be restricted by this Agreement and shall not require the consent of the other party. 
  2.2        Deposit  . 
  2.2.1        Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit with Republic Title of Texas, Inc., Attention: Jennifer Haden (the    Escrow Agent   ) by bank wire transfer the sum of Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00), as a non-refundable deposit (except as otherwise provided herein) to assure Purchaser s performance hereunder (together with all interest thereon if any, the    Initial Deposit   ).  Prior to making the Initial Deposit, Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement substantially in the form of   Exhibit B   attached hereto (the    Escrow Agreement   ).  So long as Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement as provided in   Section 5.1.4  , then no later than two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the Study Period (as hereinafter defined), Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent by bank wire transfer the additional sum of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the    Second Deposit   ), as a non-refundable deposit (except as otherwise provided herein) to assure Purchaser s performance hereunder.  The Initial Deposit, the Second Deposit, in the total amount of One Million Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($1,500,000), if made, and the Extension Deposit (as defined below), if made, together with all interest thereon, if any, are referred to collectively as the    Deposit  .   The failure of Purchaser to timely make the Second Deposit shall be a breach by Purchaser of this Agreement, in which event Seller shall be entitled to exercise its remedies under   Section 11.2  . 
  2.2.2        Escrow Agent shall place the Initial Deposit, the Second Deposit (if made) and the Extension Deposit (if made) in an interest-bearing escrow account at a federally-insured (to the extent of the FDIC limits) commercial bank acceptable to both Seller and Purchaser.  The Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  At Closing (as hereinafter defined), Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to Seller and credit the Deposit against the Purchase Price.  
  ARTICLE 3          TITLE AND SURVEY 
  3.1        State of Title to be Conveyed  .  Title to the Property shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing in fee simple by Special Warranty Deed, free and clear of any and all liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests and other encumbrances, except for the following (collectively, the    Permitted Exceptions   ):  (i) real property taxes and assessments attributable to the Property for the year in which Closing occurs and thereafter, not yet due and payable; (ii) zoning and other regulatory laws and ordinances affecting the Property; (iii) any easement, right of way, limitation, encroachment, conflict, discrepancy, overlapping of improvements, protrusion, lien, encumbrance, restriction, condition, covenant, exception or other matter with respect to the Property that is reflected or addressed on the Survey or the Title Commitment to which Purchaser fails to timely object pursuant to   Section 3.2.3   or   3.2.4   of this Agreement; (iv) any Purchaser s Objection (as hereinafter defined) that remains uncured, for whatever reason, at the earlier to occur of (A) Closing hereunder or (B) five (5) Business Days after Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller is unwilling or unable to cure or modify Purchaser s Objections to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, and (v) the rights and interests of parties claiming under the Leases.   
  3.2        Title Commitment and Survey  . 
  3.2.1        Seller obtained a title commitment (the    Title Commitment   ) issued by First American Title Insurance Company (the    Title Company   ) for a TLTA owner s policy of title insurance (on the current T-1 Form) in the amount of the Purchase Price with respect to the Property issued by the Title Company and delivered copies of the Title Commitment and all items listed as title exceptions therein (to the extent provided to Seller by the Title Company) to Purchaser on August 23, 2016.  
  3.2.2        Within three (3) Business Days of the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser Seller s latest survey of the Land.  Purchaser may obtain, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense, a new survey or revise, modify, or re-certify an existing survey (the    Survey   ) as necessary in order for the Title Company to amend the survey exception from the Title Policy or to otherwise satisfy Buyer s objectives; provided, however, in no event shall the issuance and/or receipt of such Survey be a condition precedent to, or delay, the Closing.  Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the Survey to Seller and the Title Company within three (3) days after Purchaser s receipt of the Survey. 
  3.2.3        If (i) the Survey shows any easement, right-of-way, encroachment, conflict, protrusion or other matter that is unacceptable to Purchaser, or (ii) any exceptions appear in the Title Commitment that are unacceptable to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days after the later of Purchaser s receipt of the Title Commitment or the Survey, notify Seller in writing of such matters (   Purchaser s Objections   ).  Except for Purchaser s Objections that are timely raised pursuant to the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the form and substance of the Survey, all matters shown thereon, and all exceptions to the Title Commitment and other items shown thereon.  Within five (5) days after Seller s receipt of Purchaser s Objections, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing of the Purchaser s Objections, if any, which Seller elects to attempt to cure at or prior to Closing.  Seller s failure to provide such a notice will be deemed an election by Seller not to cure any Purchaser s Objections. If Seller is unable or unwilling to eliminate or modify all of Purchaser s Objections to the commercially reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, Purchaser may (as its sole and exclusive remedy) terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to Seller by the earlier to occur of (i) 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on the last day of the Study Period (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) five (5) days after Seller s written notice (or deemed notice) to Purchaser of Seller s intent to not cure one or more of such Purchaser s Objections; in which event, the Deposit will be returned to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement (other than any obligations of either party that expressly survive termination).   
  3.2.4        If any revision or update to the Survey or any supplemental title commitment or update issued subsequent to the date of the original Title Commitment discloses any matters not set forth on the original Survey or the original Title Commitment, then, no later than the later of (i) the expiration of the Study Period, or (ii) five (5) days after Purchaser s receipt of the updated Survey, or (iii) five (5) days after Purchaser s receipt of the supplemented or updated Title Commitment, as applicable, Purchaser shall have the right to object to any such matter, in which event the same procedures for response, termination and waiver set forth above shall apply to such new Purchaser s Objections.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such matter not set forth on the original Survey or the original Title Commitment is the result of an intentional act of Seller after the Effective Date that is not otherwise permitted under this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be permitted to pursue the remedies provided in   Section 11.1   hereof. 
  3.2.5        Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no obligation to take any steps, bring any action or proceeding or incur any effort or expense whatsoever to eliminate, modify or cure any objection Purchaser may have pursuant to   Section 3.2.3   or   Section 3.2.4  . 
  ARTICLE 4          PROPERTY INFORMATION 
  4.1        Property Information  .  Prior to the Effective Date, Seller has made available to Purchaser, either at the property management office at the Property or via a due diligence website, certain the materials relating to the Property (collectively, the    Property Information   ).  Purchaser shall keep such Property Information confidential, subject to Purchaser s right to disseminate Property Information to or among the parties listed in   Section 15.17   of this Agreement, and subject to the restrictions set forth in   Section 15.17  .  Seller makes no representation or warranty as to the truth or accuracy of the Property Information provided to Purchaser, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. 
  ARTICLE 5          PURCHASER S DUE DILIGENCE 
  5.1        Purchaser s Due Diligence 
  5.1.1        Subject to the provisions of this Section, Purchaser and its agents, employees, consultants, inspectors, appraisers, engineers and contractors (collectively    Purchaser s Representatives   ) shall have the right, through the Closing Date, from time to time, upon the advance notice required pursuant to this   Section 5.1  , to enter upon and pass through the Property during normal business hours to examine and inspect the same.  Notwithstanding any such inspection, or anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser s obligations hereunder shall not be limited or otherwise affected as a result of any fact, circumstance or other matter of any kind discovered following the date hereof in connection with any such inspection, access or otherwise; it being agreed that Seller is permitting Purchaser such right of inspection and access as a courtesy to Purchaser in its preparation for taking title to the Property.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Purchaser agrees that it shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement or obtain a reduction of the Purchase Price as a result of any such fact, circumstance or other matter so discovered (including, without limitation, relating to the physical condition of the Property, the operations of the Property or otherwise), except as provided in   Section 5.1.4   below and (ii) Purchaser shall have no right to terminate this Agreement or obtain a return of the Deposit except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 
  5.1.2        In conducting any inspection of the Property or otherwise accessing the Property, Purchaser shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of all applicable governmental authorities, and neither Purchaser nor any of Purchaser s Representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of Seller s employees, agents or representatives, or with any tenants (including, without limitation, having any contacts whatsoever with tenants, including but not limited to telephone conversations or electronic mail messages) at, or contractors providing services to, the Property, unless in each case Purchaser obtains the prior written consent of Seller (which may be given via electronic mail), it being agreed that the scope of all such contacts or discussions shall, pending any such approval, be directed to and agreed upon by Brian Tusa via electronic mail (at btusa@trinsicres.com) or Sheri Thomas via electronic mail (at sthomas@trinsicres.com), (ii) interfere with the business of Seller conducted at the Property or disturb the use or occupancy of any tenant or occupant of the Property or (iii)  damage the Property.  In conducting any inspection of the Property or otherwise accessing the Property, Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives shall at all times comply with, and shall be subject to, the rights of the tenants under the Leases (and any persons claiming by, under or through such tenants).  Seller may from time to time establish reasonable rules of conduct for Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives in furtherance of the foregoing, and Purchaser shall comply with all of Seller s requirements regarding entry upon the Property.  Purchaser shall schedule and coordinate all inspections, including, without limitation, any environmental tests, and other access with Seller and shall give Seller at least one (1) Business Day (or in the case of entering occupied units) two (2) Business Days  prior notice thereof.  Seller shall be entitled to have a representative present at all times during each such inspection or other access.  Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller on demand the cost of repairing and restoring any damage or disturbance which Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives shall cause to the Property.  All inspection fees, appraisal fees, engineering fees and other costs and expenses of any kind incurred by Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives relating to such inspection and its other access shall be at the sole expense of Purchaser.  Purchaser shall keep all information obtained during its inspections and access to the Property confidential.  If the Closing shall not occur for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser shall:  (A) upon written request of Seller, promptly deliver to Seller, at no cost to Seller, other that the reasonable cost of the reproduction thereof, and without representation or warranty, the originals of all tests, reports and inspections of the Property, made and conducted by Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives or for Purchaser s benefit that are in the possession or control of Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives except for any studies or reports dealing with market or economic feasibility or other propriety financial information developed by the Purchaser; (B) promptly return to Seller physical copies, if any,  and delete any and all other due diligence materials electronically delivered by Seller to Purchaser; and (C) promptly destroy all copies and abstracts of the materials referenced in (A) and (B) above.  Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives shall not be permitted to conduct borings of the Property or drilling in or on the Property, or any other invasive, intrusive or destructive testing in connection with the preparation of an environmental audit or in connection with any other inspection of the Property without the prior written consent of Seller, which Seller may give or withhold in its sole discretion (and, if such consent is given, Purchaser shall be obligated to pay to Seller on demand the cost of repairing and restoring any damage as aforesaid).  This   Section 5.1.2   shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement. 
  5.1.3        Prior to conducting any physical inspection or testing at the Property, Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives shall obtain, and during the period of such inspection or testing shall maintain, at their expense: (i) commercial general liability (   CGL   ) insurance, issued on a form at least as broad as Insurance Services Office (   ISO   ) Commercial General Liability Coverage  occurrence  form CG 00 01 10 01 or another  occurrence  form providing equivalent coverage, including contractual liability and personal injury liability coverage, with limits of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for any one occurrence and Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate; (ii) comprehensive automobile liability insurance (covering any automobiles owned or operated by Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives) issued on a form at least as broad as ISO Business Auto Coverage form CA 00 01 07 97 or other form providing equivalent coverage; (iii) worker s compensation insurance or participation in a monopolistic state workers  compensation fund, and (iv) employer s liability insurance or (in a monopolistic state) Stop Gap Liability insurance.  Such automobile liability insurance shall be in an amount not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for each accident.  Such worker s compensation insurance shall carry minimum limits as defined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located (as the same may be amended from time to time).  Such employer s liability insurance shall be in an amount not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for each accident, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) disease-policy limit, and One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) disease-each employee.  Seller, and its property manager, shall be covered as additional insureds on the CGL and automobile liability insurance policies with respect to liability arising out of the named insured s acts or omissions relating to the Property.  The insurer and the terms and conditions of all the foregoing policies shall be acceptable to Seller.  Prior to making any entry upon the Property, Purchaser shall furnish to Seller a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing coverages, which certificate of insurance shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Seller.  
  5.1.4        Purchaser shall have until 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on September 21, 2016 (the    Study Period   ) within which to determine, in its sole discretion, whether all matters related to the Property are satisfactory to Purchaser.  If Purchaser, in its sole discretion, determines that the purchase of the Property is not feasible and that Purchaser does not desire to proceed with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, then Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, prior to the expiration of the Study Period, written notice that Purchaser does not desire to proceed with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and in such case, this Agreement shall terminate upon Seller s receipt of such notice, except for those matters which are indicated herein as surviving termination, and the Deposit shall be immediately returned to Purchaser.  If Purchaser fails to timely notify Seller prior to the expiration of the Study Period (with time being of the essence) that Purchaser does not desire to proceed with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement as aforesaid, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement under this   Section 5.1.4  . 
  5.1.5        Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller, its partners, members, affiliates, property manager, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, and representatives (collectively, the    Indemnified Parties   ) from and against any and all liens, claims, or damages of any kind or nature, including any demands, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, interest and penalties, and reasonable attorneys  fees suffered, incurred, or sustained by any of the Indemnified Parties directly caused by Purchaser or Purchaser s Representatives with respect to any due-diligence activities at the Property pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,    Losses   ), except any arising from the discovery of preexisting conditions (so long as Purchaser does not exacerbate any such condition),   including Losses caused by the negligence (but not the gross negligence or willful misconduct) of the Indemnified Parties  .  This   Section 5.1.5   shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

As used herein, a  material adverse effect  shall be deemed to have occurred if by reason of such misrepresentation or breach of covenant the fair market value of the Property is decreased by an amount exceeding $300,000.  For purposes hereof, a representation or warranty shall not be deemed to have been breached if the representation or warranty is not true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date by reason of changed facts or circumstances which (i) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are permitted to have occurred or (ii) are not within the reasonable control of Seller.

  9.3.3        Costs  .  Purchaser will pay all costs allocated to Purchaser pursuant to   Section 9.5   of this Agreement. 
  9.4        Escrow  .  The delivery of the documents and the payment of the sums to be delivered and paid at the Closing shall be accomplished through an escrow with the Escrow Agent.   
  9.5        Costs and Adjustments at Closing  . 
  9.5.1        Expenses  .  Seller shall pay (a) the fees of any counsel representing Seller in connection with this transaction, (b) one-half (1/2) of the escrow fee charged by Escrow Agent, and (c) the premium for standard TLTA coverage owner s policy of title insurance.  Purchaser shall pay (i) the fees of any counsel representing Purchaser in connection with this transaction, (ii) the documentary stamps on the Deed, if any, (iii) recording costs for the recordation of the Deed conveying the Property to Purchaser; (iii) costs and expenses related to the Survey, (iv) the costs and expenses related to all of Purchaser s due diligence studies and investigations, (v) one-half (1/2) of the escrow fee charged by Escrow Agent, (vi) all costs related to Purchaser s financing of the Property (including, but not limited to, documentary stamp taxes, if any, and non-recurring intangible taxes in connection therewith), if applicable, and (vii) all charges and costs relating to the costs of the Title Policy attributable to any endorsements desired by Purchaser, including those for any title examinations, title commitments or premiums.  Any other costs or expenses incident to this transaction and the closing thereof not expressly provided for above shall be allocated between and paid by the parties in accordance with custom and practice in Fort Bend County, Texas. 
  9.5.2        Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes  .  Real estate, personal property and ad valorem taxes for the year in which the Closing occurs will be prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of the Apportionment Time (as hereinafter defined) on the basis of actual bills therefor, if available.  If such bills are not available, then such taxes and other charges shall be prorated on the basis of the most currently available tax bills.  Any and all rebates or reductions in taxes received subsequent to Closing for the calendar year in which Closing occurs, net of costs of obtaining the same (including without limitation reasonable attorneys  fees) and net of any amounts due to tenants, shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time, when received.  The current installment of all special assessments, if any, which are a lien against the Property at the time of Closing and which are being or may be paid in installments shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time.  As used herein, the term    Apportionment Time    shall mean 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date. 
  9.5.3        Lease Security Deposits  .  At Closing, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, as a credit against the Purchase Price, an amount equal to all refundable security deposits required to be held by Seller under the Leases (together with accrued interest thereon required by law or by the terms of the Leases), and thereafter Purchaser shall be solely obligated for the return of such security deposits and other deposits.  Nonrefundable deposits, fees and upfront payments and prepaid amounts under laundry, telecommunications and other similar leases and concessions, will not be prorated, nor will Purchaser be entitled to a credit on account of such amounts. 
  9.5.4        Rents  .  All rents and other costs or charges paid by tenants under the Leases shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time, to the extent actually collected by Seller.  With respect to any rent or charges that are delinquent prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right to pursue all rights and remedies against the tenants to recover such delinquencies; provided, however, that Seller shall not be entitled to dispossess such tenants.  Purchaser shall promptly remit to Seller any rent or payments for any charges received by Purchaser subsequent to Closing which are attributable to periods prior to Closing; provided, however, that such amounts received from tenants after Closing will first be applied to such charges as are then due and then applied in their reverse order of accrual until applied in full. From and after Closing and for a period of sixty (60) days thereafter, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect from the tenants all rents that are delinquent for the period prior to Closing.   
  9.5.5        Utilities  .  Water, sewer, electric, fuel (if any) and other utility charges, other than those for which tenants under Leases are responsible directly to the provider, shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time.  If consumption of any of the foregoing is measured by meter, Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date, endeavor to obtain a reading of each such meter and a final bill as of the Closing Date.  If there is no such meter or if the bill for any of the foregoing shall have not been issued as of the Closing Date, the charges therefor shall be adjusted as of the Apportionment Time on the basis of the charges of the prior period for which such bills were issued and shall be further adjusted between the parties when the bills for the correct period are issued.  Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to cause the transfer of utility accounts from Seller to Purchaser.  Seller shall be entitled to retain any utility security deposits to be refunded.  At Closing, Purchaser shall post substitute utility security deposits to replace those previously paid by Seller or, if the utility provider will not refund such deposits to Seller, Seller shall be reimbursed therefor by Purchaser at Closing. 
  9.5.6        Contracts  .  All payments made or required under Contracts assumed by Purchaser shall be adjusted and apportioned as of the Apportionment Time. 
  9.5.7        Insurance Policies  .  Premiums on insurance policies will not be adjusted.  As of the Closing Date, Seller will terminate its insurance coverage and Purchaser will obtain its own insurance coverage.  
  9.5.8        Closing Statement  .  Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller or its agents or designees shall prepare, and promptly thereafter, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly agree upon, a closing statement (the    Closing Statement   ) that will show the net amount due either to Seller or to Purchaser as the result of the adjustments and prorations provided for in this Agreement, and such net due amount shall be added to or subtracted from the cash balance of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller at the Closing, as applicable.  Not later than the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall reprorate the adjustments and prorations provided for herein respecting any items that were not capable of being determined as of the Closing Date or that previously were incorrectly or inaccurately determined and need to be corrected and the manner in which such items shall be determined and paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The net amount due Seller or Purchaser, if any, by reason of adjustments to the Closing Statement shall be paid in cash by the party obligated therefor within five (5) Business Days following the reproration by Seller and Purchaser.  The reproration agreed to by Seller and Purchaser not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto except for any items that are not capable of being determined at the time such reproration has been made by Seller and Purchaser and shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto except for any items that are not capable of being determined at that time of reproration, which items shall be determined and paid promptly as soon as they are capable of being determined.  Prior to and following the Closing Date, each party shall provide the other with such information as the other shall reasonably request (including, without limitation, access to the books, records, files, ledgers, information and data with respect to the Property during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice) in order to make the preliminary and final adjustments and prorations provided for herein. 
  9.5.9        Survival  .  The provisions of this   Section 9.5   shall survive Closing. 
  ARTICLE 10          DAMAGE AND CONDEMNATION 
  10.1        Damage  .  If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the Property is damaged by fire or any other cause whatsoever, Seller shall promptly give Purchaser written notice of such damage.   
  10.1.1        Minor Damage  .  If the cost for repairing such damage is less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) (as determined by Seller s independent insurer providing coverage as of the time of such loss), then Purchaser shall have the right at Closing to receive the amount of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds received by Seller as a result of such loss, or an assignment of Seller s rights to such insurance proceeds, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with no reduction in the Purchase Price, and Seller shall have no further liability or obligation to repair such damage or to replace the Property.   
  10.1.2        Major Damage  .  If the cost for repairing such damage exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) (as determined by Seller s independent insurer providing coverage as of the time of such loss), then Purchaser shall have the option, exercisable by written notice delivered to Seller within ten (10) Business Days after Seller s notice of damage to Purchaser (with Closing being extended to accommodate the Purchaser s notice hereunder) either (i) to receive the amount of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds received (or to be received) by Seller as a result of such loss, or an assignment of Seller s rights to such insurance proceeds, including the right to negotiate the claim with the Seller s insurer, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with no reduction in the Purchase Price, and Seller shall have no further liability or obligation to repair such damage or to replace the Property; or (ii) to terminate this Agreement.  If Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement, Purchaser shall give notice to Seller thereof, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and thereafter neither party will have any further rights or obligations hereunder, except for any obligations that expressly survive termination.  If Purchaser fails to notify Seller within such five (5) Business Day period (or such shorter period so as to permit Closing to occur not later than the Closing Date, time being strictly of the essence) of Purchaser s election to terminate this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected option (i), and Purchaser and Seller shall proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   
  10.2        Condemnation and Eminent Domain  .  If, prior to Closing, all or a material part of the Property is taken by eminent domain or any proceedings for the taking by eminent domain of all or a material part of the Property is commenced, Seller shall immediately notify Purchaser of the same and Purchaser, at its option within five (5) days after receiving notice thereof from Seller, may terminate its obligation to complete the transfer of the Property in which case the Deposit will be returned to Purchaser.  If Purchaser elects to complete the transfer of the Property notwithstanding a taking by eminent domain or proceeding therefore or deed in lieu thereof, Seller will deliver to Purchaser at Closing, through the closing escrow, all condemnation proceeds previously received by Seller and an assignment of Seller s rights with respect to all uncollected condemnation proceeds (in either case, net of proceeds allocable to loss of use of the Property for the period through the Closing Date and costs incurred by Seller in connection with such proceedings) and such documents as Purchaser may reasonably request to substitute itself for Seller in any pending eminent domain proceedings.   
  10.3        Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act Not Applicable  .  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of   Sections 10.1   and   10.2   hereinabove govern the rights of the parties in the event of damage to or condemnation of the Property, and that the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (Section 5.007 of the Texas Property Code) not apply to this Agreement. 
  ARTICLE 11          REMEDIES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS 
  11.1        Seller Default At or Before Closing  .  If Seller is in breach or default of any of its obligations or agreements hereunder when performance is required on or prior to the Closing Date, or if any of the representations contained in   Section 6.1   should be false in any material respect (subject to the provisions of   Section 8.4  ) and Purchaser shall become actually aware of same on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall not have waived its claims with regard to same pursuant to this Agreement, then Purchaser shall give Seller written notice of such breach or default on or prior to the Closing Date and Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default and the Closing Date shall be extended accordingly.  If Seller fails to cure such breach or default within such ten (10) Business Day period, then Purchaser shall have the right, at its sole option and as its sole remedy, and Purchaser hereby waives its right to pursue any other remedy at law or in equity, and as Purchaser s sole and exclusive remedy, Purchaser shall either (i) to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and the Escrow Agent, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, whereupon neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations hereunder other than the obligations and rights set forth herein that expressly survive the termination of this Agreement, or (ii) with respect to the failure to convey the Property, as required hereunder, to pursue specific performance of such obligation of Seller.  As a condition precedent to Purchaser s exercising any right it may have to bring an action for specific performance hereunder, Purchaser must commence such action for specific performance within thirty (30) days after the scheduled Closing Date.  Purchaser agrees that its failure to timely commence such an action for specific performance within such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed a waiver by it of its right to commence an action for specific performance as well as a waiver by it of any right it may have to file or record a notice of lis pendens or notice of pendency of action or similar notice against the Property.  In no event shall Purchaser seek, or Seller be liable for, any damages to Purchaser, including, without limitation, punitive or consequential damages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and only if specific performance is unavailable as a remedy to Buyer due to the sale of the Property to a third party during the term of this Agreement, then Buyer shall be entitled to seek all actual, but not punitive or consequential, damages incurred by Buyer by reason of Seller s action.   
  11.2        Seller Default From and After Closing  .  Subject to the limitations set forth in   Section 6.4   of this Agreement, if Seller is in breach or default of any of its obligations or agreements hereunder that survive the Closing when performance is required, including, without limitation, any obligations or agreements under the documents delivered at Closing by Seller pursuant to   Section 9.2.1   of this Agreement, or if any of the Express Representations should be false in any material respect and Purchaser shall first become actually aware of same after the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall give Seller written notice of such breach or default of such obligation, agreement or representation hereunder prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period of such breach or default and Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default.  If Seller fails to cure such breach or default within such thirty (30) day period, and the reasonably estimated losses or damages sustained as a result of Seller s failure or inability to perform any of its obligations, agreements or Express Representations hereunder exceed Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00), then Seller shall be liable for the actual direct damages suffered by Purchaser due to such uncured breach or default from the first dollar of loss.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for damages in an aggregate amount in excess of Four Hundred Eleven Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($411,750.00), (ii) Seller s inability to satisfy a condition of this Agreement shall not be considered a default by Seller hereunder unless such inability results from the breach of any of Seller s representations set forth in   Section 6.1   or the breach of Seller s express covenants and obligations hereunder, and (iii) if Purchaser has actual knowledge of a default by Seller on the Closing Date and Purchaser elects to close the transaction contemplated herein, Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such default and Seller shall not have any liability with respect to such default. 
  11.3        Purchaser Default  .  The parties acknowledge and agree that Seller should be entitled to compensation for any detriment suffered if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property if and when required to do so under the terms of this Agreement, but agree that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the extent of the actual detriment Seller would suffer as a result of such failure.  Consequently, if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property on the Closing Date or fails to perform any of its other covenants in any material respect, or otherwise defaults in its obligations hereunder, then Seller shall be entitled, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to Purchaser prior to or at the Closing and, except with respect to breach or default of Purchaser under   Sections 2.2.1   or   9.3  , Purchaser shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default and the Closing Date shall be extended accordingly, in which event the Deposit shall be paid to Seller as fixed, agreed and liquidated damages, and, after the payment of the Deposit to Seller, neither Seller nor Purchaser will have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement, except for any obligations that expressly survive termination, except that Seller shall have the right to pursue an action against Purchaser for Seller s actual damages suffered on account of a default by Purchaser under   Sections 5.1.2  ,   6.2  ,   12.2   and   15.17   of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver by Seller of any damages, rights or remedies which may be available to Seller against Purchaser at law or in equity as a result of any material breach of a representation or warranty or other material default of Purchaser hereunder for matters which, by the terms of this Agreement expressly survive the Closing or earlier termination hereof (other than Purchaser s failure to consummate the purchase of the Property on the Closing Date or failure to timely make the Second Deposit, for each of which Seller shall be paid the Deposit in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence as full, final agreed upon liquidated damages), all of which are hereby expressly reserved by Seller; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall entitle Seller to consequential or punitive damages or any other sums in excess of Seller s actual damages. 
  11.4        Delivery of Materials  .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, then Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller all Property Information provided to Purchaser by Seller, including copies thereof in any form whatsoever, including electronic form, along with, upon Seller s prior written request, any and all tests results and studies of the Property performed by or on behalf of Purchaser pursuant to   Article 5  , excluding any confidential or proprietary information or financial modeling.  The obligations of Purchaser under this   Section 11.4   shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 
  ARTICLE 12          BROKERAGE COMMISSION 
  12.1        Brokers  .  Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that Seller has not contacted or entered into any agreement with any real estate broker, agent, finder, or any party in connection with this transaction, except for Moran   Company (   Seller s Broker   ) and that Seller has not taken any action which would result in any real estate broker s or finder s fees or commissions being due and payable to any party other than Seller s Broker with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby.  Seller will be solely responsible for the payment of Seller s Broker s commission in accordance with the provisions of a separate agreement.  Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller that Purchaser has not contracted or entered into any agreement with any real estate broker, agent, finder, or any party in connection with this transaction and that Purchaser has not taken any action which would result in any real estate broker s or finder s fees or commissions being due or payable to any party with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby.  Seller acknowledges that Purchaser has disclosed to the Seller that Martin Pechter, a principal of the Buyer, is a licensed broker in Florida and Pennsylvania, but is acting solely as a principal in this transaction.  Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller that Martin Pechter shall not be entitled to any brokerage fee or commission arising out of this transaction. 
  12.2        Indemnity  .  Each party hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold the other party harmless from and against any loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) paid or incurred by the other party by reason of a breach of the representation and warranty made by such party under this   Article 12  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the indemnities set forth in this   Section 12.2   shall survive the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement.   
  ARTICLE 13          NOTICES 
  13.1        Written Notice  .  All notices, demands and requests which may be given or which are required to be given by either party to the other party under this Agreement must be in writing. 
  13.2        Method of Transmittal  .  All notices, demands, requests or other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder must be sent (i) by United States certified mail, postage fully prepaid, return receipt requested, (ii) by hand delivery, (iii) by FedEx or a similar nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (iv) by facsimile, with written confirmation by recognized overnight carrier service, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered upon receipt of confirmation transmission of such facsimile notice.  All such notices, demands, requests or other communications shall be deemed to have been given for all purposes of this Agreement upon the date of receipt or refusal, except that whenever under this Agreement a notice is either received on a day which is not a Business Day or is required to be delivered on or before a specific day which is not a Business Day, the day of receipt or required delivery shall automatically be extended to the next Business Day. 
  13.3        Addresses  .  The addresses for proper notice under this Agreement are as follows: 

Either party may from time to time by written notice to the other party designate a different address for notices.  Notices sent to or from an address outside of the continental United States shall be sent only by one of the methods specified in clauses (ii) or (iii) of this   Section 13.3  .  Anything contained in this   Section 13.3   to the contrary notwithstanding, all notices may be executed and sent by the parties  counsel. 
    
  ARTICLE 14          ASSIGNMENT 
  Neither party shall have the right to assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the party whose consent has been requested.  Seller hereby consents to an assignment at Closing by Purchaser of its interest in this Agreement to an affiliate of Purchaser without further evidence of such subsidiary s financial capability to consummate Closing hereunder, provided that such subsidiary shall assume, in writing (by execution of an assignment and assumption agreement reasonably satisfactory to Seller), all of Purchaser s obligations under this Agreement.

If not previously delivered to Purchaser, Seller will deliver to Purchaser a copy of the Seller s existing title policy within three (3) days after the Effective Date. 
  3.2.2        Purchaser shall obtain, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense, a survey of the Property (certified to include Seller) prepared by a licensed surveyor (the    Survey   )  after the Effective Date, which Survey may be an update of any existing survey of the Property and deliver a copy of same to Seller.

  3.2.5        Seller shall have no obligation to remove or cure Purchaser s Objections, except Seller does agree to remove or cure (i) liens of an ascertainable amount placed on or caused to be placed on the Property by Seller or Seller s affiliates, (ii) any encumbrances to title which are created by Seller after the Effective Date without Purchaser s consent, and (iii) any matters objected to by Purchaser which Seller has agreed to cure; and Purchaser shall have its rights and remedies described in   Section 11.1   if Seller does not so remove or cure the matters described in items (i), (ii) and (iii) of this sentence.

Notwithstanding any such inspection, or anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser's obligations hereunder shall not be limited or otherwise affected as a result of any fact, circumstance or other matter of any kind discovered following the date hereof in connection with any such inspection, access or otherwise; it being agreed that Seller is permitting Purchaser such right of inspection and access as a courtesy to Purchaser in its preparation for taking title to the Property.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Purchaser agrees that it shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement or obtain a reduction of the Purchase Price as a result of any such fact, circumstance or other matter so discovered (including, without limitation, relating to the physical condition of the Property, the operations of the Property or otherwise), except as provided in   Section 5.1.4   below and (ii) Purchaser shall have no right to terminate this Agreement or obtain a return of the Deposit except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

In conducting any inspection of the Property or otherwise accessing the Property, Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives shall at all times comply with, and shall be subject to, the rights of the tenants under the Leases (and any persons claiming by, under or through such tenants).  Seller may from time to time establish reasonable rules of conduct for Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives in furtherance of the foregoing, and Purchaser shall comply with all of Seller s requirements regarding entry upon the Property.  Purchaser shall schedule and coordinate all inspections, including, without limitation, any environmental tests, and other access with Seller and shall give Seller reasonable advance notice (at least 24 hours  electronic notice shall be deemed reasonable) of any such entry upon the Property.  Purchaser shall coordinate with Seller prior to conducting any Property management or leasing staff interviews.  Seller shall be entitled to have a representative present at all times during each such inspection, interview or other access unless Seller has, following receipt of Purchaser s notice of its intent to enter the Property, elected to not provide any such representative.  Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller on demand the cost of repairing and restoring any damage or disturbance which Purchaser or Purchaser's Representatives shall cause to the Property.  All inspection fees, appraisal fees, engineering fees and other costs and expenses of any kind incurred by Purchaser or Purchaser's Representatives relating to such inspection and its other access shall be at the sole expense of Purchaser. Subject to the terms of   Section 15.17  , Purchaser shall keep all information obtained during its inspections and access to the Property confidential.  If the Closing shall not occur for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser shall: (A) promptly return to Seller copies of all Property Information delivered by Seller to Purchaser; and (B) promptly destroy all copies and abstracts of the materials referenced in (A) and, subject to applicable law, all materials obtained by Purchaser pursuant to its investigations of the Property.  Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives shall not be permitted to conduct borings of the Property or drilling in or on the Property, or any other invasive, intrusive or destructive testing in connection with the preparation of an environmental audit or in connection with any other inspection of the Property without the prior written consent of Seller, which Seller may give or withhold in its sole discretion (and, if such consent is given, Purchaser shall be obligated to pay to Seller on demand the cost of repairing and restoring any damage as aforesaid); provided that Purchaser shall be entitled to perform any Phase I environmental assessments of the Property and any applicable radon testing without Seller s consent.  This   Section 5.1.2   shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement. 
  5.1.3        Prior to conducting any physical inspection or testing at the Property, Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives shall obtain, and during the period of such inspection  
  
    7

  9.5.2        Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes  .  Real estate, personal property and ad valorem taxes for the year in which the Closing occurs will be prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of the Apportionment Time (as hereinafter defined) on the basis of actual bills therefor (using the highest available discounted rate), if available.  If such bills are not available, then such taxes and other charges shall be prorated on the basis of the most currently available tax bills and, thereafter, promptly re-prorated upon the availability of actual bills for the applicable period.  Any and all rebates or reductions in taxes received subsequent to Closing for the calendar year in which Closing occurs, net of costs of obtaining the same (including without limitation reasonable attorneys  fees) and net of any amounts due to tenants, shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time, when received.  The current installment of all special assessments, if any, which are a lien against the Property at the time of Closing and which are being or may be paid in installments shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time.  As used herein, the term    Apportionment Time    shall mean 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date. 
  9.5.3        Lease Security Deposits  .  At Closing, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, as a credit against the Purchase Price, an amount equal to all security deposits and other deposits held by Seller under the Leases (together with accrued interest thereon required by law or by the terms of the Leases), and thereafter Purchaser shall be solely obligated for the return of such security deposits and other deposits. 
  9.5.4        Rents  .  All rents and other costs or charges paid by tenants under the Leases shall be prorated as of the Apportionment Time, to the extent actually collected by Seller.  Rents delinquent as of the Closing Date will not be prorated. If Seller collects any unpaid or delinquent rent or reimbursements for the Property, Seller shall, within fifteen (15) days after the receipt  
  
    24 
  615220 

thereof, deliver to Purchaser any such rent or reimbursement which Purchaser is entitled to hereunder relating to the date of Closing and any period thereafter.  Rents collected within 90 days after the Closing by Purchaser must be applied first against rents attributable to the period after the Closing, until all of such rents have been collected, and then to rents attributable to the period before the Closing.  Purchaser will remit to Seller any rents collected by Purchaser within 90 days after Closing that, in accordance with this   Section 9.5.4  , are allocable to the period before the Closing.  Seller and Purchaser agree that all rent and reimbursements received by Seller or Purchaser after the Closing shall be applied first to current rentals and reimbursements and then to delinquent rentals and reimbursements, if any, in inverse order of maturity (i.e. any such collected rent shall be allocated to the most recent delinquent period first), and that any rent or reimbursements received by Purchaser more than ninety (90) days after Closing shall belong to Purchaser.  Purchaser will make a good faith effort after Closing to collect all rents and reimbursements in the usual course of Purchaser s operation of the Property, but Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or other collection procedures to collect delinquent rents or reimbursements, nor shall Seller have any right to bring an action against or otherwise attempt to collect any delinquent amounts from existing tenants of the Property. 
  9.5.5        Utilities  .  Water, sewer, electric, fuel (if any) and other utility charges, other than those for which tenants under Leases are responsible directly to the provider, shall be accounted for as provided in this   Section 9.5.5   as of the Apportionment Time.  If consumption of any of the foregoing is measured by meter, Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date, endeavor to obtain a reading of each such meter and a final bill as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall establish new accounts with the utilities, all on a basis so as to avoid any interruption in utilities to the Property.  Seller shall be entitled to retain any utility security deposits to be refunded.  At Closing, Purchaser shall post substitute utility security deposits to replace those previously paid by Seller or, if the utility provider will not refund such deposits to Seller, Seller shall be reimbursed therefor by Purchaser at Closing.  Only if there is no such meter or if the bill for any of the foregoing shall have not been issued as of the Closing Date, the charges therefor shall be adjusted as of the Apportionment Time on the basis of the charges for the prior period for which such bills were issued and shall be further adjusted between the parties when the bills for the current period are issued.   
  9.5.6        Contracts  .  All payments made or required under Contracts assumed by Purchaser shall be adjusted and apportioned as of the Apportionment Time.  
  9.5.7        Insurance Policies  .  Premiums on insurance policies will not be adjusted.  As of the Closing Date, Seller will terminate its insurance coverage and Purchaser will obtain its own insurance coverage. 
  
    25 
  615220 

9.5.8        Closing Statement  .  Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller or its agents or designees shall prepare, and promptly thereafter, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly agree upon, a closing statement (the    Closing Statement   ) that will show the net amount due either to Seller or to Purchaser as the result of the adjustments and prorations provided for in this Agreement, and such net due amount shall be added to or subtracted from the cash balance of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller at the Closing, as applicable.  Not later than the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly prepare a final closing statement reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser in form and substance (the    Final Closing Statement   ) setting forth the final determination of the adjustments and prorations provided for herein and setting forth any items that are not capable of being determined at such time (and the manner in which such items shall be determined and paid).  The net amount due Seller or Purchaser, if any, by reason of adjustments to the Closing Statement as shown in the Final Closing Statement, shall be paid in cash by the party obligated therefor within five (5) Business Days following that party's receipt of the approved Final Closing Statement.  The adjustments, prorations and determinations agreed to by Seller and Purchaser in the Final Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto except for any items that are not capable of being determined at the time the Final Closing Statement as agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, which items shall be determined and paid promptly as soon as they are capable of being determined and except for other amounts payable hereunder pursuant to provisions which survive the Closing.  Prior to and following the Closing Date, each party shall provide the other with such information as the other shall reasonably request (including, without limitation, access to the books, records, files, ledgers, information and data with respect to the Property during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice) in order to make the preliminary and final adjustments and prorations provided for herein. 
  9.5.9        Survival  .  The provisions of this   Section 9.5   shall survive Closing. 
    
           ARTICLE 10   
    DAMAGE AND CONDEMNATION 
       
  10.1        Damage  .  If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the Property is damaged by fire or any other cause whatsoever, Seller shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) days thereafter) give Purchaser written notice of such damage.   
  10.1.1        Minor Damage  .  If the cost for repairing such damage is less than One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000.00)     (as determined by Seller s independent insurer), then Purchaser shall have the right at Closing to receive the amount of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds received by Seller as a result of such loss, or an assignment of Seller s rights to such insurance proceeds, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and  
  
    26 
  615220 

effect with no reduction in the Purchase Price, and Seller shall have no further liability or obligation to repair such damage or to replace the Property; provided, however, if any such repairs are necessary to avoid further damage to the Property or for the protection of life and/or property, Seller shall promptly undertake such repairs. 
  10.1.2        Major Damage  .  If the cost for repairing such damage exceeds One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000.00) (as determined by Seller s independent insurer), then Purchaser shall have the option, exercisable by written notice delivered to Seller within five (5) Business Days after Seller s notice of damage to Purchaser, either (i) to receive the amount of the deductible plus all insurance proceeds received by Seller as a result of such loss, or an assignment of Seller s rights to such insurance proceeds, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with no reduction in the Purchase Price (and the Closing Date shall be extended on a day per day basis as necessary to take into account such notice and response periods), and Seller shall have no further liability or obligation to repair such damage or to replace the Property provided, however, if any such repairs are necessary to avoid further damage to the Property or for the protection of life and/or property, Seller shall promptly undertake such repairs; or (ii) to terminate this Agreement.  If Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement, Purchaser shall give notice to Seller thereof, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and thereafter neither party will have any further rights or obligations hereunder, except for any obligations that expressly survive termination.  If Purchaser fails to notify Seller within such five (5) Business Day period of Purchaser s election to terminate this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected option (i), and Purchaser and Seller shall proceed to Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and the Closing Date shall be extended on a day per day basis as required to take into account such notice and response periods).   
  10.2        Condemnation and Eminent Domain  .  If, prior to Closing, all or any part of the Property is taken by eminent domain or any proceedings for the taking by eminent domain of all or any part of the Property is commenced or Seller and the condemning authority enter into discussions regarding Seller's delivery of a deed in lieu thereof, then Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days), provide Purchaser with written notice thereof and Purchaser, at its option within five (5) Business Days after receiving notice thereof from Seller, may terminate its obligation to complete the transfer of the Property in which case the Deposit will be returned to Purchaser.  If Purchaser elects to complete the transfer of the Property notwithstanding a taking by eminent domain or proceeding therefore or deed in lieu thereof, Purchaser shall pay the entire Purchase Price, without setoff or reduction, and Seller will deliver to Purchaser at Closing, through the closing escrow, all condemnation proceeds previously received by Seller and an assignment of Seller's rights with respect to all uncollected condemnation proceeds (in either case, net of proceeds allocable to loss of use of the Property for the period through the Closing Date and reasonable costs incurred by Seller in connection with such proceedings) and such documents as Purchaser may reasonably request to substitute itself for Seller in any pending eminent domain  
  
    27 
  615220 

proceedings. In any such event the Closing Date shall be extended on a day per day basis as required to take into account such notice and response periods. 
           ARTICLE 11   
    REMEDIES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS 
       
  11.1        Seller Default At or Before Closing  .  If Seller is in breach or default of any of its obligations or agreements hereunder when performance is required on or prior to the Closing Date, or if any of the representations contained in   Section 6.1   should be false in any material respect (subject to the provisions of   Section 8.4  ) and Purchaser shall become actually aware of same on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall not have waived its claims with regard to same pursuant to this Agreement, then Purchaser shall give Seller written notice of such breach or default on or prior to the Closing Date and Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default and the Closing Date shall be extended accordingly.  If Seller fails to cure such breach or default within such ten (10) Business Day period, then Purchaser     shall have the right, at its sole option and as its sole remedy, and Purchaser hereby waives its right to pursue any other remedy at law or in equity, and as Purchaser s sole and exclusive remedy, to either (i) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and the Escrow Agent, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive from Seller (and to bring an action against Seller if Seller fails to comply) for reimbursement of Purchaser's direct third party out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys  fees, and the inspection, acquisition and financing of the Property, including, without limitation, any forfeited good faith and/or rate lock deposits, in a maximum amount not to exceed an aggregate of One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00), whereupon neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations hereunder other than the obligations and rights set forth herein that expressly survive the termination of this Agreement, or (ii) pursue specific performance of the obligations of Seller hereunder.  As a condition precedent to Purchaser s exercising any right it may have to bring an action for specific performance hereunder, Purchaser must commence such action for specific performance within thirty (30) days after the scheduled Closing Date.  Purchaser agrees that its failure to timely commence such an action for specific performance within such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed a waiver by it of its right to commence an action for specific performance as well as a waiver by it of any right it may have to file or record a notice of   lis pendens   or notice of pendency of action or similar notice against the Property.  The foregoing notwithstanding, if the Purchaser elects to undertake an action for specific performance and such action is barred or otherwise unavailable as a result of the wrongful or intentional bad acts of Seller, including, but not limited to, the conveyance of title to the Property to a party other than Purchaser after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover its actual damages in connection with such default; provided, however, in any such case the maximum recovery that Purchaser may receive will be capped at $760,000. Except as specifically set forth above, in no event shall Purchaser seek, or Seller be liable for, any damages to Purchaser, including,  
  
    28 
  615220 

without limitation, punitive or consequential damages; except that Purchaser shall have the right to pursue an action against Seller for Purchaser s actual damages suffered on account of a default by Seller under   Section     12.2   of this Agreement.   The foregoing part of this   Section 11.1   to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller shall not be entitled to any notice and right to cure with respect to those matters to be performed by Seller on the Closing Date and as a part of the Closing. 
  11.2        Seller Default From and After Closing  .  Subject to the limitations set forth in   Section 6.4   of this Agreement, if Seller is in breach or default of any of its obligations or agreements hereunder that survive the Closing when performance is required, including, without limitation, any obligations or agreements under the documents delivered at Closing by Seller pursuant to   Section 9.2.1   of this Agreement, or if any of the Express Representations should be false in any material respect and Purchaser shall first become actually aware of same after the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall give Seller written notice of such breach or default of such obligation, agreement or representation hereunder prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period of such breach or default and Seller shall, to the extent the same is curable, have fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default.  If Seller fails to cure such breach or default within such fifteen (15) day period, and the reasonably estimated losses or damages sustained as a result of Seller s failure or inability to perform any of its obligations, agreements or Express Representations hereunder exceed Twenty Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00  )   (the    Floor   ), then Seller shall be liable for the actual direct damages suffered by Purchaser due to such uncured breach or default from the first dollar of loss.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for damages in an aggregate amount in excess of Seven Hundred Sixty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($760,000.00), (ii) Seller s inability to satisfy a condition of this Agreement shall not be considered a default by Seller hereunder unless such inability results from the breach of any of Seller s representations set forth in   Section 6.1   or the breach of Seller s express covenants and obligations hereunder, and (iii) if Purchaser has knowledge of a default by Seller on the Closing Date and Purchaser elects to close the transaction contemplated herein, Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such default and Seller shall not have any liability with respect to such default.     
  11.3        Purchaser Default  .  The parties acknowledge and agree that Seller should be entitled to compensation for any detriment suffered if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property if and when required to do so under the terms of this Agreement, but agree that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the extent of the actual detriment Seller would suffer as a result of such failure.  Consequently, if Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property on the Closing Date or fails to perform any of its other covenants in any material respect, or otherwise defaults in its obligations hereunder, then Seller shall give Purchaser written notice of such breach or default on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure such breach or default and the Closing Date shall be extended accordingly.  If Purchaser fails to cure such breach or default within such ten (10) Business Day  
  
    29

    36

Property Information and any information obtained by Purchaser in connection with its investigations of the Property (i) to Purchaser's architects, attorneys, engineers and consultants, and to Purchaser's directors, officers, employees, lenders and prospective lenders, tenants and prospective tenants, joint venture partners and prospective joint venture partners and investors and prospective investors (all being collectively referred to as the "  Related Parties  ") and (ii) as required to comply with reporting obligations imposed by law or undertakings to investors or creditors in connection with the business of Purchaser or its affiliates or to respond to a subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process issued to Purchaser or any of its affiliates or any of their respective representatives.

  15.17.3        In addition to any other remedies available to Seller and Purchaser, Seller and Purchaser shall each have the right to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief or specific performance, against the other party or its representatives in order to enforce the provisions of this   Section 15.17  . 
  15.17.4        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of   Section 15.17   shall survive the termination of this Agreement for one (1) year following the Effective Date, but shall not survive Closing.

    37 
  615220 

or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  Purchaser agrees to look solely to Seller and its assets for the satisfaction of any liability or obligation arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for the performance of any of the covenants, warranties or other agreements contained herein, and further agrees not to sue or otherwise seek to enforce any personal obligation against any of Seller's Affiliates with respect to any matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this   Section 15.19  , Purchaser hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all claims and causes of action of any nature whatsoever it may now or hereafter have against Seller's Affiliates, and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably releases and discharges  Seller s Affiliates from any and all liability whatsoever which may now or hereafter accrue in favor of Purchaser against Seller s Affiliates, in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing herein is intended to prohibit Purchaser from tracing funds distributed to Seller s Affiliates after Closing in the event that Seller has disbursed the Purchase Price proceeds and is, as a result thereof, insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. The provisions of this   Section 15.19   shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Closing. 
  15.20        Tax Deferred Exchange  .  The parties acknowledge that it may be the intent of each party to complete an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 Tax Deferred Exchange (an    Exchange   ).  Seller and Purchaser agree to cooperate in the manner necessary to complete said Exchange at no additional cost or liability to the non-exchanging party.  Each party agrees to cooperate with the other s assignees and designees by taking any action which may be reasonably and lawfully requested in structuring the sale of the Property as a tax deferred exchange, provided that (i) neither party shall be required to pay any increased costs solely as a result of so cooperating, (ii) neither party makes any representation or warranty whatsoever that the transaction will qualify as a tax deferred exchange,  (iii) closing shall be accomplished through a qualified intermediary; (iv) the Exchange shall not delay the time for Closing of the transaction as herein specified, and (v) the non-exchanging party shall not be required to take title to any other real estate.  Furthermore, the Closing Date may not be postponed solely to effectuate an Exchange. 
  15.21        Post-Closing Obligations Regarding Financial Information  .  Purchaser has advised Seller that Purchaser may be required to file, in compliance with certain laws and regulations (including, without limitation, Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission [ SEC ]), audited financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other financial information related to the Property for up to one (1) fiscal year prior to Closing and any interim period during the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs (the  Financial Information ).  If Purchaser or its principals give notice to Seller that it is (or they are) obligated to provide such information, following the Closing and for a period of ninety (90) days thereafter, Seller agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and its representatives and agents in  
  
    38 
  615220 

the preparation of the Financial Information; provided, however, Seller shall not be required to (i) incur any out of pocket expenses or costs unless Purchaser reimburses Seller for the same, (ii) provide information that was previously made available to Purchaser or (iii) make any representations or warranties other than those contained herein.  For a period of ninety (90) days after Closing, Seller shall maintain, and after reasonable advance written notice from Purchaser, Seller shall provide access to such books and records of Seller and its property manager reasonably related to the Property except as otherwise limited by this   Section 15.21  .  Further, so long as the persons in charge of management of the Property at the time of Closing remain in the employ of Seller or an affiliate of Seller (including its property manager), after reasonable written notice to Seller, it will make such persons available for interview; provided, however, that Seller shall be allowed to have other representatives present during any such interviews.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to provide any information concerning (a) Seller s, or any of Seller's affiliates  or partners  (collectively with Seller, the "Seller Financial Parties"), capital structure or debt, (b) any Seller Financial Parties' financial analyses or projections, investment analyses, account summaries or other documents prepared solely for any Seller Financial Parties' internal purposes or not directly related to the operation of the Property, (c) any Seller Financial Parties' tax returns, or (d) any Seller Financial Parties' financial statements (other than Property-level financial statements otherwise required pursuant to this   Section 15.21  ).  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser may not use any information provided pursuant to this   Section 15.21   or the results of its review or interviews pursuant to this   Section 15.21   to pursue any claim against any Seller.  As used above,  persons in charge of management of the Property  shall be defined to mean Jennifer Spara and Tim O Keefe.

  Recitals 
  This Second Amendment is made with respect to the following facts: 
  A.  Seller and Purchaser entered into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of September 15, 2016, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 19, 2016 (as amended, the    Purchase Agreement   ),     with respect to the real property located at 3000 Forrest Walk, Roswell, Georgia 30075 (the    Property   ),     as more particularly described in the Purchase Agreement. 
  B.  Seller and Purchaser desire to amend the Purchase Agreement as hereinafter set forth in this Second Amendment.   
  Agreement 
  NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing Recitals, the conditions, terms, covenants and agreements set forth in this Second Amendment, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Purchaser agree that the Purchase Agreement is amended as set forth in this Second Amendment: 
  1.  Defined Terms.    Each initially capitalized term used in this Second Amendment has the meaning set forth for that term in the Purchase Agreement, unless it is otherwise defined in this Second Amendment. 
  2.        Notice To Proceed; Election to Assume Service Contracts.    Execution of this Second Amendment by Purchaser constitutes written notice by Purchaser under Section 5.1.4 of the Purchase Agreement that Purchaser desires to proceed with the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement and acknowledgment by Purchaser that Purchaser has no further right to terminate the Purchase Agreement under Section 5.1.4 of the Purchase Agreement.  Purchaser hereby elects, pursuant to Section 7.1.2 to assume the Contracts set forth on the   Schedule 1   attached hereto and requests that Seller terminate all other Contracts. 
  3.      Satisfaction of Purchaser s Objections.    Under Section 3.2.3 of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser provided Seller with Purchaser s Objections on September 26, 2016.  Seller timely responded to Purchaser s Objections on September 28, 2016 ( Seller s Response ).  By executing this Second Amendment, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller s Response is satisfactory to Purchaser  
  
   {00830072.5 46276-000111 }      618583 

and Seller has no obligations with respect to Purchaser s Objections other than those expressly set forth in Seller s Response; provided, however, Seller has agreed to provide to Purchaser at Closing a Seller estoppel with respect the Drainage Easement Agreement dated November 14, 2013 (the  Stormwater Agreement ) pursuant to which Seller acknowledges that no amounts are due from Seller under the Stormwater Agreement, that Seller is not in default of any of Seller s obligations under the Stormwater Agreement and to Seller s knowledge, no other parties to the Stormwater Agreement are in default thereunder.   
  4.      Payment of Second Deposit  .  On the Second Amendment Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Second Deposit in the amount of $750,000.00.  
  5.      Extension of Closing Date.    Section 9.1 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to provide that the Closing Date is November 29, 2016.  Purchaser shall not be required to make the Extension Deposit in connection with the extension of the Closing Date; however, Purchaser shall have no further right under the Purchase Agreement to extend the Closing Date. Seller shall continue to have the right to extend the Closing Date to December 2, 2016, as set forth in the First Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 19, 2016, such right not being affected by this Second Amendment.    
  6.      Termination Right  .  If, on or before November 10, 2016, Purchaser has not received a letter from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources ( EPD ), in form and content reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (a) approving the Prospective Purchaser Status Compliance Report dated September 13, 2016, and (b) granting a limitation of liability to Seller and its successors, then Purchaser shall have the right, by written notice to the Seller given no later than November 20, 2016, to terminate the Purchase Agreement and, upon such termination, Purchaser shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under the Purchase Agreement, other than with respect to any matters that expressly survive the termination of the Purchase Agreement.  Seller shall in good faith diligently pursue the issuance of the letter from the EPD and deliver a copy of the aforesaid letter to Purchaser no later than one (1) Business Day following its receipt. If Purchaser shall have failed to exercise the aforesaid termination right by November 20, 2016, the termination right shall be deemed to have expired and the Purchaser shall proceed to close the purchase of the Property in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Second Amendment. 
  7.      Counterparts.    This Second Amendment may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same Second Amendment when each party has signed one of the counterparts. This Second Amendment may be delivered by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission. 
  8.      Entire Agreement.    The Purchase Agreement, as amended by this Second Amendment, constitutes the full and complete agreement and understanding between Seller and Purchaser and shall supersede all prior communications, representations, understandings or agreements, if any,  
  
   {00830072.5 46276-000111 }      2

whether oral or written, concerning the subject matter contained in the Purchase Agreement, as so amended, and no provision of the Purchase Agreement, as so amended, may be modified, amended, waived or discharged, in whole or in part, except by a written instrument executed by Seller and Purchaser.
