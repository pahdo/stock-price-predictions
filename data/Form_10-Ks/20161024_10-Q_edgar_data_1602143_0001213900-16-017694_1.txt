NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS   

Toucan
Interactive Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 28, 2014. We were
a startup company in the business of providing credit information options on all major banks located in Costa Rica, Canada, United
States and other countries located in North, Central and South America. Pursuant to the transactions described in Note 4 below,
the Company experienced a change in control and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services. The Company currently
serves as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived
advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  

NOTE
2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN   

BASIS
OF ACCOUNTING   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information and footnote
disclosures required for an annual set of financial statements prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles.
In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of August 31, 2016 and for all interim periods
presented herein have been reflected in these financial statements and the notes there to. Interim results for the six months
ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes as included in the Form
10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.  

GOING
CONCERN   

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses resulting
in an accumulated deficit of $51,911 as of August 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business
raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, to obtain the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends
to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and, or, private placement
of common stock. These financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded
asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.  

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

  The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s
results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

financial statements.  

Item
    2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

GENERAL   

Toucan
Interactive Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 24, 2014 and maintained its official business address at
Sabanilla de Montes de Oca, Urbanizacion Carmiol, Casa 254, San Jose, Costa Rica.  

From
inception until April 2016, the Company s principal business consisted of developing a website, www.NEEDforCREDIT.com, to
provide credit option services to users primarily in Costa Rica, Canada, the United States and South and Central America and to
market context advertising services to banks and financial institutions in these countries and regions.  

In
April 2016, pursuant to the transactions described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 22, 2016, the Company experienced
a change in control (the  Change of Control ) and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services. The Company
also changed the address of its principal executive offices to 25 E. Foothill Blvd., Arcadia, California 91006.  

The
Company currently serves as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to
cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any industry, specific business or geographical location
and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  

The
Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate
incurring costs related to:  

(i)    filing
                                         Exchange Act reports, and    

(ii)    investigating,
                                         analyzing and consummating a business combination.    

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned
to or invested in us by our controlling stockholder, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this
report, the Company has no cash in its treasury. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional
funding as needed.  

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there
been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company.
The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. The analysis
of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company s officers and directors. In
its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following factors:  

(a)
Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;  

(b)
Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the
industry as a whole;  

(c)
Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;  

(d)
Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through
the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;  

(e)
The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials to be acquired;  

(f)
The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced.  

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. In evaluating a prospective business
combination, the Company will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as reasonably possible.  

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Potentially available business combinations
may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. We cannot assure investors that our choice of a business combination
will result in profitable operations.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

There
have been no significant changes during the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 to the critical accounting policies
disclosed in our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29,
2016.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

We
are a development stage company and have generated minimal revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial
statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating
to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect
to raise additional capital through, among other things, loans from our controlling stockholder and the sale of equity or debt
securities. We have no committed source of financing and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise funds as and when we
need them.  

Three
and Six Month Periods Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three and Six Month Periods Ended August 31, 2015.   

We
earned no revenue during the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016. We earned $4,500 during the three and six month
periods ended August 31, 2015. We have earned minimal revenue since the date of inception.  

Our
net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was $8,448 compared to a net income of $2,193 for the three month period
ended August 31, 2015. Our net loss for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 was $24,990 compared to a net loss of $14,161
for the six month period ended August 31, 2015.  

During
the three month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $8,448 as compared to $2,307
incurred for the three month period ended August 31, 2015. During the six month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred general
and administrative expenses of $24,990 as compared to $18,681 incurred for the six month period ended August 31, 2015. General
and administrative expenses incurred during the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were generally related
to corporate overhead and administrative contracted services.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Six
Month Period Ended August 31, 2016   

As
of August 31, 2016, we had cash of $0, prepaid expenses of $5,000, liabilities of $13,233, and a working capital deficit of $8,233.
As of February 29, 2016, we had cash of $3,757, liabilities of $4,678, and a working capital deficit of $921. We expect to incur
continued losses until we acquire a company with operations and those operations are profitable.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

For
the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $25,100 and $14,161, respectively.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   

For
the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not generated any cash flows from investing activities.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

We
have financed our operations primarily from either loans or the issuance of equity. For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and
2015, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $21,343 and $(180), respectively.  

We
have generated minimal revenues from operations to date. It is not likely that we will generate any further revenues until a business
combination has been consummated. Even following a business combination, there is no guarantee that any revenues will be generated,
that any revenues will be sufficient to meet our expenses or that we will ever become profitable. We may consider a business combination
with a target company which itself has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for
expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop one or more new products or services, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.  

Moreover,
any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development or growth, including businesses
without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business
and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business
combination with a target company in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and although our management will endeavor
to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target company, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess
all significant risks.  

The
foregoing considerations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We are currently planning
on devoting the vast majority of our efforts to identifying, investigating and conducting due diligence on target companies; and
negotiating, structuring, documenting and consummating a business combination. Our long-term ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to complete a business combination and, thereafter, achieve profitable operations.  

We
believe that we will be able to meet these costs through cash on hand and additional amounts, as may be necessary, to be loaned
by or invested in us by our controlling stockholder, management and/or others. Currently, however, our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing
to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a business combination. Management s
plan includes obtaining additional funds through a combination of sales of our equity securities before, contemporaneously with,
or following, the consummation of a business combination and borrowings, although we do not believe that we will be eligible to
borrow funds from a bank until at least a business combination is consummated. However, there is no assurance that any additional
funding will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all.  

On
April 22, 2016, all the loans made by the Company s then sole director were repaid in full. Since the Change of Control
in April 2016, we rely on loans from our controlling stockholder to meet our expenses. There is no guarantee that our controlling
stockholder will continue to lend us funds to meet our expense in the future. Currently, we do not have any other arrangements
for financing. During the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016, the controlling stockholder loaned $7,911 and $8,343,
respectively, to the Company for working capital.  

We
have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available
to us on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to develop operations or meet our expenses. Additionally, any equity financing
in which we might engage would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.  

GOING
CONCERN   

The
independent auditors  audit report accompanying our financial statements dated February 29, 2016 contained an explanatory
paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
applicable.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer
or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officers also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II.   OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

We
are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse
effect on us or our business.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

An
investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks.   

Any
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Some, but not all, of the risks that affect an investment in our
Company include:  

We
                                         have little operating history and minimal revenue and there is no guarantee that we can
                                         establish a profitable operation in the foreseeable future     

We
                                         have incurred recurring net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing,
                                         we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our Company     

We
                                         face intense competition for business combination opportunities and because of our limited
                                         resources, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business
                                         opportunities and successfully completing a business combination with suitable growth
                                         potential     

We
                                         may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations
                                         and/or growth of the target business     

We
                                         have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of part-time
                                         management and members of the board of directors, working for per-diem or no cash compensation,
                                         none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and     

Our
                                         controlling stockholder and executive officers and directors currently are able to influence
                                         matters requiring stockholder approval and their interests may conflict with those of
                                         other stockholders.    

We
do not have any targets for a business combination or other transaction and we have no minimum standards for a business combination.   

We
have no arrangement, agreement, or understanding with respect to acquiring a business opportunity or engaging in a business combination
with any private entity. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities
or conclude a business combination. We have not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings,
assets, net worth or other criteria which we will require a target business opportunity to have achieved. Accordingly, we may
enter into a business combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential
for earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics.  

Our
stockholders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our common stock.   

The
following factors (there can be others) may significantly affect our stockholders  ability to resell our common stock:  

There
                                         is currently no established public trading market for our common stock, which makes it
                                         difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares    
 
         As
                                         we are currently a  shell company  as defined under Rule 144, stockholders
                                         who receive our restricted securities will not be able to sell our shares without registration
                                         until one year after we have satisfied the applicable conditions under Rule 144    
 
         Our
                                         common stock may be subject to significant restriction on resale due to federal penny
                                         stock restrictions.
