NOTE 1   GENERAL 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Spectranetics Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. These entities are collectively referred to as the  Company.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The Company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. The Company s products are available in over   65   countries and are used to cross, prepare, and treat arterial blockages in the legs and heart and to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. In June 2014, the Company acquired AngioScore, Inc. ( AngioScore ), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of cardiovascular, specialty balloon catheters, and in January 2015, the Company acquired Stellarex  ( Stellarex ) drug-coated balloon ( DCB ) assets from Covidien LP. 
    
  The Company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Management must make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, valuation allowances and reserves for receivables, inventories, deferred income tax assets, contingent consideration liabilities for acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, estimated clinical trial expenses, accrued estimates for incurred but not reported claims under partially self-insured employee health benefit programs, and loss contingencies, including those related to litigation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  The information included in the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements is unaudited and should be read with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the assets, liabilities and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is in the process of determining the timing of adoption and assessing the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the timing and method of adoption and assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its results of operations, financial position, and consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires a lessee to recognize on its balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with a lease term of more than twelve months. Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged from

  (Unaudited) 

previous GAAP.  However, changes were made to align the guidance with the lessee guidance and the new revenue recognition guidance under ASU 2014-09 referenced below. For public business entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption for lessees related to capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the timing and method of adoption and assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its results of operations, financial position, and consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASU 2014-09 contains a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  . ASU 2016-10 provides for amendments to ASU 2014-09, reducing the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improving the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . ASU 2016-12 provides for amendments to ASU 2014-09, amending the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy U.S. GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria. Under ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , issued in August 2015, these amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and both retrospective and cumulative effect methods of adoption are allowed. The Company plans to adopt these standards for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and is in the process of determining the timing and method of adoption and assessing the impact of ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments on its results of operations, financial position, and consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe they are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company.

Contingent Consideration 
    
  The Company recorded contingent liabilities as part of the AngioScore acquisition in June 2014 and the product acquisition from Upstream Peripheral Technologies, Ltd. ( Upstream ) in January 2013.  The following table presents changes to the Company s acquisition-related contingent consideration liability for the   nine  -month period ended September 30, 2016: 

In connection with the AngioScore acquisition, the Company agreed to pay additional contingent merger consideration, a portion of which included a cash payment of   $5.0 million   if the Drug-Coated AngioSculpt product ( AngioSculptX  ) received European CE mark approval by December 31, 2016.   At the acquisition date, the Company measured the liability by applying the probability-weighted scenario method. The Company used various key assumptions, such as the probability of achievement of the agreed milestones and the discount rate, in our determination of the fair value of contingent consideration. The Company received the European CE mark approval during the third quarter of 2016 and made a contingent consideration payment of   $5.0 million  ,  $2.7 million   of which was classified as a cash flow from financing activities, as it was included as part of the initial measurement of the fair value of the consideration transferred.  The remaining   $2.3 million   of the payment was classified as a cash flow from operating activities, as it was reflected in earnings as accretion expense and a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining contingent consideration liability relates to the Upstream product acquisition that occurred in the first quarter of 2013. The purchase agreement with Upstream provides for contingent consideration payments for revenue-based earn-outs through the fourth quarter of 2016 and intellectual property milestones that could be achieved on or before January 7, 2022. 

NOTE 3   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
    
  The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was as follows (in thousands). 

Goodwill is allocated to the Company s reporting units based on an analysis of both the relative historical and expected benefits. Goodwill denominated in foreign currencies within International Medical is remeasured in U.S. dollars at the applicable period-end exchange rate. There have been no events or circumstances since the last analysis as of   December 31, 2015   to indicate that the amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.

Acquired intangible assets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

___________________ 
           (1) 
    In January 2015, the Company acquired Stellarex DCB assets, which included, among other things, the intellectual property, machinery and equipment, and inventories used in connection with the Stellarex DCB catheter. 
               (3) 
    In January 2013, the Company acquired certain product lines from Upstream. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired core technology intangible assets and an intangible asset related to non-compete agreements. 
       
  In August 2016, the Company received European CE mark approval of AngioSculptX. The technology related to AngioSculptX was valued at its estimated fair value at the acquisition date and classified as in-process research and development ( IPR D ), which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the project. Upon receiving CE mark approval, which allows for commercialization of the product in Europe, the project was considered complete, and the Company capitalized the IPR D as a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over its estimated ten-year useful life.

NOTE 4   DEBT 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s total outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the maturity dates of the Company s borrowing arrangements: 

Convertible Notes 
    
  On June 3, 2014, the Company sold   $230 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.625%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2034 (the  Notes ) under an underwriting agreement dated May 28, 2014. Interest is paid semi-annually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year. The Notes mature on June 1, 2034, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the Notes. The initial conversion rate of the Notes is   31.9020   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $31.35   per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the indenture governing the Notes. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date. On or after June 5, 2018 and prior to June 5, 2021, the Company may redeem any or all of the Notes in cash if the closing price of the Company s common stock exceeds   130%   of the conversion price then in effect for a specified number of days, and on or after June 5, 2021, the Company may redeem the Notes without any such condition.  
    
  Holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes on each of June 5, 2021, June 5, 2024 and June 5, 2029, or following a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes), in each case, at a repurchase price in cash equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. 
    
  The Notes are subject to customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes. 
    
  The Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, are effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company s subsidiaries. 
    
  The Company received   $222.5 million   from the issuance of the Notes, net of   $7.5 million   of debt issuance costs incurred. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over a   seven   year period using the effective interest method and are

  (Unaudited) 

included in the line  Convertible senior notes, net of debt issuance costs  on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company used all of the net proceeds to fund the acquisition of AngioScore.  
    
  Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility 
    
  On December 7, 2015, the Company entered into a term credit and security agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ) and a revolving credit and security agreement (the  Revolving Loan Credit Agreement,  and together with the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the  Credit Agreements ) with MidCap Financial Trust and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreements replaced the Credit and Security Agreement (the  Wells Fargo Credit Agreement ) entered into by the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association on February 25, 2011. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a   five  -year   $60 million   term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement provides for a   five  -year   $50 million   revolving loan facility (the  Revolving Loan Facility ). The Revolving Loan Facility may be increased to up to   $70 million  , subject to lender approval. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreements are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company.  
    
  The Term Loan Facility bears interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of   7.50%   per annum; provided that the applicable margin will be reduced to   6.50%   if the Company s EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is equal to or greater than   $6 million   for a specified prior period and no default or event of default has occurred and is occurring.  The Company may prepay all or a portion of the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain conditions and a prepayment fee, as specified in the Credit Agreements. The Term Loan Facility is subject to an exit fee of   4.0%   of the amount advanced under the Term Loan Facility. Interest-only payments are due during the first 24 months of the Term Loan Facility, payable monthly in arrears, with principal payments beginning thereafter in equal monthly installments until maturity, provided that the Company may postpone making principal payments for an additional 12 months if certain conditions are met and the Administrative Agent and lenders agree to such extension. If the Administrative Agent and lenders do not agree to such extension, the prepayment fee and unearned portion of the exit fee will be waived. 
    
  The Company may borrow under the Revolving Loan Facility subject to borrowing base limitations, which allow the Company to borrow based on the value of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing base was   $36.3 million  , based on the Company s accounts receivable and inventory balances. Amounts drawn under the Revolving Loan Facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement) plus   4.45%   per annum, payable monthly in arrears, while the undrawn portion is subject to an unused line fee of   0.5%   per annum. The Revolving Loan Facility is subject to a minimum balance, such that the Company pays the greater of (i) interest accrued on the actual amount drawn under the Revolving Loan Facility and (ii) interest accrued on   35%   of the average borrowing base prior to the first anniversary of the Revolving Loan Facility and   50%   of the average borrowing base thereafter. The Company may prepay and re-borrow amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit without penalty.   
    
  The Credit Agreements require the Company to maintain minimum cash and cash equivalents of not less than   $10 million   and achieve net revenue in excess of certain specified thresholds. These agreements also contain certain restrictive covenants that limit and in some circumstances prohibit, the Company s ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer its assets, pay dividends on the Company s common stock, make capital expenditures and investments, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, repurchase common stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Credit Agreements contain customary events of default, including the failure to make required payments, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements, the occurrence of a material adverse change, failure to pay certain other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the Credit Agreements may be accelerated. The Company had no events of default as of   September 30, 2016  .

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility had outstanding balances of   $60.0 million   and   $21.3 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was   8.02%  , and the weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Loan Facility was   4.97%  .  

NOTE 5   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  The Company maintains equity plans that provide for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units ( PSUs ), dividend equivalents, cash incentive awards and other stock-based awards. The plans provide that stock options may be granted with exercise prices not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted through   September 30, 2016   generally vest over   four years   and expire   ten years   from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors vest over   one year  . Restricted stock units granted to certain employees of the Company vest over   four years  . Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock upon the occurrence of certain specified events.  
    
  On March 15, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors adopted, and stockholders approved at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders in June 2016, The Spectranetics Corporation 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the  2016 Plan ), which authorizes the issuance for award grants of   2,500,000   shares of the Company s common stock, plus the number of shares of common stock remaining available for future grants under the Company s Amended and Restated 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the  2006 Plan ) on the date the Company s stockholders approved the 2016 Plan. No further awards will be made under the 2006 Plan.  
    
  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a grant of PSUs to certain of the Company s officers in June 2014 and a grant of PSUs to the Company s Chief Financial Officer in September 2015 upon the commencement of her employment (the  2014 PSUs ). The 2014 PSUs vest based on achieving specified performance measurements over a   three  -year  cliff  performance period plus an additional one year  cliff  time vesting. Earned 2014 PSUs vest   75%   upon completion of the   three  -year performance period and   25%     one   year after the performance period. The 2014 PSUs have payout opportunities of between   0%   and   250%  . The performance targets include a compounded annual growth rate for revenue over a three-year period and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
    
  In June 2016, the Board of Directors approved the grant of PSUs (the  2016 PSUs ) to the Company s named executive officers and certain other employees pursuant to the 2016 Plan.  The 2016 PSUs provide, among other things, that (i) the 2016 PSUs have an initial performance period of up to   four   years from the date of grant during which the target number of 2016 PSUs awarded to each recipient may be earned if approval of the Company s Stellarex products is received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA  (ii) the 2016 PSUs have a supplemental performance period of   six   calendar quarters following the calendar quarter in which FDA approval of the Company s Stellarex products is received, and during which up to an additional   100%   of the target number of 2016 PSUs may be earned depending on the degree to which the Company s Stellarex products achieve specified U.S. market share goals; and (iii) no 2016 PSUs will be earned (and no supplemental performance period will occur) if the Company s Stellarex products do not receive FDA approval during the initial four year performance period. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   3.0 million   shares available for future issuance under the Company s incentive award plans, assuming issuance of common stock underlying all outstanding PSUs at target performance, and   1.3 million   shares available, assuming issuance of common stock underlying all outstanding PSUs at maximum performance. 
    
  Valuation and Expense Information 
    
  The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $3.7 million   and   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10.3 million   and   $9.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This expense consisted of compensation expense related to (1) employee stock options based on the value of share-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period, (2) restricted stock awards issued to certain of the Company s directors, (3) restricted stock units issued to certain of the Company s employees, (4) PSUs

     Table of Contents  
  THE SPECTRANETICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

issued to certain of the Company s officers and other employees, and (5) the fair value of shares issued under the Company s employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company recognizes compensation expense for non-performance related awards on a straight-line basis over the service period. 
    
  With respect to the PSUs, the number of shares that vest and are issued to the recipient is based upon the Company s performance as measured against the specified targets over the relevant performance period for each PSU grant as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company estimates the fair value of the PSUs based on its closing stock price on the date of grant and its estimates of achieving such performance targets and records compensation expense on a graded vesting attribution method, which recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over each separately vesting portion of the awards. Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted based upon the Company s estimate of achieving such performance targets. The number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on the actual performance metrics as set forth in the applicable PSU award agreement. 
    
  The fair value of each share option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model based on assumptions noted in the following table. The Company s employee stock options have various restrictions including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfers and hedging, among others, and are often exercised prior to their contractual expiration. Expected volatilities used in the fair value estimate are based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate share option exercises, expected term and employee departure behavior used in the Black-Scholes pricing model. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual term of the share option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant.  
    
  The following is a summary of the assumptions used for the stock options granted during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, using the Black-Scholes pricing model: 

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $10.43   and   $5.98  , respectively, and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $6.84   and   $10.36  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes stock option activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value based on the Company s closing stock price of   $25.09   as of   September 30, 2016   that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of shares underlying in-the-money options exercisable as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   1.8 million  . The total intrinsic value of options exercised was   $1.8 million   and   $8.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following table summarizes restricted stock award activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

The following table summarizes PSU activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $21.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company s incentive award plans, using the Company s current estimate of performance for the PSUs, which could be higher or lower in the future based on the actual achievement of performance targets. This expense is based on an assumed future forfeiture rate of approximately   6.68%   per year for stock options and restricted stock units for Company employees and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.6   years. 
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan    
    
  On December 9, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors adopted, and stockholders approved at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders in June 2016, an amendment to The Spectranetics Corporation 2010 Employee Stock Purchase  

13 

     Table of Contents  
  THE SPECTRANETICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Plan ( ESPP ) to increase the number of shares of common stock available for sale under the ESPP by   1,000,000   shares. The amendment was effective as of January 1, 2016, the first day of the 2016 semi-annual offering period under the ESPP.  
    
  The ESPP, as amended, provides for the sale of up to   1,700,000   shares of common stock to eligible employees, limited to the lesser of   2,500   shares per employee per   six  -month period or a fair market value of   $25,000   per employee per calendar year. Stock purchased under the ESPP is restricted from sale for   one   year following the date of purchase. Stock can be purchased from amounts accumulated through payroll deductions during each   six  -month period. The purchase price is equal to   85%   of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the beginning or end of the respective   six  -month offering period. This discount does not exceed the maximum discount rate permitted for plans of this type under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The ESPP is compensatory for financial reporting purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   0.9 million   shares available for future issuance under the ESPP.  
    
  The fair value of the shares offered within the semi-annual purchase periods under the ESPP is determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected term of   six months   is based upon the offering period of the ESPP. Expected volatility is determined based on the historical volatility from daily share price observations for the Company s stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the ESPP. The risk-free interest rate is based on the six-month U.S. Treasury daily yield rate. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company s historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to its stockholders. The Company recognized compensation expense related to the ESPP of   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.0 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

NOTE 6   NET LOSS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (excluding shares of restricted stock). Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic net loss per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period, which include the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of restricted stock using the treasury stock method, and the assumed conversion of shares under the Notes using the  if-converted  method. 
    
  Options to purchase common stock, the vesting of restricted stock and PSUs, and shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are considered to be potentially dilutive common shares but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as a result of the net losses incurred in those periods. Therefore, diluted net loss per share was the same as basic net loss per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, PSUs, and shares issuable upon the conversion of the Notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are shown in the table below:

NOTE 7   SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  The Company operates in   one   distinct line of business consisting of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing disposable products and a proprietary excimer laser system to treat certain vascular and coronary conditions. 
    
  Within this line of business, the Company has   two   operating segments, which are identified on a geographic basis: (1) U.S. Medical and (2) International Medical. U.S. Medical and International Medical offer substantially the same products and services but operate in different geographic regions, have different distribution networks, and different regulatory environments. The primary performance measure for the operating segments is revenue. 
    
  Additional information regarding each operating segment is discussed below. 
    
  U. S. Medical 
    
  Products offered by this segment include medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system, including fiber-optic devices and non-fiber-optic products (disposables), an excimer laser system (equipment), and the service of the excimer laser system (service). The Company is subject to product approvals from the FDA and Health Canada. The Company s products are used in multiple vascular procedures, including peripheral atherectomy, crossing arterial blockages, coronary atherectomy and thrombectomy, and the removal of cardiac lead wires from patients with pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators. This segment s customers are primarily located in the United States and Canada. 
    
  U.S. Medical also includes the corporate headquarters of the Company. All manufacturing, research and development, and corporate administrative functions are performed within this operating segment. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , a portion of research, development and other technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses incurred in the U.S. has been allocated to International Medical based on a percentage of revenue because these expenses support the Company s ability to generate revenue within the International Medical segment. 
    
  Manufacturing activities are performed within the U.S. Medical segment. Revenue associated with intersegment product transfers to International Medical was   $3.2 million   and   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10.1 million   and   $9.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Revenue is based upon transfer prices, which provide for intersegment profit eliminated upon consolidation.

  (Unaudited) 

International Medical 
    
  The International Medical segment has its headquarters in the Netherlands, and serves Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Puerto Rico. Products offered by this segment are substantially the same as those offered by U.S. Medical, except that Stellarex DCB and AngioSculptX products are available for sale in Europe and certain other international markets but are not yet approved for sale in the U.S. The Company is subject to product approvals from various international regulatory bodies. The International Medical segment is engaged primarily in distribution activities. Certain U.S.-incurred research, development and other technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses have been allocated to International Medical based on a percentage of revenue because these expenses support the Company s ability to generate revenue within the International Medical segment. 
    
  Summary financial information relating to operating segment operations is shown below. Intersegment transfers as well as intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from the information provided (in thousands): 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   individual customer represented 10% or more of consolidated revenue.   No   individual country, other than the United States, represented 10% or more of consolidated revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

Revenue by Product Line 

NOTE 8   INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company recorded income tax expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, consisting of current foreign and state income tax expense and deferred federal and state income tax expense. The Company s deferred U.S. federal and state tax expense in   2016   primarily represents an increase in the deferred tax liability related to the difference between tax and book accounting for the portion of its goodwill that is tax-deductible, which is amortized over   15 years   for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes. Given its continuing tax losses, the Company does not expect to incur current U.S. federal tax expense or benefit against its pretax income during the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately   $90.9 million  . The Company maintains a valuation allowance against substantially all of its deferred tax assets, in excess of its nettable deferred tax liabilities, that it does not consider to meet the more-likely-than-not criteria for recognition. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets ( DTAs ), management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The Company s ability to realize the benefit of its DTAs in future periods will depend on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the Company s projected future taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Because the Company expects to generate losses during the Stellarex development period through 2017, it believes that it will not be generating sufficient taxable income to realize DTAs. The Company will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods and does not expect to reduce the valuation allowance against its DTAs until it has a sufficient historical trend of taxable income and can predict future income with a higher degree of certainty. In the event there is a change in circumstances in the future that would affect the utilization of the Company s DTAs, the tax provision in that period would be adjusted by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable. 

NOTE 9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
    
  Litigation 
    
  The Company is from time to time subject to, and is presently involved in, various pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings, including those that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes the financial impacts of which are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims, settlements, and judgments where management has assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company s significant legal proceedings are discussed below. The costs associated with such proceedings or other legal

proceedings that may be commenced could have a material adverse effect on the Company s future consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
    
  For certain cases described herein, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss, if any, or range of possible loss because, among other reasons, (i) the proceedings are in various stages; (ii) damages may not have been sought; (iii) damages may be determined to be unsupported; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties.  For these cases, however, the Company does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 
     
  TriReme Patent Infringement and Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
    
  In July 2012, AngioScore sued TriReme Medical, Inc. ( TriReme ), Eitan Konstantino ( Konstantino ), Quattro Vascular Pte, Ltd. ( Quattro ), and QT Vascular Ltd. ( QT Vascular ), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the  Court ), alleging patent infringement (the  Northern District of California Action ). In this action, AngioScore, the plaintiff, sought injunctive relief and damages. In June 2014, AngioScore amended its complaint (i) to allege that TriReme s Chief Executive Officer, Konstantino, who is a former founder, officer, and member of the board of directors of AngioScore, breached his fiduciary duties to AngioScore by developing the Chocolate balloon catheter while he served as a member of the AngioScore board of directors, and (ii) to add claims against the other defendants for aiding and abetting that breach. 
    
  Trial on the breach of fiduciary duty case occurred in April 2015. In July 2015, the Court ruled in favor of AngioScore, finding that Konstantino breached his fiduciary duties to AngioScore, that TriReme and Quattro aided and abetted that breach, and that QT Vascular is liable for the acts of TriReme and Quattro. In its ruling, the Court found that Konstantino breached his fiduciary duties to AngioScore by developing the Chocolate balloon catheter while serving on the AngioScore board of directors and failing to present that corporate opportunity to AngioScore. Konstantino subsequently launched the product through TriReme, Quattro and QT Vascular. The Court awarded AngioScore   $20.034 million   against all defendants plus disgorgement from Konstantino of all benefits he accrued from his breach of fiduciary duties, including amounts he received for assigning his intellectual property rights to the Chocolate balloon, a royalty on past and future sales of the Chocolate balloon, and all of his shares and options in QT Vascular. 
    
  Trial on the patent infringement case was held in September 2015. The jury found against AngioScore in the patent infringement case and found that certain of the asserted claims of the patent are invalid. The patent infringement verdict has no impact on the Court s findings or award of damages in connection with the breach of fiduciary duty claims or the ability of AngioScore to recover fees and costs advanced to Konstantino, as discussed below. The Court entered judgment in both the breach of fiduciary duty case and the patent infringement case in October 2015.  The defendants filed an appeal of the rulings with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the  Federal Circuit ). On July 21, 2016, the Federal Circuit reversed the breach of fiduciary duty and state law rulings on procedural grounds, finding that the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the state law claims. The Federal Circuit also affirmed the Court s ruling that the defendants are not entitled to attorneys  fees in the patent infringement case. No part of the potential financial award associated with this matter has been previously reflected in the Company s financial statements.  The Company has filed with the Federal Circuit a petition for rehearing of the order reversing the trial court s breach of fiduciary duty and state law rulings.  
    
  TriReme Inventorship 
    
  In June 2014, TriReme sued AngioScore in the Court seeking to change the inventorship of certain patents owned by AngioScore. TriReme alleged that an Israeli physician, Chaim Lotan, should be named as a co-inventor on   three   patents owned by AngioScore. Dr. Lotan allegedly assigned any rights he may have had in the three patents to TriReme. AngioScore moved to dismiss this litigation in January 2015, asserting that Dr. Lotan previously assigned any rights he may have had in the patents to AngioScore in 2003. In March 2015, the Court granted AngioScore s motion to dismiss this case. TriReme appealed the Court s

ruling, and on February 5, 2016, an appellate court reversed the Court s ruling dismissing the case and remanded the case for further proceedings, which are ongoing. 
    
  Konstantino Indemnification and Advancement of Fees  
    
  In May 2014, AngioScore sued Konstantino in the Superior Court for the County of Alameda, State of California, seeking a declaratory judgment that AngioScore owes no indemnification obligations to Konstantino under the indemnification agreement between AngioScore and Konstantino (the  AngioScore Indemnification Agreement ) resulting from AngioScore s claim that Konstantino breached his fiduciary duties to AngioScore while serving as a member of the board of directors of AngioScore (the  Alameda Action ). In November 2014, the court stayed the Alameda Action pending the outcome of the Northern District of California Action.    
    
  In May 2014, Konstantino sued AngioScore in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the  Delaware Action ) seeking a ruling that, under the AngioScore Indemnification Agreement, AngioScore must indemnify and advance Konstantino s attorneys  fees and costs related to the defense of the breach of fiduciary duty claims in the Northern District of California Action and the Alameda Action and his pursuit of the Delaware Action for advancement of fees. In June 2014, AngioScore filed counter-claims against Konstantino for violating the AngioScore Indemnification Agreement, which requires, in part, that he cooperate in identifying other sources of advancement, and AngioScore filed a third-party complaint against TriReme, Quattro, and QT Vascular seeking contribution from the defendant companies for amounts advanced to Konstantino. Konstantino filed a motion for summary judgment that he is entitled to advancement from AngioScore and, in August 2014, the court granted the motion. In September 2014, AngioScore filed amended counterclaims and an amended third-party complaint that included additional defendant TriReme Singapore. The defendant companies filed a motion to dismiss the amended third-party complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a claim and the court does not have jurisdiction over three of the defendant companies that were incorporated in Singapore. In October 2015, the court denied the defendant companies  motion to dismiss, and AngioScore filed a motion for summary judgment against the defendant companies seeking reimbursement and contribution of fees AngioScore advanced to Konstantino.  In November 2015, the court granted in part AngioScore s motion and ordered that TriReme is liable for 50% of advanced fees and costs, and must pay all fees and costs to be advanced moving forward until such fees and costs equal the fees and costs paid by AngioScore. Thereafter, the fees and costs will be advanced 50% by TriReme and 50% by AngioScore. 
    
  The Company cannot at this time determine the likelihood of any outcome and, as of   September 30, 2016  , has   no   amounts accrued for potential damages. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred   $1.5 million   in legal fees associated with these matters. These expenses are included within the  Acquisition transaction, integration and legal costs  line of the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  
    
  Shareholder Litigation 
    
  On August 27, 2015, a person purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased securities of the Company between February 19, 2015 and July 23, 2015 filed a lawsuit against the Company and certain of its officers in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that certain of the Company s public statements concerning its projected revenue for 2015 were false and misleading. On December 18, 2015, the court appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On March 1, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, including additional allegations challenging certain statements in addition to those concerning the Company s projected revenue for 2015. The class period in the amended complaint runs from February 27, 2014 to July 23, 2015. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and is defending itself vigorously. In June 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, plaintiffs filed their response in July 2016, and the Company filed its reply brief in August 2016. The Company cannot at this time determine the likelihood of any outcome or whether the impact will be material and, as of   September 30, 2016  , has   no   amounts accrued for potential damages in this case. An adverse outcome in the lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition.

  The Company is involved in other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Voluntary Recall 
    
  In late October 2016, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of specific lots produced since April 2016 of its ELCA Coronary Laser Atherectomy Catheter, Turbo Elite Laser Atherectomy Catheter, and Bridge Occlusion Balloon products.  The recall is due to potentially compromised integrity of sterile packaging of the products caused by pinholes in the outer package.  The decision to initiate this recall was not based on any reported adverse events or customer complaints.  The FDA was informed of this action and agreed to the Company s recall plan to replace units impacted.  In addition, the Company is in the process of making required communications to various regulatory bodies outside of the United States.  A manufacturing change has been implemented to correct the issue. The Company does not anticipate that this recall will materially impact its financial statements.

Corporate Overview 
    
  We develop, manufacture, market and distribute primarily single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. Our products are used to cross, prepare, and treat arterial blockages in the legs and heart and to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. We believe that the diversified nature of our business allows us to respond to a wide range of physician and patient needs. The innovative products and services we offer are divided into three categories: 

Vascular Intervention ( VI ): Our broad portfolio of VI devices consists of laser and aspiration catheters, AngioSculpt        scoring balloon catheters, support catheters, and Stellarex  drug-coated balloon ( DCB ) catheters, which we sell in Europe and currently are not for sale in the U.S. 
                
    Lead Management ( LM ): We are a global leader in devices for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. Our primary LM devices consist of our excimer laser sheaths, non-laser mechanical sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. 
                
    Laser, service, and other: Our proprietary excimer laser system, the CVX-300 , is approved in approximately 50 countries for use in multiple minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. We sell, rent and service our CVX-300 laser systems. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our disposable products generated 94% of our revenue, of which VI products accounted for 71% and LM products accounted for 29%. The remainder of our revenue is derived from sales and rental of our laser system and related services.   
    
  Approximately half of our disposable product revenue is currently derived from products used with our proprietary CVX-300       excimer laser system. Our laser catheters contain up to 250 small diameter, flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter.

Recent Developments 
    
  In February 2016, we received 510(k) regulatory clearance for our Bridge  Occlusion Balloon product. Bridge is a balloon designed to dramatically reduce blood loss in the event of a tear in the superior vena cava during a lead extraction procedure. The device is designed to give the physician adequate time to safely transition the patient for surgical repair and to give the surgeon the benefit of a clear field of view to repair the tear. Although a superior vena cava tear is a rare occurrence, we believe that this product is an important innovation in an effort to accomplish our goal of reducing the risk of mortality during lead extraction procedures. 
    
  In April 2016, Professor Thomas Zeller presented the first interim analysis of 12-month interim data from the ILLUMENATE Global Study at the Charing Cross Symposium in London, England. The ILLUMENATE Global Study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study designed to assess the clinical performance of the Stellarex  drug-coated balloon ( DCB ) in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Subsequently, in June 2016, Dr. Prakash Krishnan presented the second interim analysis of 12-month data from the ILLUMENATE Global Study at the New Cardiovascular Horizons annual conference in New Orleans, Louisiana. Interim results from 220 patients (247 lesions) of the 371 patients enrolled demonstrated a primary patency rate of 90.3% at day 360 and 86.5% at day 365. Freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) was 93.9% at both day 360 and day 365. These interim results include a larger number of patients than, and are consistent with, the initial ILLUMENATE Global Study 12-month interim analysis and the ILLUMENATE First-In-Human Study results. 
    
  In August 2016, Professor Marianne Brodmann presented the final 12-month results of the DCB ILLUMENATE European Randomized Clinical Trial ( EU RCT ) at the Amputation Prevention Symposium in Chicago, Illinois. The EU RCT Trial enrolled 328 patients, 295 of whom were randomized to treatment with the DCB or a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ).  The key results at day 365 include primary patency (per Kaplan-Meier survival estimates), which was 89.0% for the DCB group and 65.0% for the PTA group, and freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (per Kaplan-Meier survival estimates), which was 94.8% for the DCB group and 85.3% for the PTA group.  
    
  In May 2016, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to observed non-conformities with current Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ), as defined by the FDA, at our Colorado Springs, Colorado facility.  In January 2016, following an inspection of certain of our manufacturing facilities from late 2015 to early 2016, the FDA issued a Form 483, List of Inspectional Observations, identifying certain observed non-conformities with current GMP.  Following the receipt of the Form 483, we provided written responses to the FDA detailing corrective actions underway to address the FDA s observations. The FDA warning letter acknowledges the actions already taken by us to address the observations. We plan to continue to respond timely and fully to the FDA s requests and we are working diligently to fully remediate the FDA s observations regarding the Colorado Springs facility. We anticipate that we will incur incremental expenses in this regard, which may be significant. We are continuing to manufacture and ship disposable products from the Colorado Springs facility and do not anticipate that customer orders will be impacted while we work to resolve the FDA s concerns.  Until the violations are corrected, we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including recalls, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances, and fines or civil penalties. 
    
  In August 2016, we received European CE mark approval for the AngioSculptX Drug-coated percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) Scoring Balloon Catheter ( AngioSculptX ).  AngioSculptX combines the AngioSculpt PTCA scoring balloon catheter with a drug coating. It is indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis, including in-stent restenosis. 
    
  In October 2016, we submitted the Stellarex 0.014  Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) to the FDA for the planned 0.014  below-the-knee randomized clinical study.  This purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex 0.014  DCB for the treatment of lesions in below-the-knee arteries compared to a standard PTA catheter.

Revenue and gross margin    
    
  In the following discussion, we disclose all growth rates on an  as reported  basis, and we specify the growth rate on a  constant currency  basis only when it differs from the  as reported  growth rate. See the  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section below for a discussion of our use of the constant currency financial measure.  The following is a summary of revenue by product line for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Percentage amounts may not add due to rounding.    
       
  Revenue increased   $6.6 million  , or   11%  , from   $61.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $68.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in VI disposables revenue, described further below.  
      
  VI revenue, which includes revenue from products used in the peripheral and coronary vascular systems, increased   $5.5 million  , or   14%   (  13%   on a constant currency basis), from   $40.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $45.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in VI revenue was driven primarily by unit volume increases in our peripheral atherectomy and coronary atherectomy products.  
    
  LM revenue, which includes revenue from excimer laser sheaths, mechanical sheaths, and cardiac lead management accessories for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads, increased   $0.7 million  , or   4%  , from   $18.0 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $18.6 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The growth was primarily due to revenue from mechanical tools and accessory products, including our newly-introduced Bridge product, partially offset by a decrease in laser sheath revenue due to a decrease in unit volumes. 
    
  Laser, service, and other revenue increased   $0.4 million  , or   12%   (  13%   constant currency), from   $3.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $3.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , with an increase in laser sales revenue offset by a slight decrease in laser rental and service revenue. 
    
  We placed   52   laser systems during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   41   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Of these laser placements,   36   lasers were newly manufactured, and   16   lasers were redeployed from a previous institution.  The new placements during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to   1,478   (  1,060   in the U.S.) as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1,372   (  972   in the U.S.) as of   September 30, 2015  .  
           
  Geographically, revenue in the U.S. increased   $5.1 million  , or   10%  , from   $51.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $57.0 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in VI revenue.  International revenue increased   $1.5 million  , or   16%   (  15%   on a constant currency basis), from   $9.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $11.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in international revenue was primarily due to an increase in VI revenue, primarily driven by an increase in AngioSculpt and Stellarex revenue.

  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

Gross margin was   75%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   74%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Increased production efficiencies and a favorable sales mix of disposable products primarily contributed to our improved gross margin during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . These improvements were partially offset by lower margins on laser revenue during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Operating expenses    
    
       Total operating expenses increased   $3.0 million  , or   5%  , from   $58.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $61.2 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table shows the changes in operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)  Percentage amounts may not add due to rounding.    
     
  Selling, general and administrative.    Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased   $6.6 million  , or   19%  , from   $34.1 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $40.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses, as a result of the following: 

an increase of approximately $3.9 million due to the expansion of our sales and marketing teams to support the launch of Stellarex DCB products; 
                
    an increase of approximately $1.6 million in expense related to the Company s performance bonus plan; 
                
    an increase in commission expense of approximately $1.2 million on higher revenue; and 
                
    an increase of approximately $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense due to performance and our organizational growth.  
       
  Research, development and other technology.    Research, development and other technology expenses increased   $0.8 million  , or   5%  , from   $15.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $16.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Costs included within research, development and other technology expenses are product development costs, clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third-party licensors. The increase in research, development and other technology expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the Stellarex DCB research, development and clinical studies of approximately $0.6 million, and, to a lesser extent, increases in royalty expenses for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Acquisition transaction, integration and legal costs.    We incurred   $0.8 million   of costs related to the AngioScore acquisition for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily related to legal fees associated with a breach of fiduciary duty and patent matters, further described in Note 9,  Commitments and Contingencies,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

In the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $5.4 million   of costs related to acquisitions. Of this amount,   $2.5 million   was comprised of legal fees associated with a patent infringement and breach of fiduciary duty matter. We also incurred $0.2 million of severance, retention and consulting costs for the integration of AngioScore. Stellarex acquisition costs of $2.7 million primarily consisted of non-recurring costs associated with establishing manufacturing operations to support the Stellarex program. 
    
  Intangible asset amortization.   As part of our recent acquisitions, we acquired certain amortizable intangible assets. We recorded   $2.9 million   of amortization expense related to these intangible assets for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   $3.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . See Note 3,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  
    
  Contingent consideration expense.    For the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we recorded approximately   $41,000   and   $0.4 million   of contingent consideration expense, respectively, related to our contingent consideration liabilities from the AngioScore and Upstream acquisitions, due to the passage of time (i.e., accretion). The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability during 2015, which eliminated the liability for future AngioScore revenue-related contingent payments. 
    
  Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability.   During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we remeasured the contingent consideration liability related to the regulatory milestones included in the AngioScore acquisition to its fair value and reduced it by approximately $4.3 million as a result of a thorough analysis we performed related to the costs and efforts remaining to complete the Drug-Coated AngioSculpt ( DCAS ) projects, which are subject to contingent regulatory milestone payments. This analysis resulted in a determination that it was unlikely we would meet the regulatory milestones for two of the three DCAS projects within the time frame and with the expenditure of funds set forth in the acquisition agreement.  
    
  Intangible asset impairment.   During the three months ended September 30, 2015, following the analysis of the contingent consideration liability discussed above, we recorded an intangible asset impairment of $2.5 million to for a partial impairment of the in-process research and development intangible assets acquired as part of the AngioScore acquisition.  
    
  Medical device excise tax.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 imposed a medical device excise tax on medical device manufacturers on their sales in the U.S. of certain devices, which was effective January 1, 2013. Legislation enacted in December 2015 suspended the medical device excise tax for 2016 and 2017, resulting in no expense incurred for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Other expense 
    
  Total other expense increased   $1.4 million  , or   76%  , from   $1.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $3.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table shows the changes in other expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

26 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of   $1.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily related to the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility entered into by the Company in December 2015.  
    
  Income tax expense  
           
  We recorded income tax expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, consisting of current foreign and state income tax expense and deferred federal and state income tax expense.  
    
  Our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in future periods will depend on the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Due to our history of losses and our planned near-term investments in our growth, we have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets that are in excess of our deferred tax liabilities.  We do not expect to reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until we have a sufficient historical trend of taxable income and can predict future taxable income with a higher degree of certainty.  
    
  Net loss 
           
  Net loss decreased   $1.2 million  , from   $14.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   to   $13.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Net loss in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   was lower than the net loss in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the decrease in operating loss, partially offset by the increase in other expense, as described above.

Revenue and gross margin 
    
  The following is a summary of revenue by product line for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)  Percentage amounts may not add due to rounding.    
    
  Revenue increased   $18.1 million  , or   10%  , from   $180.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $198.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in VI disposables revenue, described further below.  
    
  VI revenue increased   $16.5 million  , or   14%  , from   $117.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $134.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in VI revenue was driven primarily by unit volume increases in our peripheral atherectomy and coronary atherectomy products. 
    
  LM revenue increased   $1.8 million  , or   4%  , from   $51.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $53.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The growth was primarily due to revenue from auxiliary products and mechanical tools, including our newly-introduced Bridge product, offset by a decrease in laser sheath revenue due to a decrease in unit volumes. 
    
  Laser, service, and other revenue decreased   $0.2 million  , or   2%  , from   $11.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $11.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a decrease in laser rental revenue, partially offset by an increase in laser sales. 
    
  We placed 141 laser systems during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with 144 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Of these laser placements, 86 lasers were newly manufactured, and 55 lasers were redeployed from a previous institution.  The new placements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to 1,478 (1,060 in the U.S.) as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to 1,372 (972 in the U.S.) as of   September 30, 2015  .  
           
  Geographically, revenue in the U.S. increased   $14.2 million  , or   9%  , from   $152.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $166.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in VI revenue.  International revenue increased   $3.9 million  , or   14%  , from   $28.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $32.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in international revenue was primarily due to an increase in VI revenue, principally driven by an increase in AngioSculpt and Stellarex revenue.  
    
  Gross margin was   75%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with 74% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was negatively impacted by $0.3 million of amortization of acquired inventory step-up in the first quarter of 2015. Increased production efficiencies and a favorable sales mix of disposable products contributed to our improved gross margin during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These improvements were partially offset by lower margins on laser revenue during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

SG A expenses increased   $15.5 million  , or   15%  , from   $106.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $122.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses, as a result of the following: 

an increase of approximately $5.0 million due to the expansion of our sales and marketing teams to support the launch of Stellarex DCB products; 
                
    an increase in commission expense of approximately $4.2 million on higher revenue 
                
    an increase of approximately $2.3 million in expense related to the Company s performance bonus plan; and 
                
    an increase of approximately $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense due to performance and our organizational growth.  
       
  Research, development and other technology.    Research, development and other technology expenses increased   $2.9 million  , or   6%  , from   $47.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $50.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in research, development and other technology expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the Stellarex DCB research, development and clinical studies of approximately $2.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Acquisition transaction, integration and legal costs.    We incurred   $1.6 million   of costs related to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily related to legal fees associated with a breach of fiduciary duty and patent matters, further described in Note 9,  Commitments and Contingencies,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.  
    
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $26.9 million   of costs related to acquisitions. Of this amount, $18.9 million was comprised of legal fees associated with the patent infringement and breach of fiduciary duty matter. We also incurred $1.4 million of severance, retention and consulting costs for the integration of AngioScore. Stellarex acquisition costs of $6.6 million primarily included legal and investment banking fees related to the closing of the acquisition and non-recurring costs associated with establishing manufacturing operations to support the Stellarex program.

Intangible asset amortization.   As part of our recent acquisitions, we acquired certain amortizable intangible assets. We recorded   $9.3 million   and   $10.1 million   of amortization expense related to these intangible assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  See Note 3,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  
    
  Contingent consideration expense.    For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $0.2 million   and   $2.5 million   of contingent consideration expense, respectively, related to our contingent consideration liabilities from the AngioScore and Upstream acquisitions, due to the passage of time (i.e., accretion). The period-over-period decrease was primarily due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability during 2015, which eliminated the liability for future AngioScore revenue-related contingent payments.  
    
  Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability.   As of September 30, 2015, we remeasured the contingent consideration liability related to the AngioScore acquisition to its fair value and reduced it by approximately   $22.1 million  . This reduction was the result of a $17.8 million adjustment made in the second quarter of 2015 for a decrease in our revenue estimates for the AngioSculpt products and a $4.3 million adjustment made in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of a thorough analysis we performed related to the costs and efforts remaining to complete the DCAS projects, which are subject to contingent regulatory milestone payments. This analysis resulted in a determination that it was unlikely we would meet the regulatory milestones for two of the three DCAS projects within the time frame and with the expenditure of funds set forth in the acquisition agreement. 
    
  Intangible asset impairment.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, following the analysis of the contingent consideration liability discussed above, we recorded an intangible asset impairment of $2.5 million for a partial impairment of the in-process research and development intangible assets acquired as part of the AngioScore acquisition.  
    
  Medical device excise tax.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 imposed a medical device excise tax on medical device manufacturers on their sales in the U.S. of certain devices, which was effective January 1, 2013. Legislation enacted in December 2015 suspended the medical device excise tax for 2016 and 2017, resulting in no expense incurred for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Other expense 
    
  Total other expense increased   $4.3 million  , or   76%  , from   $5.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $9.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table shows the changes in other expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)  Percentage amounts may not add due to rounding.    
    
  The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of   $4.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily related to the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility entered into by the Company in December 2015. In addition, other expense was impacted by a   $0.3 million   fluctuation in foreign currency transaction impact from a loss to a gain for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The foreign currency impact largely resulted

  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

from the settlement of dollar-based intercompany transactions with our Dutch subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro, and a strengthening of the euro during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Income tax expense  
           
  We recorded income tax expense of   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, consisting of current foreign and state income tax expense and deferred federal and state income tax expense.  
    
  Our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in future periods will depend on the generation of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Due to our history of losses and our planned near-term investments in our growth, we have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets that are in excess of our deferred tax liabilities.  We do not expect to reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until we have a sufficient historical trend of taxable income and can predict future taxable income with a higher degree of certainty.  
    
  Net loss 
           
  Net loss decreased   $3.5 million  , from   $49.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $45.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the decrease in operating loss, partially offset by the increase in other expense, as described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $58.9 million  , a decrease of   $25.7 million   from   $84.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Our future liquidity requirements will be influenced by numerous factors. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, anticipated funds from operations, and other sources of liquidity, which may include additional borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility described below under  Credit Facilities  or other credit or financing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our expected level of operations. 
    
  We may need or seek additional funding in the future. In addition to access to available borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility, we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue, from time to time, up to $200 million of senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, common stock, preferred stock and other securities. Our ability to issue debt securities is limited by certain covenants in the Credit Agreements described below under  Credit Facilities.  A financing transaction may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and a financing transaction may be dilutive to our current stockholders. 
    
  We have generated and used cash as follows: 

Operating Activities.   For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash used in operating activities was   $20.2 million  .  This compared with cash used in operating activities of   $42.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary sources and uses of cash during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were:

  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

During the first   nine   months of 2016, our net loss of   $45.5 million   included approximately   $33.2 million   of net non-cash expenses, which consisted primarily of   $20.6 million   of depreciation and amortization and   $10.3 million   of stock-based compensation.  

During the third quarter of 2016, we made a $5.0 million contingent consideration payment in connection with the AngioScore acquisition, $2.3 million of which was recognized in earnings subsequent to the AngioScore acquisition and contributed to net cash used in operating activities. See    Future Investments and Contingent Consideration Related to Acquisitions    below for more information on contingent consideration payments. 

During the first   nine   months of 2016, cash used as a result of the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately   $5.6 million   was primarily due to an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of approximately   $7.5 million   as a result of placement activity of our laser systems through our rental and evaluation programs, an increase in inventories of approximately   $2.5 million  , primarily due to increased sales demand and higher disposables production, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately   $1.2 million  , primarily due to prepayments for annual corporate insurance premiums.  These uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately   $4.7 million  , primarily due to the timing of compensation-related accruals, and a decrease in accounts receivable of   $1.8 million  , due primarily to a decrease in our days sales outstanding. 
     The primary sources and uses of cash during the first   nine   months of 2015 were:  

During the first   nine   months of 2015, our net loss of   $49.0 million   included approximately   $13.5 million   of non-cash expenses, which consisted primarily of   $19.7 million   of depreciation and amortization,   $9.0 million   of stock-based compensation,   $2.5 million   of contingent consideration expense and   $2.5 million   of intangible asset impairment, partially offset by a   $22.1 million   change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. 

During the first   nine   months of 2015, cash used as a result of the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately   $7.3 million   was primarily due to an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of   $10.0 million   as a result of placement activity of our laser systems through our rental and evaluation program, an increase in inventory of approximately   $1.7 million  , primarily due to increased sales demand and higher disposables and laser production, and an increase in other assets of approximately   $0.7 million  . These uses of cash during the first   nine   months of 2015 were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of   $2.6 million  , primarily due to the timing of vendor payments, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of   $2.1 million  , primarily due to the collection of escrow payments related to legal fees advanced and a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately   $0.7 million  , primarily due to a slight decrease in days sales outstanding. 
     Investing Activities.   For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash used in investing activities was   $3.9 million  , consisting entirely of capital expenditures. This compared with cash used in investing activities of   $38.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , consisting of   $30.0 million   of payments for the acquisition of Stellarex and   $8.3 million   of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 included manufacturing equipment upgrades and replacements, additional capital items for research and development projects, and additional computer equipment and software purchases, including capital items required for the Stellarex product line. 
    
  Financing Activities.   Cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 million  , consisting primarily of repayments on the line of credit, net, of   $2.9 million   and the $2.7 million portion of the $5.0 million contingent consideration payment in connection with the AngioScore acquisition related to the portion of the liability included as part of the initial measurement of fair value.  See    Future Investments and Contingent Consideration Related to Acquisitions    below for more information on contingent consideration payments.  These uses of cash were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of   $4.1 million  . In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , cash provided by financing activities was   $27.5 million  , consisting primarily of borrowings on the line of credit, net, of   $23.1 million   and the exercise of stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of   $4.5 million  .

The table below presents the change in receivables and inventory, in relative terms, through the presentation of financial ratios. Days sales outstanding are calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance, net of allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts, by the average daily sales for the quarter. The decrease in days sales outstanding for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to increased collections from slower-paying customers. Inventory turns are calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the quarter by ending inventory. 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had no significant capital lease obligations. 
    
  Future Investments and Contingent Consideration Related to Acquisitions 
    
  On January 27, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Stellarex DCB assets and made a cash payment of $30 million. In addition, as planned, the Stellarex acquisition requires substantial additional investments prior to full commercialization, primarily within research, development and clinical trials.  
    
  In connection with the AngioScore acquisition, we agreed to pay additional contingent merger consideration, a portion of which included a cash payment of $5.0 million if the AngioSculptX product received European CE mark approval by December 31, 2016. We received the European CE mark approval during the third quarter of 2016 and made a contingent consideration payment of $5.0 million, $2.7 million of which was classified as a cash flow from financing activities, because it was included as part of the initial measurement of the fair value of the consideration transferred.  The remaining $2.3 million of the payment was classified as a cash flow from operating activities, as it was reflected in earnings in the periods subsequent to the acquisition as accretion expense and a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not expect to make any additional contingent consideration payments related to the AngioScore acquisition. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  On December 7, 2015, the Company and AngioScore Inc., as borrowers (jointly, the  Borrowers ) entered into a term credit and security agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ) and a revolving credit and security agreement (the  Revolving Loan Credit Agreement , and together with the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the  Credit Agreements ) with MidCap Financial Trust and the other lenders party thereto.  The Credit Agreements replaced the Credit and Security Agreement (the  Wells Fargo Credit Agreement ) entered into by the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association on February 25, 2011. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $60 million term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $50 million revolving loan facility (the  Revolving Loan Facility ). The Revolving Loan Facility may be increased to up to $70 million, subject to lender approval. The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreements are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers. For more information, see Note 4,  Debt,  of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Loan Facility had outstanding balances of   $60.0 million   and   $21.3 million  , respectively. The borrowing base on the Revolving Loan Facility was   $36.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , based on the Company s accounts receivable and inventory balances. We may prepay and re-borrow amounts borrowed under the Revolving Loan Facility without penalty. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was   8.02%  , and the weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Loan Facility was   4.97%  . 
    
  Convertible Senior Notes 
    
  In June 2014, we sold $230 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2034 (the  Notes ). Net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used for the AngioScore acquisition. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.625%  

34 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

per annum. We pay interest on the Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2034 ( maturity date ), unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 
    
  Holders may convert their Notes into shares of our common stock at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
    
  The initial conversion rate is 31.9020 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $31.35 per share of our common stock). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs or we deliver a redemption notice, in certain circumstances we will increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Note in connection with such fundamental change or redemption notice, as the case may be. 
    
  Holders may require us to repurchase some or all of their Notes for cash on each of June 5, 2021, June 5, 2024 and June 5, 2029 and upon a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. 
    
  We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 5, 2018. On or after June 5, 2018 and prior to June 5, 2021, we may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date we provide the notice of redemption exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price for the Notes. On or after June 5, 2021, we may redeem any or all of the Notes in cash. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed as described in the two immediately preceding sentences equals 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
    
  The Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with any of our other senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Notes. The Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries  creditors, including trade creditors. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
           
  We maintain no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or that are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We maintain operating leases for our offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Broomfield, Colorado; Fremont, California; Maple Grove, Minnesota; the Netherlands, Germany and France.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures in this report. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in the tables below. An explanation of the manner in which our management uses these non-GAAP measures to conduct and evaluate our business and the reasons management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors are provided following the reconciliation tables.

           1) 
    Acquisition transaction, integration and other costs relate to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions, which closed on June 30, 2014 and January 27, 2015, respectively, and included investment banking fees, accounting, consulting, and legal fees, severance and retention costs, and non-recurring costs associated with establishing manufacturing operations to support the Stellarex program.  In addition, these costs included $0.8 million and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   for legal fees, including legal fees associated with the patent and breach of fiduciary duty matters. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, these costs included $2.5 million and $18.9 million for legal fees, including legal fees associated with the patent and breach of fiduciary duty matters, and costs advanced associated with the breach of fiduciary duty matter.  
       
           2) 
    Acquisition-related intangible asset amortization relates primarily to intangible assets acquired in the AngioScore acquisition in June 2014 and the Stellarex acquisition in January 2015. 
       
           3) 
    Contingent consideration expense primarily represents the accretion of the estimated contingent consideration liability related to future amounts payable to former AngioScore stockholders, based on sales of the AngioScore products and achievement of regulatory milestones. 
       
           4) 
    During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we remeasured the contingent consideration liability related to the AngioScore regulatory milestones to its fair value and reduced it by approximately $4.3 million. The intangible asset impairment of $2.5 million was to record a partial impairment of the in-process research and development intangible assets acquired as part of the AngioScore acquisition. 
       
  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we remeasured the contingent consideration liability related to the future AngioScore revenue-related payments to its fair value and reduced it by approximately $17.8 million. This reduction was the result of a decrease in our revenue estimates for the AngioSculpt products. 
    
           5) 
    Per share amounts may not add due to rounding. 
       
  Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to analyze the underlying trends in our business, assess the performance of our core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources and evaluate our performance period over period on a comparable basis and in relation to our competitors  operating results. In general, the income or expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance the comparability of results between periods and are non-cash costs or non-recurring costs. 
    
  The impact of foreign exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. We use a constant currency basis to show the impact from foreign exchange rates on current period revenue compared to prior period revenue using the prior period s foreign exchange rates. In order to properly understand the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations, we believe that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from our revenue. 

38 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Cont d) 

We believe that presenting the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results  through the eyes  of management. We also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.  
    
  Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some limitations associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures are provided below: 

Management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures used. 

Amortization expense, while not requiring cash settlement, is an ongoing and recurring expense, has a material impact on GAAP net loss, and reflects an economic cost to us not reflected in non-GAAP net loss.  

Items such as the acquisition transaction and integration costs and contingent consideration expense, excluded from non-GAAP net loss, can have a material impact on cash flows and GAAP net loss and reflect economic costs to us not reflected in non-GAAP net loss. 

Revenue growth rates stated on a constant currency basis, by their nature, exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may have a material impact on GAAP revenue. 

Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We must make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation allowances and reserves for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets, stock-based compensation expense, estimated clinical trial expenses, accrued estimates for incurred but not reported claims under partially self-insured employee health benefit programs, contingent consideration liabilities, and loss contingencies, including those related to litigation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
    
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Item 3.           Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and our exposure to foreign currency risk is primarily related to sales of our products in Europe, which are denominated primarily in the euro and translated into U.S. dollars.  Changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar could positively or adversely affect our revenue and net loss.  In addition, we record

foreign currency transaction gains and losses, included in other expense in our condensed consolidated financial statements, which result from intercompany transactions with our Dutch subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro. 
    
  Exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets.  Currently, we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and, as a result, we could incur gains or losses.  The fluctuation in currency rates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , caused a decrease of approximately   $0.3 million   in consolidated revenue and an increase in consolidated net loss of   $0.2 million  .  
    
  Based on our overall foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of   September 30, 2016  , a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar would have had a positive or negative impact on our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of approximately   $2.1 million    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our Revolving Loan Facility and our Term Loan Facility.  A 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates underlying our Revolving Loan Facility and Term Loan Facility would have the effect of increasing or decreasing our cash interest expense by approximately $0.8 million for an annual period on the   $21.3 million   and   $60.0 million   balances outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   under our Revolving Loan Facility and Term Loan Facility, respectively.  The Notes are at fixed rates, and therefore are not subject to market risk. 

Item 4.         Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
