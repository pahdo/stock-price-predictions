  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Organization
    Seagate Technology plc (the  Company ) is a leading provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions. Our
principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products including solid state hybrid drives ( SSHD ), solid state
drives ( SSD ), PCIe cards and SATA controllers. Our storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems, and high performance computing ( HPC ) solutions.  
 Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be
the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to
store data, and most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory. In addition to HDDs and SSDs, SSHDs combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed
data.    The Company s products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems;
client compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and client non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders
( DVRs ), personal data backup systems, portable external storage systems, digital media systems and surveillance systems.    The
Company s Cloud Systems and Solutions builds on the Seagate legacy to extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud. Our portfolio includes HPC storage solutions, modular original equipment
manufacturers ( OEM ) storage systems and scale-out storage systems.     Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its condensed consolidated financial
statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash
flows and shareholders  equity for the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.    The Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2016, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on August 5, 2016. The Company believes that the
disclosures included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, when read in conjunction with its Consolidated Financial Statements as of July 1, 2016, and the notes thereto, are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading.    The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period in the Company s fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to
June 30. Both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended October 2, 2015 consisted of 13 weeks. Fiscal year 2017 will be comprised of 52 weeks and will end on June 30, 2017. The fiscal quarters ended
September 30, 2016, July 1, 2016, and October 2, 2015, are also referred to herein as the  September 2016 quarter , the  June 2016 quarter , and the  September 2015 quarter , respectively.

   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
 There have been no significant changes in the Company s significant accounting policies. Please refer to Note 1 of  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data  contained in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2016, as filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016 for a discussion of
the Company s other significant accounting policies.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016 and May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09
(ASC Topic 606) , Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date,  ASU 2016-10 (ASC Topic 606)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  respectively. ASC Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and
qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amendments in these ASUs are effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This standard may be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or
retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption ( modified retrospective transition approach ). The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its condensed consolidated
financial statements and plans to adopt the modified retrospective transition approach.    In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 (ASC
Topic 330),  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The amendments in this ASU require inventory measurement at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted by all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is in the process of assessing the
impact, if any, of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASC
Subtopic 825-10),  Financial Instruments Overall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with
changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception
to fair value measurement. Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial
liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU. The Company is in
the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its condensed consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02 (ASC Topic 842),  Leases . The ASU amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and
corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 (ASC Topic 718 ), Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The amendments in this ASU are intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation
arrangements, including the income tax consequences, classification on the consolidated statement of cash flows and treatment of forfeitures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 (ASC Topic 230 ), Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments.  The amendments in this ASU are intended to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payment are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   
   In April 2015 and August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 (ASC Subtopic 835-30),  Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and ASU 2015-15 (ASC Subtopic 835-30),  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements- Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to
  
      9  

Table of Contents  

Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,  respectively. The ASUs require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability, with the exception of those related to
line-of-credit arrangements, be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2016 quarter on a retrospective basis.
The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reduction to Other assets, net and Long-term debt by 38 million and 39 million, within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of July 1, 2016, respectively. ASU 2015-15 became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2016 quarter on a prospective basis with no material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and
disclosures.      In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 (ASC Topic 805),  Business Combinations Simplifying the Accounting
for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The income effects of such measurement period adjustments
are to be recorded in the same period s financial statements but calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The impact of measurement period adjustments to earnings that relate to prior period financial
statements are to be presented separately on the income statement or disclosed by line item. The amendments in this update are for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. This ASU
became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2016 quarter on a prospective basis with no material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

    Short-Term Borrowings   
 The credit agreement entered into by the Company and its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman on January 18, 2011 and subsequently amended (the
 Revolving Credit Facility ) provides the Company with a $700 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term of the Revolving Credit Facility is through January 15, 2020, provided that if the Company does not have
Investment Grade Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) on August 15, 2018, then the maturity date will be August 16, 2018 unless certain extension conditions have been satisfied. The loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company. The Company and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the Revolving
Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to compliance with certain covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing, and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub-limit of $75 million.
   The Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, includes three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. On April 27, 2016, the Revolving Credit Agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to allow for higher net leverage levels.
The Company was in compliance with the modified covenants as of September 30, 2016 and expects to be in compliance for the next 12 months.  
 As of September 30, 2016, no borrowings had been drawn or letters of credit utilized under the Revolving Credit Facility.

  Income Taxes       The Company s income tax provision of $6 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 included approximately $5 million of net discrete tax benefits, primarily associated with the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and prior year tax adjustments.  
 The Company s income tax provision recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differed from the provision for income
taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays
or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased
by approximately $2 million to $68 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $68 million at September 30, 2016, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the 12
months beginning October 1, 2016, the Company expects that its unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $11 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
 The Company s income tax benefit of $3 million in the three months ended October 2, 2015 included approximately $4 million of net
discrete tax benefits, primarily associated with the release of tax reserves associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
 The Company s income tax benefit recorded for the three months ended October 2, 2015 differed from the benefit from income taxes
that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax
incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain U.S. deferred tax assets.

  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        Goodwill   
 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are as follows:  
   
    Other Intangible Assets   
 Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology, customer relationships, in-process research and development
( IPR D ) and trade names acquired in business combinations. With the exception of IPR D, acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization is charged
to Operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. IPR D has been determined to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the carrying amount of IPR D exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. There were no impairment charges recognized for IPR D. Upon
completion of the IPR D, the related assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset, and will be amortized over its useful life.

  The carrying value of other intangible assets subject to amortization as of September 30,
2016, is set forth in the following table:     
   The carrying value of IPR D not subject to amortization was $14 million as of September 30,

   The carrying value of IPR D not subject to amortization was 14 million on July 1, 2016.
   The amortization expense of other intangible assets was $42 million and $41 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and October 2, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, expected amortization expense for other intangible assets for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:

8.  
  Derivative Financial Instruments       The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange
rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity price risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted
expenses denominated in foreign currencies and to mitigate the remeasurement risk of certain foreign currency denominated liabilities. The Company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified
as designated or non-designated hedging instruments. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the effective portions of designated cash flow hedges are recorded
in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The
amounts of net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges were $2 million and $2 million, respectively as of September 30, 2016 and July 1, 2016.  
 The Company dedesignates its cash flow hedges when the forecasted hedged transactions are realized or it is probable the forecasted hedged
transactions will not occur in the initially identified time period. At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair
value of such derivative instruments are immediately reflected in earnings. The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s existing foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months. The deferred amount currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be
recognized into earnings over the next 12 months is immaterial.    The following tables show the total notional value of the Company s
outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of September 30, 2016 and July 1, 2016:

   The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments
selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan the Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the  SDCP ).

Table of Contents  

In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap ( TRS ) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. The Company pays a floating
rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. As of
September 30, 2016, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $99 million. The original contract term of the TRS was through January 2016, and was settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk. The
Company renewed the contract term through January 2017 under materially the same terms. The Company did not designate the TRS as a hedge. Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value
changes of the SDCP liabilities.    The following tables show the Company s derivative instruments measured at fair value as reflected
in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and July 1, 2016:

  Fair Value        Measurement of Fair Value   
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would
transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.     Fair Value Hierarchy
    A fair value hierarchy is based on whether the market participant assumptions used in determining fair value are obtained from
independent sources (observable inputs) or reflects the Company s own assumptions of market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:    Level 1
  Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  
      19  

Table of Contents  

  Level 2   Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive;
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; or  
 Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  
 The Company considers an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume
to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and views an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among
market makers. Where appropriate the Company s or the counterparty s non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.  
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   
 The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities, by financial instrument type and balance sheet line item that are

The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices
are available in an active market.    The Company classifies items in Level 2 if the financial asset or liability is valued using observable
inputs. The Company uses observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets include: agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal bonds, U.S. Treasuries and certificates of
deposits. These debt investments are priced using observable inputs and valuation models which vary by asset class. The Company uses a pricing service to assist in determining the fair values of all of its cash equivalents and short-term
investments. For the cash equivalents and short-term investments in the Company s portfolio, multiple pricing sources are generally available. The pricing service uses inputs from multiple industry standard data providers or other third party
sources and various methodologies, such as weighting and models, to determine the appropriate price at the measurement date. The Company corroborates the prices obtained from the pricing service against other independent sources and, as of
September 30, 2016, has not found it necessary to make any adjustments to the prices obtained. The Company s derivative financial instruments are also classified within Level 2. The Company s derivative financial
 
      21  

Table of Contents  

instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the TRS. The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value. The
Company determines the fair value of these instruments by considering the estimated amount it would pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and July 1, 2016, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis.     Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis   
 The Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. Strategic investments in equity
securities where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees, included in Other assets, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are recorded at cost and are periodically analyzed to determine
whether or not there are indicators of impairment. The carrying value of the Company s strategic investments at September 30, 2016 and July 1, 2016 totaled $114 million and $113 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of
privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.    For the three months ended October 2, 2015, the Company
determined that a certain equity investment accounted for under the cost method was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recognized a charge of $10 million in order to write down the carrying amount of the investments to zero. This amount was
recorded in Other, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company did not record any impairment charges in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Other Fair Value Disclosures   
 The Company s debt is carried at amortized cost. The fair value of the Company s debt is derived using the closing price as of
the date of valuation, which takes into account the yield curve, interest rates, and other observable inputs. Accordingly, these fair value measurements are categorized as Level 2. The following table presents the fair value and amortized cost
of the Company s debt in order of maturity:      
     
    Share Capital   
 The Company s authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.00001, of which 298,607,364
shares were outstanding as of September 30, 2016, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  
  Ordinary shares  Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Company s board of
directors (the  Board of Directors ). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to
holders of the preferred and ordinary shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.    
  Preferred shares  The Company may issue preferred shares in one or more series, up to the authorized amount, without shareholder
approval. The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its
qualifications,  
      22  

Table of Contents  

limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any
further vote or action by the shareholders.    The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting or
conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares. The issuance of preferred shares, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could,
among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and might harm the market price of its ordinary shares and the voting and other rights of the holders of ordinary shares.  
  Repurchases of Equity Securities   
 On April 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of its outstanding ordinary
shares.    All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Company s Articles of Association.  
 As of September 30, 2016, $1.6 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.  
 The following table sets forth information with respect to repurchases of the Company s shares during the three months ended
September 30, 2016:

  Share-based Compensation       The Company recorded approximately $40 million and $33 million
share-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.      
    Indemnifications to Officers and Directors   
 On May 4, 2009, Seagate Technology, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands
( Seagate-Cayman ), then the parent company, entered into a new form of indemnification agreement (the  Revised Indemnification Agreement ) with its officers and directors of Seagate-Cayman and its subsidiaries (each, an
 Indemnitee ). The Revised Indemnification Agreement provides indemnification in addition to any of Indemnitee s indemnification rights under Seagate-Cayman s Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, and indemnifies
an Indemnitee for certain expenses (including attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of Seagate-Cayman or any
of its subsidiaries, arising out of his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries or of any other entity to which he or she provides services at Seagate-Cayman s request. However, an
Indemnitee shall not be indemnified under the Revised Indemnification Agreement for (i) any fraud or dishonesty in the performance of Indemnitee s duty to Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman or
(ii) Indemnitee s conscious, intentional or willful failure to act honestly, lawfully and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman. In addition, the Revised
Indemnification Agreement provides that Seagate-Cayman will advance expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with enforcement of the Revised Indemnification Agreement or with the investigation, settlement or appeal of any action or
proceeding against him or her as to which he or she could be indemnified.    On July 3, 2010, pursuant to a corporate reorganization,
the common shareholders of Seagate-Cayman became ordinary shareholders of Seagate Technology plc (the  Company ) and Seagate-Cayman became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as described more fully in the Current Report on Form 8-K
filed by the Company on July 6, 2010 (the  Redomestication ). On July 27, 2010, in connection with the Redomestication, the Company, as sole shareholder of Seagate-Cayman, approved a form of deed of indemnity (the  Deed of
Indemnity ), which provides for the indemnification by Seagate-Cayman of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, Seagate-Cayman or any subsidiary of the Company (each, a  Deed Indemnitee ), in addition to any of a
Deed Indemnitee s indemnification rights under the Company s Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, with a similar scope to the Revised Indemnification Agreement. Seagate-Cayman entered into the Deed of Indemnity with
certain Deed  
      23  

Table of Contents  

Indemnitees effective as of July 3, 2010 and continues to enter into the Deed of Indemnity with additional Deed Indemnitees from time to time.  
 The nature of these indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it
could be required to pay on behalf of its officers and directors. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.     Intellectual Property Indemnification Obligations   
 The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations
that are customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions. The
nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically, the Company has not made
any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.  
  Product Warranty     The
Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of 1 to 5 years. The Company uses estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical modeling to
estimate product return rates in order to determine its warranty obligation. Changes in the Company s product warranty liability during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 were as follows:  

24  

Table of Contents  

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period and the
number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding options, unvested restricted share units and shares to be purchased under the
ESPP. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in fair market value of the Company s share price
can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to the shareholders of Seagate Technology plc:  
   
   The anti-dilutive shares related to employee equity award plans that were excluded from the computation of
diluted net income (loss) were 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and immaterial for the three months ended October 2, 2015.      

14.  
  Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies       The Company assesses the probability of an
unfavorable outcome of all its material litigation, claims, or assessments to determine whether a liability had been incurred and whether it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. In the event that an
unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company establishes an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. In addition, in the event an unfavorable outcome is determined to be
less than probable, but reasonably possible, the Company will disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of such loss; however, when a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. Litigation is
inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially.     Intellectual Property Litigation   
  Convolve, Inc. ( Convolve ) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et
al.  On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
No. 4,916,635 (the   635 patent ) and U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 (the   267 patent ), misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and other claims. In the complaint, the plaintiffs requested
injunctive relief, $800 million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages, including for willful infringement. On January 16, 2002, Convolve filed an amended complaint, alleging defendants infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473
(the   473 patent ). The district court ruled in 2010 that the  267 patent was out of the case.      On
August 16, 2011, the district court granted in part and denied in part the Company s motion for summary judgment. On July 1, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: 1) affirmed the district court s summary
judgment rulings that Seagate did not misappropriate any of the alleged trade secrets and that the asserted claims of the  635 patent are invalid; 2) reversed and vacated the district court s summary judgment of non-infringement with
respect to the  473 patent; and 3) remanded the case for further proceedings on the  473 patent. On July 11, 2014, the district court granted the Company s summary judgment motion regarding Convolve s only remaining
cause of action, which alleged infringement of the  473 patent. The district court entered judgment in favor of the Company on July 14, 2014. Convolve filed a notice of appeal on August 13, 2014. On February 10, 2016, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: 1) affirmed the district court s summary judgment of no direct infringement by Seagate because Seagate s ATA/SCSI  
      25  

Table of Contents  

disk drives do not meet the  user interface  limitation of the asserted claims of the  473 patent; 2) affirmed the district court s summary judgment of non-infringement by
Compaq s products as to claims 1, 3, and 5 of the  473 patent because Compaq s F10 BIOS interface does not meet the  commands  limitation of those claims; 3) vacated the district court s summary judgment of
non-infringement by Compaq s accused products as to claims 7-15 of the  473 patent; 4) reversed the district court s summary judgment of non-infringement based on intervening rights; and 5) remanded the case to the district court for
further proceedings on the  473 patent. In view of the rulings made by the district court and the Court of Appeals and the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded Convolve in this matter, the Company does not
believe that it is currently possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter.  
  Alexander Shukh v. Seagate Technology  On February 12, 2010, Alexander Shukh filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging, among other things, employment discrimination based on his Belarusian national origin and wrongful failure to name him as an inventor on several patents and patent applications.
Mr. Shukh s employment was terminated as part of a company-wide reduction in force in fiscal year 2009. He seeks damages in excess of $75 million. On March 31, 2014, the district court granted Seagate s summary judgment motion
and entered judgment in favor of Seagate. Mr. Shukh filed a notice of appeal on April 7, 2014. On October 2, 2015, the court of appeals vacated and remanded the district court s grant of summary judgment on Mr. Shukh s
claim for correction of inventorship and affirmed the district court s grant of summary judgment as to all other claims. On October 29, 2015, Mr. Shukh filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the court of appeals; the petition was
denied on December 17, 2015. On March 16, 2016, Shukh filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court; the petition was denied on June 27, 2016. In view of the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any,
that could be awarded in this matter, the Company does not believe that it is currently possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter.    
  Enova Technology Corporation v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al.  On June 5, 2013, Enova Technology Corporation
( Enova ) filed a complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,136,995 (the
  995 patent ),  Cryptographic Device,  and U.S. Patent No. 7,900,057 (the   057 patent ),  Cryptographic Serial ATA Apparatus and Method.  The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory
damages, enhanced damages, injunctive relief, attorneys  fees, and other relief. On April 27, 2015, the district court ordered a stay of the case, in view of proceedings regarding the  995 and  057 patents before the Patent
Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case. On September 2, 2015, PTAB issued its final written decision that
claims 1-15 of the  995 patent are held unpatentable. On December 18, 2015, PTAB issued its final written decisions that claims 1-32 and 40-53 of the  057 patent are held unpatentable. On February 4, 2016, PTAB issued
its final written decision that claims 33-39 of the  057 patent are held unpatentable. Enova has appealed PTAB s decisions on the  995 patent and the  057 patent to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. A hearing before the court of appeals has not yet been scheduled. In view of the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded in this matter, the Company does not believe that it is currently possible to
determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter.       Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC v.
Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al.  On April 29, 2016, Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC filed a complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,128,988,  Magnetic Material Structures, Devices and Methods.  The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, enhanced damages, injunctive relief,
attorneys  fees, and other relief. The Company believes the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case. In view of the uncertainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded
in this matter, the Company does not believe that it is currently possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the possible range of loss related to this matter.    
  Environmental Matters   
 The Company s operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including
those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of the Company s operations require environmental permits and controls
to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.  
 The Company has established environmental management systems and continually updates its environmental policies and standard operating
procedures for its operations worldwide. The Company believes that its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. The Company budgets for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to
comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on the Company in the future, it could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures.  
      26  

Table of Contents  

  Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the  Superfund  law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste
to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at
several sites. At each of these sites, the Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. The
Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.    While the
Company s ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on its current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs, the Company does not expect costs in connection
with these sites to be material.    The Company may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing
the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union ( EU ) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment, which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives and server storage products, put on the market after July 1, 2006. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other
jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, China, Japan and others. The European Union REACH Directive (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, EC 1907/2006) also restricts substances of
very high concern ( SVHCs ) in products. If the Company or its suppliers fails to comply with the substance restrictions, recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially
adverse effect on the Company s business.     Other Matters   
 The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business, and the Company may be
involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

solid state hybrid drives ( SSHD ) and solid state drives ( SSD ) in our Enterprise market portfolio. Our storage technology portfolio also includes storage subsystems, and high performance computing ( HPC ) solutions.
   Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to
be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to
store data, and most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory. In addition to HDDs and SSDs, SSHDs combine the features of SSDs  
      28

and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.  
 Our products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; client compute
applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and client non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, personal
data backup systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders ( DVRs ) and gaming consoles.    Our Cloud Systems and
Solutions build on the Seagate legacy to extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure, onsite and in the cloud. Our portfolio includes HPC storage solutions, modular original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) storage
systems and scale-out storage systems.     Overview of the September 2016 Quarter   
 During the September 2016 quarter, we shipped 39 million drive units totaling 67 exabytes of storage capacity, generating revenue of
approximately $2.8 billion and gross margin of 29%. Our operating cash flow was $592 million. We paid $101 million for repurchases of ordinary shares.  
  Results of Operations     We list in the
tables below summarized information from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue:

   Revenue   
 The following table summarizes information regarding average drive selling prices ( ASPs ), drive volume unit shipments, exabytes
shipped, and revenues by channel and geography:      

(1) 
 For the periods presented, gaming units in Client Compute have been reclassified to Client Non-Compute to better align with current market trends.    
 Revenue in the September 2016 quarter increased by $143 million from the June 2016 quarter as a result of favorable product mix and an
increase in unit shipments driven primarily by better demand for the Company s high capacity enterprise HDD product portfolio. Compared to the September 2015 quarter, revenue decreased by $128 million as a result of a decrease in unit shipments
and price erosion, partially offset by improved product mix.    We maintain various sales programs such as channel rebates and price
masking. Price masking rebates are primarily a function of OEM enterprise revenue and contributed to a higher proportion of the sales programs as a percentage of revenue in the September 2016 quarter. Sales programs were at the low range of its
historical range at 10%, 11% and 13% of gross drive revenue for the September 2016 quarter, June 2016 quarter and September 2015 quarter, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues
reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1.0% of quarterly gross revenue in the September 2016 quarter.     Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin
      
   Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the September 2016 quarter increased by approximately 400 basis
points compared to the June 2016 quarter driven by favorable product mix and improved utilization of factories resulting from cost savings due to our ongoing workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities.  
 Compared to the September 2015 quarter, gross margin in the September 2016 quarter increased by approximately 500 basis points, as a result of
favorable product mix and improved utilization of factories resulting from cost savings due to our ongoing workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities, partially offset by price erosion.  
      30

  In the September 2016 quarter, total warranty cost was in the historical range of 1% to 5% of
revenue and included an unfavorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of less than 0.5% of revenue. Warranty cost related to new unit shipments was 1.1% of revenue for each of the September 2016, June 2016 and September 2015
quarters, respectively.     Operating Expenses       
    Product development expense.  Product development expense for the September 2016 quarter increased
by $8 million from the June 2016 quarter due to a $19 million increase in variable compensation and share-based compensation driven by better financial performance, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in salaries as a result of the
restructuring of our workforce in the June 2016 and September 2016 quarters, and increased operational efficiencies in our business. Compared to the September 2015 quarter, product development expense decreased by $13 million due to a $24 million
decrease in salaries and other employee benefits as a result of our ongoing restructuring actions to reduce our global workforce. The decrease was partially offset by a $22 million increase in variable compensation in the September 2016 quarter with
the remainder of the decrease due to increased operational efficiencies in our business.       Marketing and administrative
expense.  Marketing and administrative expense for the September 2016 quarter increased by $12 million from the June 2016 quarter mainly due to a $17 million increase in variable compensation and share-based compensation driven by better
financial performance, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in salaries and other employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in the June 2016 and September 2016 quarters. Compared to the September 2015 quarter,
marketing and administrative expense decreased by $27 million due to a $25 million decrease in salaries and other employee benefits as a result of our ongoing restructuring actions to reduce global workforce, a $6 million reduction in advertising
and marketing expenses in the September 2016 quarter. The decrease was partially offset by a $13 million increase in variable compensation and share-based compensation driven by better financial performance in the September 2016 quarter, with the
remainder of the decrease due to increased operational efficiencies in our business.       Amortization of
intangibles.  Amortization of intangibles for the September 2016 quarter remained flat from June 2016 quarter. Compared to the September 2015 quarter, amortization of intangibles decreased by $6 million, due to certain intangible assets
reaching the end of their useful life, partially offset by the intangibles acquired in the acquisition of Dot Hill during the quarter ended January 1, 2016.    
  Restructuring and other, net.  Restructuring and other, net for the September 2016, June 2016 and September 2015 quarters was
comprised primarily of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by approximately 6,500, 1,600 and 1,000 employees in each of those quarters, respectively, as we continue to consolidate our global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the
Americas. See  Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 7. Restructuring and Exit Costs  for more details.     
  Other (Expense) Income, Net       
   Other (expense) income, net remained flat from the June 2016 quarter. Compared to the September 2015 quarter,
other (expense) income, net decreased by $7 million due to a $10 million loss related to the impairment of a strategic investment in the September 2015 quarter, partially offset by a higher interest expense capitalization in the September 2015
quarter.  
      31  

Table of Contents  

   Income Taxes       
   Our income tax provision of $6 million for the September 2016 quarter included approximately $5 million of net
discrete tax benefits, primarily associated with the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and prior year tax adjustments.  
 Our income tax provision recorded for the September 2016 quarter differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by
applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and
are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by
approximately $2 million to $68 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $68 million at September 30, 2016, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the 12
months beginning October 1, 2016, we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $11 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
 Our income tax benefit recorded for the September 2015 quarter included approximately $4 million of net discrete tax benefits, primarily
associated with the release of tax reserves associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.    Our income tax benefit
recorded for the September 2015 quarter differed from the benefit from income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to
non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain U.S. deferred tax
assets.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital
resources. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of money market funds, and certificates of deposits. The
principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We operate in some countries that have restrictive
regulations over the movement of cash and/or foreign exchange across their borders. However, we believe our sources of cash have been and will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months unimpeded by any
restrictive regulations. We are not aware of any downgrades, losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short-term investments and we do not believe the fair value of our short-term investments has
significantly changed from the values reported as of September 30, 2016.     Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   
   
   Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased from July 1, 2016 as a result of an
increase in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by net cash outflows for repurchase of our ordinary shares.  
      32  

Table of Contents  

   Cash Provided by Operating Activities   
 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $592 million includes the effects of net income
adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and:      

an increase of $101 million in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments on material purchases and an increase in units built    
  Cash Used in Investing Activities   
 Cash used for investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $139 million and primarily attributable to the
following activities:      

$140 million used to acquire property, equipment and leasehold improvements       Cash Used in
Financing Activities     Cash used in financing activities of $89 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
attributable to the following activities:      

$101 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares; and        

$23 million paid for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; offset by        

$35 million in proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans        Liquidity Sources,
Cash Requirements and Commitments      Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2016 consisted of:
(1) approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations and (3) a $700 million senior revolving credit facility.  
 As of September 30, 2016, no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit
issued under this credit facility. The line of credit is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.  
 The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility, as amended, includes three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. On April 28, 2016, the Revolving Credit Agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to adjust for
our current financial liquidity position. We were in compliance with the modified covenants as of September 30, 2016 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months.  
 Our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled
payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to
prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control .     For
fiscal year 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be less than 5% of revenue.    From time to time we may repurchase any of our
outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, or may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.  
 Dividends declared in the September 2016 quarter of $188 million were subsequently paid on October 5, 2016. The Company s Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on October 19, 2016, which is payable on January 4, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 21, 2016.  
 From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private, open market, or broker assisted purchases. As of
September 30, 2016, $1.6 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit. All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Company s Articles of Association.  
  Critical Accounting Policies     Our
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of
such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our
estimates are  
      33  

Table of Contents  

based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results may vary from our estimates.  
 Since our fiscal year ended July 1, 2016, there have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and
estimates. Refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1,
2016, as filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.     Recent Accounting
Pronouncements     See  Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies  for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.      

ITEM 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We have exposure to market
risks due to the volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity, and bond markets. A portion of these risks are hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally,
we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes.  
  Interest Rate Risk . Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. As of
September 30, 2016, we had no material available-for-sale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. We determined no available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily
impaired as of September 30, 2016. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.      We
have fixed rate debt obligations. We enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs.  
 The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and
debt obligations as of September 30, 2016.     Fiscal Years Ended   
   
    Foreign Currency Exchange Risk . We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage
exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As this time, we
have not identified any material exposure associated with the changes as a result of the British vote to exit the European Union.    
 We also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce
the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and
liabilities. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging.  All these foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.  
      34  

Table of Contents  

  We evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective
portion of the hedging instruments in Cost of revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We did not have any material net gains (losses) recognized in Cost of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or
discontinued cash flow hedges during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    The table below provides information as of
September 30, 2016 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The table is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign
currency exchange rates.

 Equivalent to the unrealized net (loss) gain on existing contracts.       Other Market
Risks . We have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio. We monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency
forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty, and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the
financial institution. Additionally, the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. As of September 30, 2016, we had no material credit exposure related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
Changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results, but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties.    
 We are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our
Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the  SDCP ). In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a Total Return Swap ( TRS ) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. We pay a floating rate, based on
LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. See
 Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8. Derivative Financial Instruments  of this Report on Form 10-Q.      

ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report. Based on the evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. During the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2.  
  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS        Repurchase of Equity Securities   
 All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Company s Articles of Association.  
 On April 22, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of its outstanding ordinary
shares.    As of September 30, 2016, $1.6 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.
There is no expiration date on this authorization.    The following table sets forth information with respect to all repurchases of our
shares made during fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016:
