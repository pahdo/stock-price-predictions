  Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (this "Form 10-Q") (including information incorporated by reference) includes "forward-looking statements" addressing expectations, prospects, estimates and other matters that are dependent upon future events or developments. Many forward-looking statements appear in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), but there are others in the document, which may be identified by the words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will," "should," "could," "would," "project," "continue," "likely," and similar expressions, and include statements reflecting future results, trends or guidance, statements of outlook and expense accruals. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. The most significant of these risks, uncertainties and other factors are described in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q and in "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (our  2016 Form 10-K ). Forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this document. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In the "Overview of Consolidated Results" section of MD A, we use financial measures that are derived from our consolidated financial data but are not presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the  Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section following MD A in this Form 10-Q.  

MD A 
    Overview 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The discussion and analysis presented below is concerned with material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the periods specified in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , and in our condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . All comparisons presented are with respect to the prior-year period, unless stated otherwise. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the MD A included in our   2016 Form 10-K  .  

MD A 
    Overview 

Overview of Consolidated Results 
  Revenue 

Revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $32.0 billion  , a   14 percent   increase, due primarily to sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers. 
  GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Earnings 

The sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , GAAP operating earnings decreased   14 percent   to   $535 million   and non-GAAP operating earnings decreased   9 percent   to   $669 million  . The decreases in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings were due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes, reduced levels of branded pharmaceutical inflation and the loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer. These were partially offset by other aspects of our Pharmaceutical segment generics program, which exclude the above-mentioned pricing changes.  

MD A 
    Overview 

GAAP and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS  

The sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. ("diluted EPS") decreased   17 percent   to   $0.96   per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased   10 percent   to   $1.24   per share. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased primarily due to the factors impacting GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings. 
    
  Cash and Equivalents 

Our cash and equivalents balance was   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.4 billion   at   June 30, 2016  . The decrease in cash and equivalents during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by   $250 million   paid for share repurchases,   $149 million   paid in dividends and   $100 million   in capital expenditures, offset in part by net cash provided by operating activities of   $104 million  . 
    
  Significant Developments  
  Acquisitions 

On October 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Cordis business from Ethicon, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson   Johnson, for $1.9 billion. The acquisition of Cordis, a global manufacturer and distributor of interventional cardiology devices and endovascular solutions with operations in more than 50 countries, expands our Medical segment's portfolio of self-manufactured products and its geographic scope. 
  Trends 

Within our Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect fiscal 2017 segment profit to be less than fiscal 2016 segment profit due to the factors described below under "Results of Operations" that impacted results in the three months ended September 30, 2016. However, as is generally the case, the frequency, timing, magnitude, and profit impact of pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remains uncertain and their impact on Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating  
  earnings in fiscal 2017 could be more or less than we expect. 

MD A 
    Results of Operations 

Results of Operations 
  Revenue 

Pharmaceutical Segment  
  Pharmaceutical segment revenue growth for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to $3.9 billion in sales growth from new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers, including the on-boarding of a new mail order customer. 

Medical Segment 
  Medical segment revenue growth for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to acquisitions, which contributed $194 million, and sales growth from new and existing customers. 

Cost of Products Sold 

Cost of products sold increased   $4.0 billion     (  15 percent  ) compared to the prior-year period, as a result of the same factors affecting the change in revenue and gross margin.  

MD A 
    Results of Operations 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was essentially flat versus the prior-year period. 
  Acquisitions and additional sales to new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers increased gross margin by $116 million and $109 million, respectively.  These were partially offset by the loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer.  

Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 67 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and changes in product mix resulting from the on-boarding of a new mail order customer. While the new mail order customer contributes positively to gross margin dollars it has a dilutive impact on our overall gross margin rate.  

Distribution, Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG A") Expenses 

The increase in SG A expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to the impact of acquisitions ($95 million). 

MD A 
    Results of Operations 

Segment Profit 

We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. See   Note 13   of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information on segment profit. 

Pharmaceutical Segment Profit 
  The decrease in Pharmaceutical segment profit during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was largely due to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes. Reduced levels of branded pharmaceutical inflation and the loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer beginning April 1, 2016 also contributed to the decrease in Pharmaceutical segment profit.  These were partially offset by other aspects of our generics program, which  

exclude the above-mentioned pricing changes. 
    
  Medical Segment Profit 
  The increase in Medical segment profit during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to acquisitions and contributions from   Cardinal Health Brand products. 

MD A 
    Results of Operations 

Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings 

In addition to revenue, gross margin, and SG A expenses discussed previously, consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following: 

Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs 
  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was   $101 million   and   $67 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Earnings Before Income Taxes 

In addition to the items discussed above, earnings before income taxes was impacted by the following: 

Provision for Income Taxes 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the effective tax rate was 37.3 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included net favorable discrete items of $28 million.  

MD A 
    Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We currently believe that, based on available capital resources (cash on hand and committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures; currently anticipated business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; tax payments; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends, and share repurchases. If we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital markets for additional financing. 
  Cash and Equivalents 

Our cash and equivalents balance was   $2.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.4 billion   at   June 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we deployed   $250 million   on share repurchases,   $149 million   for cash dividends and   $100 million   for capital expenditures; net cash provided by operating activities was   $104 million  , driven by net earnings and changes in working capital. 

The cash and equivalents balance at   September 30, 2016   included $622 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash is available for repatriation, bringing the cash into the United States could trigger U.S federal, state and local income tax obligations. 
  Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix. 

Other Financing Arrangements and Financial Instruments 

Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper 
  In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity include a   $1.75 billion   revolving credit facility and a   $700 million   committed receivables sales facility program. We also have a commercial paper program of up to   $1.5 billion  , backed by the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility; however, availability was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of   $14 million  . We also had no amounts outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program; however, availability was reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit of   $38 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  

Our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of   no more than 3.25-to-1   and our committed receivables sales facility also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio, as of the end of any calendar quarter, of   at least 4-to-1  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
  At both   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , we held   $200 million   of marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. 

Capital Deployment 

Capital Expenditures 
  Capital expenditures during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $100 million   and   $83 million  , respectively. 
  Dividends 
  On August 8, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of   $0.4489   per share, or   $1.80   per share on an annualized basis, payable on October 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 3, 2016. 

Share Repurchases 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   we repurchased   $250 million   of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with available cash. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $793 million   remaining under our existing share repurchase program. 

MD A 
    Other Items 

Other Items 
  The MD A in our 2016 Form 10-K addresses our contractual obligations, critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates, and  off-balance sheet arrangements, as of and for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . There have been no subsequent material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to those items. 

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The "Overview of Consolidated Results" section within MD A in this Form 10-Q contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  
  In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated. 
  Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The differences between the non-GAAP measures presented in this Form 10-Q and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are represented by the following items, which management believes are useful to exclude for its own and for investors  assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: 
             
    LIFO charges and credits  , which we began excluding in fiscal 2015 because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. We also believe that the exclusion of LIFO charges from non-GAAP metrics allows for a better comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies;  
                
    restructuring and employee severance costs  , which include charges for programs in which we fundamentally change our operations and are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business; 
                
    amortization and other acquisition-related costs  . We exclude amortization costs primarily for consistency with the presentation of the financial results of our peer group companies. Additionally, these non-cash amounts are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion allows for better comparison of forecasted, current and historical financial results. We exclude other acquisition-related costs because they are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. They are also significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions; 
                
    impairments and gains or loss on disposal of assets  , which are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and their exclusion results in a metric that more meaningfully reflects the sustainability of our operating performance;  
                
    litigation recoveries or charges, net  , which often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount; and 
                
    loss on extinguishment of debt  , which does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of these types of charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. 
     The tax effect for each of the non-GAAP items described above is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

Other 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures included in our   2016   Form 10-K since the end of fiscal   2016   through   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Implementation of New Software Systems 
  The Pharmaceutical segment is in a multi-year project implementing a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems, which is expected to affect internal control over financial reporting. This project did not impact internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Pharmaceutical segment plans to begin transitioning selected processes to the new systems later in fiscal 2017. If these new systems are not effectively implemented or fail to operate as intended, it could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Legal Proceedings 
  The legal proceedings described in   Note 7   of the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Legal Proceedings" section by reference. 

Other 

Risk Factors 
  You should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in "Risk Factors" and other risks discussed in our   2016 Form 10-K   and our filings with the SEC since   June 30, 2016  . These risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations. 
   
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

(1) 
    Reflects   177  ,   331   and   2,620   common shares purchased in July, August and September 2016, respectively, through a rabbi trust as investments of participants in our Deferred Compensation Plan. 
              (2) 
    On October 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program and on August 6, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion under the program, for a total of $2.0 billion. This program was completed in July 2016. On May 4, 2016, our Board of Directors also approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2019. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   3 million   common shares under these programs. After these repurchases, we have   $793 million   available under our new repurchase program.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Basis of Presentation 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated. References to "we," "our," and similar pronouns in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   (this "Form 10-Q") refer to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise.  
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") instructions to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and include the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial reporting. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. Except as disclosed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, all such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. In addition, financial results presented for this fiscal   2017   interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  . These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   (the "  2016 Form 10-K  ").  
  Recent Financial Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued accounting guidance which clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including those related to contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees, debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance that clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. If it is determined that a software license does not exist in the arrangement, the customer would account for this arrangement as a service contract. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter  

of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
  Also in April 2015, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. This guidance requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt rather than as an asset. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Upon adoption of this guidance, debt issuance costs of   $29 million   were reclassified from other assets to long-term obligations, less current portion within the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This guidance is based on the principle that revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This amendment will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are in the process of assessing any differences between the amended and existing guidance that could impact our consolidated financial statements and continuing to evaluate the options for adoption. 
   
  2. Acquisitions    
  Cordis 
  On   October 2, 2015  , we acquired the Cordis business from Ethicon, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson   Johnson, for   $1.9 billion   using cash on hand and proceeds from our debt offering in June   2015  . The acquisition of Cordis, a global manufacturer and distributor of interventional cardiology devices and endovascular solutions with operations in more than   50   countries, expands our Medical segment's portfolio of self-manufactured products and its geographic scope. We closed the Cordis acquisition in   20   principal countries on   October 2, 2015  , and acquired control of, as described in GAAP, and the rights to, the net economic benefit from the entire Cordis business in the remaining countries at that time.  
  Transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Cordis were   $14 million   and   $21 million   during the three months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in amortization and other acquisition-related costs in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.  
  Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 
  The allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions of Cordis, naviHealth Holdings, LLC. ("naviHealth"), and The Harvard Drug Group ("Harvard Drug") were finalized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in goodwill of   $943 million  ,   $334 million  , and   $634 million  , respectively. There were no significant adjustments to the allocation  

Notes to Financial Statements 

of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the naviHealth and Harvard Drug acquisitions from those disclosed in our fiscal 2016 Form 10-K.  We recorded additional goodwill for Cordis of   $82 million  , substantially all of which was to increase an accrual for assumed pre-acquisition product liability lawsuits. See   Note 7   for further discussion of the product liability lawsuits. 
   
  3. Restructuring and Employee Severance    
  The following table summarizes restructuring and employee severance costs: 

(1) 
    Employee-related costs primarily consist of termination benefits provided to employees who have been involuntarily terminated and duplicate payroll costs during transition periods. 
              (2) 
    Facility exit and other costs primarily consist of lease termination costs, accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation costs, project consulting fees and costs associated with restructuring our delivery of information technology infrastructure services. 
     The following table summarizes activity related to liabilities associated with restructuring and employee severance: 

4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
  Goodwill 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment and in total: 

Other Intangible Assets 
  The following tables summarize other intangible assets by class at: 

Total amortization of intangible assets was   $101 million   and   $67 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Estimated annual amortization of intangible assets for the remainder of fiscal   2017   through   2021   is as follows:   $285 million  ,   $350 million  ,   $281 million  ,   $254 million  , and   $207 million  . 

Notes to Financial Statements 

5. Available-for-Sale Securities    
  We invest in marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We held the following investments in marketable securities at fair value at: 

Gross unrealized gains and losses were immaterial at both   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gross realized gains and losses were immaterial and we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments. At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average effective maturity of our current and long-term investments was approximately   6 months   and   17 months  , respectively. 
   
  6. Income Taxes 
  Fluctuations in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings ( effective tax rate ) are due to changes in international and U.S. state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate was   37.3 percent   and   32.3 percent  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included net favorable discrete items of   $28 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , we had   $532 million   and   $527 million   of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. The   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , balances include   $358 million   and   $355 million   of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , we had   $149 million   and   $145 million  , respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which we recognize in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated  

statements of earnings. These balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
  It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or other taxing authorities, possible settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits or the expiration of statutes of limitations. We estimate that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is between   zero   and a net decrease of   $175 million  , exclusive of penalties and interest. 
  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2006 through the current fiscal year. 
  We are a party to a tax matters agreement with CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), which has been acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company. Under the tax matters agreement, CareFusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to our fiscal 2010 spin-off of CareFusion. The indemnification receivable was   $126 million   and   $172 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, and is included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  7. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation    
  Commitments 
  Generic Sourcing Venture with CVS Health Corporation ("CVS Health") 
  In   July 2014  , we established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ("Red Oak Sourcing"), a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with CVS Health for an initial term of   10 years  . Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies. Due to the achievement of predetermined milestones, we are required to make quarterly payments of   $45.6 million   to CVS Health for the remainder of the initial term. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  We become involved from time to time in disputes, litigation, and regulatory matters. 
  We may be named from time to time in   qui tam   actions, which are initiated by private third parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments and which allege that false claims have been submitted or have been caused to be submitted for payment by the government. After a private party has filed a   qui tam   action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own on behalf of the government. 
  From time to time, we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer, supplier, or other industry participant. Most  

Notes to Financial Statements 

of these matters are resolved without incident; however, such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us.  
  From time to time, we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue,   we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. Such actions can lead to product recalls, costs to repair or replace affected products, temporary interruptions in product sales, action by regulators, and product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. 
  We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation, and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. 
  With respect to the matters described below, except as otherwise stated, we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters for which there is no accrual, or additional loss for matters for which we have recorded an accrual, since damages or fines have not been specified or the proceedings are at stages where significant uncertainty exists as to legal or factual issues and as to whether such matters will proceed to trial. We do not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations for a particular quarterly period. 
  We recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets. 
  Except as otherwise stated below, we recognize estimated loss contingencies for litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net in our condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 

DEA Investigation and Related Matters 
  In February 2012, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the "DEA") issued an order to show cause and immediate suspension of our Lakeland, Florida distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances, asserting that we failed to maintain required controls against the diversion of controlled substances. In May 2012, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DEA that resolved the administrative aspects of the DEA's action but did not resolve potential liability for civil fines in Florida or elsewhere for the conduct covered by the settlement agreement. In that regard, we are continuing to discuss a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Our total accrual for this matter was   $44 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , which is included in other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  State of West Virginia vs. Cardinal Health, Inc. 
  Since June 2012, the West Virginia Attorney General has filed complaints against a number of pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, including us. The complaints, which were filed in the Circuit Court of Boone County, West Virginia, allege, among other things, that the distributors failed to maintain effective controls to guard against diversion of controlled substances in West Virginia, failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with the West Virginia Uniform Controlled Substances Act, and were negligent in distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive and other equitable relief and monetary damages. We are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 
  Product Liability Lawsuits 
  As of October 31, 2016, we and our Cordis business have been named as defendants in   31   product liability lawsuits involving claims by approximately   250   plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products. These lawsuits seek a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. We are vigorously defending ourselves in these matters.    
  Based on currently available information, we have recorded an accrual, most of which relates to legal defense costs, as an adjustment to pre-acquisition liabilities assumed in the Cordis acquisition. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding this adjustment. We do not believe that reasonably possible losses in excess of this accrued amount will be material to our financial statements.

8. Fair Value Measurements    
  The following tables present the fair values for assets and (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis at: 

(1) 
    The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including non-performance risk, and using discount rates appropriate for the respective maturities. Observable Level 2 inputs are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of these derivative contracts, which are subject to master netting arrangements under certain circumstances, is presented on a gross basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    We invest in marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Observable Level 2 inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities, interest rate spreads, yield curves and credit risk are used to determine the fair value. See   Note 5   for additional information regarding available-for-sale securities. 
              (3) 
    The other investments balance includes investments in mutual funds, which are used to offset fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These mutual funds primarily invest in the equity securities of companies with large market capitalization and high quality fixed income debt securities. The fair value of these investments is determined using quoted market prices. 
              (4) 
    Contingent consideration represents the obligations incurred in connection with acquisitions. We do not deem the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations under any single acquisition to be significant. The estimate of fair value of the contingent consideration obligations requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods, and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios and was determined using probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of reaching various targets or of achieving certain milestones. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs unobservable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Changes in current expectations of progress could change the probability of achieving the targets within the measurement periods and result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation. 

The following table presents those liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

(1) 
    Amount is included in amortization and other acquisition-related costs in the   condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
      
  9. Financial Instruments 
  We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain risks related to our ongoing operations. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments include interest rate risk, currency exchange risk, and commodity price risk. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. While the majority of our derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, we also enter into derivative instruments that are designed to hedge a risk, but are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings at the end of each period. Our derivative and hedging programs are consistent with those described in the 2016 Form 10-K. The amount of ineffectiveness associated with these derivative instruments was immaterial for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into forward interest rate swap locks with a total notional amount of   $200 million   to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, future transactions associated with our debt. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we terminated notional amounts of   $200 million   of pay-floating interest rate swaps. We received net settlement proceeds of $  14 million   related to the pay-floating interest rate swaps terminated during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the pay-floating interest rate swaps terminated in fiscal 2016, as previously disclosed in our 2016 Form 10-K. These swaps were previously designated as fair value hedges. There was no immediate impact to the condensed consolidated statements of earnings; however, the fair value adjustment to debt is being amortized over the life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. 

Notes to Financial Statements 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings compared to the respective carrying amounts at: 

The fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings is estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or other inputs derived from available market information, which represents a Level 2 measurement. 
   
  10. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests    
  Redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the third parties' share of the net assets of naviHealth.  The third-party noncontrolling interest holders hold an option that allows them to sell their noncontrolling interests to us at any time after the two-year anniversary of the closing, or earlier if a trigger event occurs.  The terms of the agreement also provide us with the option to acquire any remaining noncontrolling interests at any time after the two-year anniversary of the closing, which is August 26, 2017. Our ownership interest in naviHealth was   82 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The reconciliation of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests are as follows:  

11. Shareholders' Equity    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   3 million   common shares having an aggregate cost of   $250 million  . The average price paid per common share was   $81.37  .  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we did not repurchase any common shares. 
  We funded the repurchases with available cash. The common shares repurchased are held in treasury to be used for general corporate purposes. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss by component and in total: 

Activity related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, as described in   Note 5  , was immaterial during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

12. Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. 
  The following table reconciles the number of common shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: 

The potentially dilutive employee stock options, restricted share units, and performance share units that were antidilutive for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   3 million   and   2 million  , respectively. 
   
  13. Segment Information 
  Our operations are principally managed on a products and services basis and are comprised of   two   operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities. 

Notes to Financial Statements 

The following table presents revenue for each reportable segment and Corporate: 

(1) 
    Corporate revenue consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue and other revenue not allocated to the segments. 
     We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. Segment profit is segment revenue, less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses. Segment SG A expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial, and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, and legal and compliance. The results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided and other ratable allocation methodologies. 
  We do not allocate the following items to our segments: last-in first-out, or ("LIFO"), inventory charges/(credits); restructuring and employee severance; amortization and other acquisition-related costs; impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets; litigation (recoveries)/charges, net; other income, net; interest expense, net; loss on extinguishment of debt; and provision for income taxes.  
  In addition, certain investment spending, certain portions of enterprise-wide incentive compensation, and other spending are not allocated to the segments. Investment spending generally includes the first-year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses. We encourage our segments and corporate functions to identify investment projects that will promote innovation and provide future returns. As approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management, the expenses for such projects are often retained at Corporate. Investment spending within Corporate was   $1 million   and   $6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  The following table presents segment profit by reportable segment and Corporate:

14. Share-Based Compensation    
  We maintain stock incentive plans (collectively, the  Plans ) for the benefit of certain of our officers, directors and employees.  
  The following table provides total share-based compensation expense by type of award: 

The total tax benefit related to share-based compensation was   $8 million   and   $11 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Restricted Share Units 
  Restricted share units granted under the Plans generally vest in equal annual installments over   three years  . Restricted share units accrue cash dividend equivalents that are payable upon vesting of the awards. 
  The following table summarizes all transactions related to restricted share units under the Plans: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the total pre-tax compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted share units not yet recognized was   $121 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   two years  . 
  Stock Options 
  Employee stock options granted under the Plans generally vest in equal annual installments over   three years   and are exercisable for periods ranging from   seven   to   ten years   from the grant date. All stock options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the common shares underlying the option on the grant date. 

Notes to Financial Statements 

The following table summarizes all stock option transactions under the Plans: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the total pre-tax compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options not yet recognized was   $35 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   two years  . The following tables provide additional detail related to stock options: 

Performance Share Units 
  Performance share units vest over a   three  -year performance period based on achievement of specific performance goals. Based on the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares may range from   zero   to   200 percent   of the target award amount. Performance share units accrue cash dividend equivalents that are payable upon vesting of the awards. 
  The following table summarizes all transactions related to performance share units under the Plans (based on target award amounts): 

(1)    Vested based on achievement of   170 percent   of the target performance goal. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total pre-tax compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested performance share units not yet recognized was   $23 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   two years  .

  Cardinal Health, Inc.

  Dublin, OH 43017 
    
           RE:  
    Side Letter regarding Pre-Closing Product Registration Transfer Process for Certain Remaining Day 2 Countries. 
       
  Dear Sir or Madam: 
    
  Reference is made to the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2015 (the    SAPA   ), by and between Ethicon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation (   Buyer   ), pursuant to which Buyer purchased the Business (as such term is defined in the SAPA) from Seller.  Each capitalized term used and not defined in this letter agreement shall have the meaning assigned to it in the SAPA.    
    
  Seller and Cardinal Health Switzerland 515 GMBH, an Affiliate of Buyer (   Cardinal Switzerland   ) are parties to the Transition Services Agreement (the    TSA   ), dated October 2, 2015, pursuant to which Seller and certain of its Affiliates provide certain services to Cardinal Switzerland and its Affiliates to facilitate the transition of the Business. 
    
  Seller and Cardinal Switzerland are also parties to a Distribution Agreement (the    Distribution Agreement   ) dated October 2, 2015, with respect to the Non-Principal Country Units, including those set forth in   Exhibit A   (each, together with each country into which they sell the Products, a    Day 2 Territory    and together, the    Day 2 Territories   ), pursuant to which Seller has agreed to provide Distribution Services (as such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement) for the Day 2 Products (as such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement) in such Day 2 Territories until the applicable Closing for such Day 2 Territories (the    Day 2 Closings   ). 
    
  In accordance with Section 11.05 of the SAPA, Seller and Buyer wish to amend Section 2.01(b) of the SAPA to permit Buyer and its Affiliates to undertake certain actions set forth below with respect to the Day 2 Products in the applicable Day 2 Territories in advance of the applicable Day 2 Closings (the    Closing Facilitation Steps   ).  For the avoidance of doubt, this letter agreement shall apply only to the Day 2 Products in the applicable Day 2 Territories, and shall not modify or otherwise affect the rights and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates or Buyer and its Affiliates in any other Non-Principal Country Unit. 
    
  In order to better position the Business in each Day 2 Territory to transfer to Buyer, Buyer may take, or cause Buyer s Affiliates to take (and Seller hereby expressly consents to and shall cooperate with and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer with), the following Closing Facilitation Steps: 
    
           1. 
    Seller or its Affiliates in the Day 2 Territories shall deliver to Buyer, promptly following request from Buyer, product registration certificates and other applicable documentation required for Buyer to obtain market authorization holder registration for the Day 2 Products listed in the Distribution Agreement for such Day 2 Territory.  Product registration certificates and other applicable documentation shall be provided in the local language if required by applicable Law and in English, where available.   
       
           2. 
    Promptly following the delivery of the certificates described in clause 1 above, Buyer shall initiate the local regulatory processes required to obtain requisite marketing authorization, permissions, approvals and other  

documentation (collectively, the    Product Licenses   ) from the Food and Drug Administration or similar Governmental Entity of the applicable Day 2 Territory (for each Day 2 Territory, the    Regulatory Authority   ) necessary to allow the Buyer to market and sell the Day 2 Products upon the applicable Day 2 Closing. 
    
           3. 
    Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in effecting the Closing Facilitation Steps, including providing all information requested by Buyer to Buyer on a timely basis, and attending such meetings (in person or telephonically) with the applicable Regulatory Authority, in each case as may be required by applicable Laws or practices or as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Closing Facilitation Steps.   
       
           4. 
    For each Day 2 Territory, Buyer or an Affiliate or representative thereof shall notify Seller of the receipt of the applicable Product Licenses from the applicable Regulatory Authority as soon as practical (and in any event not later than 10 days) after receipt by Buyer.  Seller shall have no liability for any Damages (as such term is defined in the SAPA) including importation delays or disruption to Business operations in the applicable Day 2 Territory, caused by or arising out of Buyer s failure to deliver such notice to Seller.  Upon the receipt of the applicable Product Licenses in such Day 2 Territory from the applicable Regulatory Authority, Buyer shall fully assume all responsibility for holding and maintaining such Product Licenses including the performance of all legal, regulatory, quality assurance, compliance and other obligations stemming from ownership of such Product Licenses and, notwithstanding any provisions of the SAPA, the TSA, the Distribution Agreement or any other Transaction Documents to the contrary, Seller and its Affiliates shall bear no liability to Buyer or its Affiliates with respect thereto and shall be indemnified by Buyer against any third-party claims resulting therefrom. 
       
           5. 
    In the event that Buyer receives the applicable Product Licenses required to market and sell the applicable Day 2 Products in a Day 2 Territory prior to such Day 2 Closing and, as a consequence, Seller and its Affiliates are no longer able to import, sell or distribute Product in such Day 2 Territory, Buyer agrees to (i) waive any claim against Seller or its Affiliates under the SAPA, the TSA, the Distribution Agreement or any other Transaction Document with respect to the performance of the applicable Service (as such term is defined in the TSA), and (ii) indemnify Seller against any Damages resulting therefrom.      
       
           6. 
    Provided Seller has complied with its obligations in the SAPA and clause 3 above, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the risk of any Damages incurred by the Business arising from Buyer filing to obtain and/or receiving the applicable Product Licenses in advance of the applicable Day 2 Closing shall be solely born by Buyer.  Buyer takes full responsibility to establish appropriate Day 2 Product inventories at Buyer s expense prior to the transfer of such Product Licenses or the issuance of Product Licenses in the name of Buyer or an Affiliate thereof, as applicable, in order to mitigate any Business disruption stemming from such transfer or issuance.   Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary Product Licenses for each Day 2 Territory on or prior to such Day 2 Closing.   In the event that Buyer is unable through no fault of its own to obtain such Product License on or prior to the respective Day 2 Closing, and Buyer believes that additional post-closing regulatory support for the Products (   Post-Closing Services   ) is required, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and request such Post-Closing Services.  The terms and duration of such Post-Closing Services, if any, shall be as mutually agreed upon by the parties.     
       
           7. 
    Provided Seller has complied with its obligations in the SAPA and clause 3 above, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against and from any and all Damages which Seller and any Seller Indemnities may incur or suffer to the extent such Damages arise out of or result from the Closing Facilitation Steps set forth in this letter agreement, including any Damages that Seller and its Affiliates may incur due to any action by a third-party service provider, distributor or other agent engaged by Buyer to assist in the Closing Facilitation Steps or receive any Product License on behalf of Buyer (each a    Third Party Market Authorization Holder   )  
     
   2 

in accordance with the provisions of Article X of the SAPA.   Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates and Service Providers (as such term is defined in the TSA) are not party to any agreement or arrangement between Buyer and any Third Party Market Authorization Holder, and Seller and its Affiliates and Service Providers shall not be liable in any way for any claims arising out of or any Damages suffered by either Buyer or such Third Party Market Authorization Holder or such party s affiliates and assigns pursuant thereto. 
    
  In the event that a Regulatory Authority for an applicable Day 2 Territory enacts any rule, regulation or other regulatory guideline that would prohibit Seller or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates from completing the actions contemplated herein or as required by the SAPA, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to reassess the approach and modify the terms of this letter agreement as may be necessary.   
    
  Except as expressly set forth herein, this Letter Agreement shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair, constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates under the SAPA or other Transaction Documents, and, except as otherwise expressly agreed to herein, shall not alter, modify or amend any of the terms, conditions, obligations or agreements of Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates contained in the Transaction Documents, all of which shall continue in full force and effect.

Exhibit 

Computation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges  

(1) 
    The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing fixed charges into earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges and capitalized interest. Fixed charges include interest expense, amortization of debt offering costs and the portion of rent expense that is deemed to be representative of the interest factor. Interest expense recorded on tax exposures has been recorded in income tax expense and has therefore been excluded from the calculation.
