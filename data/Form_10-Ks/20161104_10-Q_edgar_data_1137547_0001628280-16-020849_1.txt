United Security Bancshares and Subsidiaries - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Unaudited) 

1. 
    Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies 
       
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Security Bancshares, and its wholly owned subsidiary United Security Bank (the  Bank ) and   two   bank subsidiaries, USB Investment Trust (the  REIT ) and United Security Emerging Capital Fund (collectively the  Company  or  USB ).  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  These unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information on a basis consistent with the accounting policies reflected in the audited financial statements of the Company included in its 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  These interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal, recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the year as a whole. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  : 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326). The FASB is issuing this Update to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The Update requires enhanced disclosures and judgments in estimating credit losses and also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The Board is issuing this Update as part of its Simplification Initiative. The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas for simplification in this Update were identified through outreach for the Simplification Initiative, pre-agenda research for the Private Company Council, and the August 2014 Post-Implementation Review Report on FASB No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.  We are currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842).   The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. To meet that objective, the FASB is amending the   FASB Accounting Standards Codification    and creating Topic 842, Leases. This Update, along with IFRS 16,   Leases  , are the results of the FASB s and the International Accounting Standards Board s (IASB s) efforts to meet that objective and improve financial reporting. This ASU will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (i.e., calendar periods beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods therein.  We are currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurements of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   This ASU requires equity investments to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendment also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value is not readily determinable by requiring an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements, however, we believe the accounting and reporting for our mutual fund investments will be impacted. 
    
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) -Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. GAAP requires that during the amendment period, the acquirer retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Those adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets or liabilities. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business

     Table of Contents  

combination, the amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. These amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company does not expect any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements resulting from the adoption of the update. 

2. 
    Investment Securities  
       
  Following is a comparison of the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Contractual maturities on collateralized mortgage obligations cannot be anticipated due to allowed paydowns. Mutual funds are included in the "due in one year or less" category below. 

There were   no   realized gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . There were   no   other-than-temporary impairment losses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , available-for-sale securities with an amortized cost of approximately   $20,611,478   (fair value of   $21,123,859  ) were pledged as collateral for FHLB borrowings and public funds balances. 
    
  The Company had   no   held-to-maturity or trading securities at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 

10 

     Table of Contents  

Management periodically evaluates each available-for-sale investment security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. 
    
  The following summarizes temporarily impaired investment securities: 

Temporarily impaired securities at   September 30, 2016  , were comprised of   one   mutual fund,   four   U.S. government agency securities, and   three   U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations securities.  
    
  The Company evaluates investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into   two   general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC Topic 320,   Investments   Debt and Equity Instruments  . Certain purchased beneficial interests, including non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, are evaluated under ASC Topic 325-40,   Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets. 
    
  In the first segment, the Company considers many factors in determining OTTI, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to the Company at the time of the evaluation. 
    
  The second segment of the portfolio uses the OTTI guidance that is specific to purchased beneficial interests including private label mortgage-backed securities. Under this model, the Company compares the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date to the current expected remaining cash flows. An OTTI is deemed to have occurred if there has been an adverse change in the remaining expected future cash flows. 

11 

     Table of Contents  

Additionally, other-than-temporary-impairment occurs when the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss.  If the Company intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the other-than-temporary-impairment shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.  If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the other-than-temporary-impairment shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors.  The amount of the total other-than-temporary-impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings, and is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the current amortized cost of the security.  The amount of the total other-than-temporary-impairment related to other factors shall be recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income, net of applicable taxes.  The previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary-impairment recognized in earnings shall become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the decline in market value of the impaired mutual fund, the   four   U.S. government agency securities, and the   three   U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations securities is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality. Because the Company does not have the intent to sell these impaired securities, and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  

Loans are comprised of the following: 

The Company's loans are predominantly in the San Joaquin Valley and the greater Oakhurst/East Madera County area, as well as the Campbell area of Santa Clara County. Although the Company does participate in loans with other financial institutions, they are primarily in the state of California. 
    
  Commercial and industrial loans represent   8.5%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   and are generally made to support the ongoing operations of small-to-medium sized commercial businesses. Commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification and provide working capital, financing for the purchase of manufacturing plants and equipment, or funding for growth and general expansion of businesses. A substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases, or other collateral including real estate. The remainder are unsecured; however, extensions of credit are predicated upon the financial capacity of the borrower. Repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. 
    
  Real estate mortgage loans, representing   51.8%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  , are secured by trust deeds on primarily commercial property, but are also secured by trust deeds on single family residences. Repayment of real estate mortgage loans generally comes from the cash flow of the borrower. 

Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise the largest segment of this loan category and are available on all types of income producing and commercial properties, including: office buildings, shopping centers; apartments  
     
   12 

     Table of Contents  

and motels; owner occupied buildings; manufacturing facilities and more. Commercial real estate mortgage loans can also be used to refinance existing debt. Although real estate associated with the business is the primary collateral for commercial real estate mortgage loans, the underlying real estate is not the source of repayment. Commercial real estate loans are made under the premise that the loan will be repaid from the borrower's business operations, rental income associated with the real property, or personal assets. 

Residential mortgage loans are provided to individuals to finance or refinance single-family residences. Residential mortgages are not a primary business line offered by the Company, and a majority are conventional mortgages that were purchased as a pool.  Most residential mortgages originated by the Company are of a shorter term than conventional mortgages, with maturities ranging from   3   to   15 years   on average. 

Home Improvement and Home Equity loans comprise a relatively small portion of total real estate mortgage loans, and are offered to borrowers for the purpose of home improvements, although the proceeds may be used for other purposes. Home equity loans are generally secured by junior trust deeds, but may be secured by 1   st    trust deeds. 
       
  Real estate construction and development loans, representing   23.4%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  , consist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as land acquisition and development, or land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate including improved and unimproved land, as well as single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment on construction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project. 
    
  Agricultural loans represent   9.5%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   and are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory and receivables. Repayment is from the cash flow of the borrower. 
    
  Installment loans represent   6.7%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   and generally consist of student loans, loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures such as credit cards, automobiles or other consumer items. 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit of   $113,058,000   and   $107,084,000  , respectively, and standby letters of credit of   $2,833,000   and   $3,295,000  , respectively. These instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in off-balance sheet financial instruments. 
    
  The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
    
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. A majority of these commitments are at floating interest rates based on the Prime rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but includes accounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing properties. 
    
  Standby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.

Past Due Loans 
    
  The Company monitors delinquency and potential problem loans on an ongoing basis through weekly reports to the Loan Committee and monthly reports to the Board of Directors. The following is a summary of delinquent loans at   September 30, 2016   (in 000's): 

The following is a summary of delinquent loans at   December 31, 2015   (in 000's): 

Nonaccrual Loans 
    
  Commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans are placed on nonaccrual status under the following circumstances: 
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

- When there is doubt regarding the full repayment of interest and principal. 
    
  - When principal and/or interest on the loan has been in default for a period of   90  -days or more, unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection that will result in repayment in the near future. 
    
  - When the loan is identified as having loss elements and/or is risk rated "8" Doubtful. 
    
  Other circumstances which jeopardize the ultimate collectability of the loan including certain troubled debt restructurings, identified loan impairment, and certain loans to facilitate the sale of OREO. 
    
  Loans meeting any of the preceding criteria are placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest for financial statement purposes is discontinued. Previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against interest income. 
    
  All other loans where principal or interest is due and unpaid for   90   days or more are placed on nonaccrual and the accrual of interest for financial statement purposes is discontinued. Previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against interest income. 
    
  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status and subsequent payments of interest (and principal) are received, the interest received may be accounted for in two separate ways. 
    
  Cost recovery method  : If the loan is in doubt as to full collection, the interest received in subsequent payments is diverted from interest income to a valuation reserve and treated as a reduction of principal for financial reporting purposes. 
    
  Cash basis  : This method is only used if the recorded investment or total contractual amount is expected to be fully collectible, under which circumstances the subsequent payments of interest are credited to interest income as received. 
    
  Loans on non-accrual status are usually not returned to accrual status unless all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current, there is no identified element of loss, and current and continued satisfactory performance is expected (loss of the contractual amount not the carrying amount of the loan). Return to accrual is generally demonstrated through the timely receipt of at least   six   monthly payments on a loan with monthly amortization. 
    
  Nonaccrual loans totaled   $7,747,000   and   $8,193,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. There were no remaining undisbursed commitments to extend credit on nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following is a summary of nonaccrual loan balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in 000's).

Impaired Loans 
    
  A loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 
    
  The Company applies its normal loan review procedures in making judgments regarding probable losses and loan impairment. The Company evaluates for impairment those loans on nonaccrual status, graded doubtful, graded substandard or those that are troubled debt restructures. The primary basis for inclusion in impaired status under generally accepted accounting pronouncements is that it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 
    
  A loan is not considered impaired if there is merely an insignificant delay or shortfall in the amounts of payments and the Company expects to collect all amounts due, including interest accrued, at the contractual interest rate for the period of the delay. 
    
  Review for impairment does not include large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated to estimate the allowance for loan losses. The Company s present allowance for loan losses methodology, including migration analysis, captures required reserves for these loans in the formula allowance. 
    
  For loans determined to be impaired, the Company evaluates impairment based upon either the fair value of underlying collateral, discounted cash flows of expected payments, or observable market price. 
    
           -  
    For loans secured by collateral including real estate and equipment, the fair value of the collateral less selling costs will determine the carrying value of the loan. The difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the fair value, less selling costs, determines the amount of impairment. The Company uses the measurement method based on fair value of collateral when the loan is collateral dependent and foreclosure is probable.  For loans that are not considered collateral dependent, a discounted cash flow methodology is used. 
       
           -  
    The discounted cash flow method of measuring the impairment of a loan is used for impaired loans that are not considered to be collateral dependent. Under this method, the Company assesses both the amount and timing of cash flows expected from impaired loans. The estimated cash flows are discounted using the loan's effective interest rate. The difference between the amount of the loan on the Bank's books and the discounted cash flow amounts determines the amount of impairment to be provided. This method is used for most of the Company s troubled debt restructurings or other impaired loans where some payment stream is being collected. 
       
           -  
    The observable market price method of measuring the impairment of a loan is only used by the Company when the sale of loans or a loan is in process. 
       
  The method for recognizing interest income on impaired loans is dependent on whether the loan is on nonaccrual status or is a troubled debt restructure. For income recognition, the existing nonaccrual and troubled debt restructuring policies are applied to impaired loans. Generally, except for certain troubled debt restructurings which are performing under the restructure agreement, the Company does not recognize interest income received on impaired loans, but reduces the carrying amount of the loan for financial reporting purposes. 
    
  Loans other than certain homogeneous loan portfolios are reviewed on a quarterly basis for impairment. Impaired loans are written down to estimated realizable values by the establishment of specific reserves for loan utilizing the discounted cash flow method, or charge-offs for collateral-based impaired loans, or those using observable market pricing.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
    
  In certain circumstances, when the Company grants a concession to a borrower as part of a loan restructuring, the restructuring is accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). TDRs are reported as a component of impaired loans. 
    
  A TDR is a type of restructuring in which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession (either imposed by court order, law, or agreement between the borrower and the Bank) to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Although the restructuring may take different forms, the Company's objective is to maximize recovery of its investment by granting relief to the borrower. 
    
  A TDR may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: 
    
  -  A transfer from the borrower to the Company of receivables from third parties, real estate, other assets, or an equity interest in the borrower is granted to fully or partially satisfy the loan. 
    
  -  A modification of terms of a debt such as one or a combination of: 

The reduction (absolute or contingent) of the stated interest rate. 
                
    The extension of the maturity date or dates at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. 
                
    The reduction (absolute or contingent) of the face amount or maturity amount of debt as stated in the instrument or agreement. 
                
    The reduction (absolute or contingent) of accrued interest. 
     For a restructured loan to return to accrual status there needs to be, among other factors, at least   6 months   successful payment history. In addition, the Company performs a financial analysis of the credit to determine whether the borrower has the ability to continue to meet payments over the remaining life of the loan. This includes, but is not limited to, a review of financial statements and cash flow analysis of the borrower. Only after determination that the borrower has the ability to perform under the terms of the loans, will the restructured credit be considered for accrual status. Although the Company does not have a policy which specifically addresses when a loan may be removed from TDR classification, as a matter of practice, loans classified as TDRs generally remain classified as such until the loan either reaches maturity or its outstanding balance is paid off. 
    
  The following tables illustrates TDR activity for the periods indicated:

Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  As part of its credit monitoring program, the Company utilizes a risk rating system which quantifies the risk the Company estimates it has assumed during the life of a loan. The system rates the strength of the borrower and the facility or transaction, and is designed to provide a program for risk management and early detection of problems. 
    
  For each new credit approval, credit extension, renewal, or modification of existing credit facilities, the Company assigns risk ratings utilizing the rating scale identified in this policy. In addition, on an on-going basis, loans and credit facilities are reviewed for internal and external influences impacting the credit facility that would warrant a change in the risk rating. Each loan credit facility is to be given a risk rating that takes into account factors that materially affect credit quality. 
    
  When assigning risk ratings, the Company evaluates   two   risk rating approaches, a facility rating and a borrower rating as follows: 
    
  Facility Rating: 
    
  The facility rating is determined by the analysis of positive and negative factors that may indicate that the quality of a particular loan or credit arrangement requires that it be rated differently from the risk rating assigned to the borrower. The Company assesses the risk impact of these factors: 
    
  Collateral   - The rating may be affected by the type and quality of the collateral, the degree of coverage, the economic life of the collateral, liquidation value and the Company's ability to dispose of the collateral. 
    
  Guarantees   - The value of third party support arrangements varies widely. Unconditional guaranties from persons with demonstrable ability to perform are more substantial than that of closely related persons to the borrower who offer only modest support. 
    
  Unusual Terms   - Credit may be extended on terms that subject the Company to a higher level of risk than indicated in the rating of the borrower. 
    
  Borrower Rating: 
    
  The borrower rating is a measure of loss possibility based on the historical, current and anticipated financial characteristics of the borrower in the current risk environment. To determine the rating, the Company considers at least the following factors: 
    
  -    Quality of management 
  -    Liquidity 
  -    Leverage/capitalization 
  -    Profit margins/earnings trend 
  -    Adequacy of financial records 
  -    Alternative funding sources 
  -    Geographic risk 
  -    Industry risk 
  -    Cash flow risk 
  -    Accounting practices 
  -    Asset protection 
  -    Extraordinary risks 
    
  The Company assigns risk ratings to loans other than consumer loans and other homogeneous loan pools based on the following scale. The risk ratings are used when determining borrower ratings as well as facility ratings. When the borrower rating and the facility ratings differ, the lowest rating applied is: 
    
           - 
    Grades 1 and 2     These grades include loans which are given to high quality borrowers with high credit quality and sound financial strength. Key financial ratios are generally above industry averages and the borrower s strong earnings history or net worth. These may be secured by deposit accounts or high-grade investment securities. 
       
           - 
    Grade 3     This grade includes loans to borrowers with solid credit quality with minimal risk. The borrower s balance sheet and financial ratios are generally in line with industry averages, and the borrower has historically demonstrated the ability to manage economic adversity. Real estate and asset-based loans assigned this risk rating must have  
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

characteristics, which place them well above the minimum underwriting requirements for those departments. Asset-based borrowers assigned this rating must exhibit extremely favorable leverage and cash flow characteristics, and consistently demonstrate a high level of unused borrowing capacity. 
    
           - 
    Grades 4 and 5   These include  pass  grade loans to borrowers of acceptable credit quality and risk. The borrower s balance sheet and financial ratios may be below industry averages, but above the lowest industry quartile. Leverage is above and liquidity is below industry averages. Inadequacies evident in financial performance and/or management sufficiency are offset by readily available features of support, such as adequate collateral, or good guarantors having the liquid assets and/or cash flow capacity to repay the debt. The borrower may have recognized a loss over   three   or   four   years, however recent earnings trends, while perhaps somewhat cyclical, are improving and cash flows are adequate to cover debt service and fixed obligations. Real estate and asset-borrowers fully comply with all underwriting standards and are performing according to projections would be assigned this rating. These also include grade 5 loans which are  leveraged  or on management s  watch list.  While still considered pass loans (loans given a grade 5), the borrower s financial condition, cash flow or operations evidence more than average risk and short term weaknesses, these loans warrant a higher than average level of monitoring, supervision and attention from the Company, but do not reflect credit weakness trends that weaken or inadequately protect the Company s credit position. Loans with a grade rating of 5 are not normally acceptable as new credits unless they are adequately secured or carry substantial endorser/guarantors. 
       
           - 
    Grade 6     This grade includes  special mention  loans which are loans that are currently protected but are potentially weak. This generally is an interim grade classification and should usually be upgraded to an Acceptable rating or downgraded to Substandard within a reasonable time period. Weaknesses in special mention loans may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are often loans with weaknesses inherent from the loan origination, loan servicing, and perhaps some technical deficiencies. The main theme in special mention credits is the distinct probability that the classification will deteriorate to a more adverse class if the noted deficiencies are not addressed by the loan officer or loan management. 
       
           - 
    Grade 7     This grade includes  substandard  loans which are inadequately supported by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may impair the regular liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans exhibit a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Substandard loans also include impaired loans. 
       
           - 
    Grade 8     This grade includes  doubtful  loans which exhibit the same characteristics as the Substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include a proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans. 
       
           - 
    Grade 9     This grade includes loans classified  loss  which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. 
       
  The Company did not carry any loans graded as loss at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

The following tables summarize the credit risk ratings for commercial, construction, and other non-consumer related loans for   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company follows consistent underwriting standards outlined in its loan policy for consumer and other homogeneous loans but, does not specifically assign a risk rating when these loans are originated. Consumer loans are monitored for credit risk and are considered  pass  loans until some issue or event requires that the credit be downgraded to special mention or worse. 
    
  The following tables summarize the credit risk ratings for consumer related loans and other homogeneous loans for   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The Company analyzes risk characteristics inherent in each loan portfolio segment as part of the quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The following summarizes some of the key risk characteristics for the   eleven   segments of the loan portfolio (Consumer loans include   three   segments): 

25 

     Table of Contents  

Commercial and industrial loans     Commercial loans are subject to the effects of economic cycles and tend to exhibit increased risk as economic conditions deteriorate, or if the economic downturn is prolonged. The Company considers this segment to be one of higher risk given the size of individual loans and the balances in the overall portfolio. 
    
  Government program loans     This is a relatively a small part of the Company s loan portfolio, but has historically had a high percentage of loans that have migrated from pass to substandard given there vulnerability to economic cycles. 
    
  Commercial real estate loans     This segment is considered to have more risk in part because of the vulnerability of commercial businesses to economic cycles as well as the exposure to fluctuations in real estate prices because most of these loans are secured by real estate. Losses in this segment have however been historically low because most of the loans are real estate secured, and the bank maintains appropriate loan-to-value ratios. 
    
  Residential mortgages     This segment is considered to have low risk factors both from the Company and peer statistics. These loans are secured by first deeds of trust. The losses experienced over the past twelve quarters are isolated to approximately   twelve   loans and are generally the result of short sales. 
    
  Home improvement and home equity loans     Because of their junior lien position, these loans have an inherently higher risk level. Because residential real estate has been severely distressed in the recent past, the anticipated risk for this loan segment has increased. 
    
  Real estate construction and development loans    In a normal economy, this segment of loans is considered to have a higher risk profile due to construction and market value issues in conjunction with normal credit risks.  Although residential real estate markets have improved, they are still distressed on a historical basis, and therefore carry higher risk. 
    
  Agricultural loans     This segment is considered to have risks associated with weather, insects, and marketing issues. In addition, concentrations in certain crops or certain agricultural areas can increase risk. 
    
  Installment loans   (Includes consumer loans, overdrafts, and overdraft protection lines)   This segment is higher risk because many of the loans are unsecured.

FHLB advances are collateralized by the Company s stock in the FHLB, investment securities, and certain qualifying mortgage loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $2,363,000   in investment securities at FHLB were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances.  Additionally,   $484,125,000   in secured and unsecured loans were pledged at   September 30, 2016  , as collateral for borrowing lines with the Federal Reserve Bank totaling   $337,189,000  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had collateralized lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco totaling   $302,456,000  , as well as Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) lines of credit totaling   $2,854,000  .  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an uncollateralized line of credit with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank ("PCBB") totaling   $10,000,000  .

    Common Stock Dividend 
       
  On   September 27, 2016  , the Company s Board of Directors declared a one-percent (  1%  ) stock dividend on the Company s outstanding common stock. Based upon the number of outstanding common shares on the record date of   October 10, 2016  ,   163,726   additional shares were issued to shareholders on October 21, 2016. Because the stock dividend was considered a  small stock dividend,  approximately   $1,031,717   was transferred from retained earnings to common stock based upon the   $6.24   closing price of the Company s common stock on the declaration date of   September 27, 2016  . There were no fractional shares paid. Except for earnings-per-share calculations, shares issued for the stock dividend have been treated prospectively for financial reporting purposes. For purposes of earnings per share calculations, the Company s weighted average shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares used in the computation of earnings per share have been restated after giving retroactive effect to a   1%   stock dividend to shareholders for all periods presented. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company's Board of Director's issued a one-percent (  1%  ) stock dividend on the Company's outstanding common stock.  Approximately   $886,791   was transferred from retained earnings to common stock and   160,492   additional shares were issued to shareholders.  For purposes of earnings per share calculations, the Company s weighted average shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares used in the computation of earnings per share have been restated after giving retroactive effect to a   1%   stock dividend to shareholders for all periods presented. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company's Board of Director's issued a one-percent (  1%  ) stock dividend on the Company's outstanding common stock.

    Taxes on Income 
       
  The Company periodically reviews its tax positions under the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes, which defines the criteria that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity s financial statements. Under the guidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination. The term  more likely than not  means a likelihood of   more than 50 percent  . In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority and all available information is known to the taxing authority. 
    
  The Company periodically evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required based upon a determination that some or all of the deferred assets may not be ultimately realized. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   recorded valuation allowance.

The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S federal jurisdiction, and several states within the U.S. There are no filings in foreign jurisdictions. During 2014, the Company began the process to amend its California state tax returns for the years 2009 through 2012 to file a combined report on a unitary basis with the Company and USB Investment Trust.  The amended returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011 were filed in 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively. The amended returns for 2012 will be filed prior to year-end 2016.  During the third quarter of 2016, the IRS notified the Company it would be conducting an examination of the Company's 2014 federal return.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is unaware of any change in tax positions as a result of the IRS examination. 
    
  The Company's policy is to recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

    Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities 
       
  Effective September 30, 2009 and beginning with the   quarterly   interest payment due October 1, 2009, the Company elected to defer interest payments on the Company's   $15.0 million   of junior subordinated debentures relating to its trust preferred securities. The terms of the debentures and trust indentures allow for the Company to defer interest payments for up to   20   consecutive quarters without default or penalty. During the period that the interest deferrals were elected, the Company continued to record interest expense associated with the debentures. As of June 30, 2014, the Company ended the extension period, paid all accrued and unpaid interest, and is currently making quarterly interest payments.  The Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at anytime at par. 
    
  During August 2015, the Bank purchased   $3.0 million   of the Company's junior subordinated debentures related to the Company's trust preferred securities at a fair value discount of   40%  .  Subsequently, in September 2015, the Company purchased those shares from the Bank and canceled   $3.0 million   in par value of the junior subordinated debentures, realizing a   $78,000   gain on redemption.  The contractual principal balance of the Company's debentures relating to its trust preferred securities is   $12.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The fair value guidance generally permits the measurement of selected eligible financial instruments at fair value at specified election dates. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option for its junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II. The Company believes the election of fair value accounting for the junior subordinated debentures better reflects the true economic value of the debt instrument on the balance sheet. The rate paid on the junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II is 3-month LIBOR plus   129   basis points, and is adjusted quarterly. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   the Company performed a fair value measurement analysis on its junior subordinated debt using a cash flow model approach to determine the present value of those cash flows. The cash flow model utilizes the forward 3-month LIBOR curve to estimate future quarterly interest payments due over the   thirty  -year life of the debt instrument. These cash flows were discounted at a rate which incorporates a current market rate for similar-term debt instruments, adjusted for additional credit and liquidity risks associated with the junior subordinated debt. We believe the   5.83%   discount rate used represents what a market participant would consider under the circumstances based on current market assumptions. At   September 30, 2016  , the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt is   $4,262,000  . 
    
  The fair value calculation performed at   September 30, 2016   resulted in a pretax   gain   adjustment of   $48,000   (  $28,000  , net of tax) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a pretax   gain   adjustment of   $346,000   (  $204,000  , net of tax) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Fair value gains and losses are reflected as a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The fair value calculation performed at   September 30, 2016   resulted in a pretax   loss   adjustment of   $423,000   (  $249,000  , net of tax) for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a pretax   gain   adjustment of   $148,000   (  $86,000  , net of tax) for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure 
       
  The following summary disclosures are made in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC Topic 825,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,   Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ), which requires the disclosure of fair value information about both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments where it is practicable to estimate that value. 
    
  Generally accepted accounting guidance clarifies the definition of fair value, describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands fair value disclosure requirements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements.

     Table of Contents  

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (as defined) for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). 
    
  The table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorized at the periods indicated: 

32 

     Table of Contents  

The Company performs fair value measurements on certain assets and liabilities as the result of the application of current accounting guidelines. Some fair value measurements, such as available-for-sale securities (AFS) and junior subordinated debt are performed on a recurring basis, while others, such as impairment of loans, other real estate owned, goodwill and other intangibles, are performed on a nonrecurring basis. 
    
  The Company s Level 1 financial assets consist of money market funds and highly liquid mutual funds for which fair values are based on quoted market prices. The Company s Level 2 financial assets include highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies, collateralized mortgage obligations, and debt obligations of states and political subdivisions, whose fair values are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for the identical or similar underlying security that may, or may not, be actively traded. The Company s Level 3 financial assets include certain impaired loans, other real estate owned, goodwill, and intangible assets where the assumptions may be made by us or third parties about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. From time to time, the Company recognizes transfers between Level 1, 2, and 3 when a change in circumstances warrants a transfer. There were   no   transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three or   nine month period  s ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   - The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate their estimated fair values. 
    
  Interest-bearing Deposits     Interest bearing deposits in other banks consist of fixed-rate certificates of deposits. Accordingly, fair value has been estimated based upon interest rates currently being offered on deposits with similar characteristics and maturities. 
    
  Investments     Available for sale securities are valued based upon open-market price quotes obtained from reputable third-party brokers that actively make a market in those securities. Market pricing is based upon specific CUSIP identification for each individual security. To the extent there are observable prices in the market, the mid-point of the bid/ask price is used to determine fair value of individual securities. If that data is not available for the last 30 days, a Level 2-type matrix pricing approach based on comparable securities in the market is utilized. Level 2 pricing may include using a forward spread from the last observable trade or may use a proxy bond like a TBA mortgage to come up with a price for the security being valued. Changes in fair market value are recorded through other comprehensive loss as the securities are available for sale. 

33 

     Table of Contents  

Loans   - Fair values of variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, are based on carrying values adjusted for credit risk.  Fair values for all other loans, except impaired loans, are estimated using discounted cash flows over their remaining maturities, using interest rates at which similar loans would currently be offered to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  The allowance for loan loss is considered to be a reasonable estimate of loan discount for credit quality concerns. 
    
  Impaired Loans -   Fair value measurements for collateral dependent impaired loans are performed pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance and are based upon either collateral values supported by appraisals and observed market prices. Collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral. Changes are recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned -   Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.  Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property, resulting in a Level 3 classification.  In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. 
    
  Deposits     Fair values for transaction and savings accounts are equal to the respective amounts payable on demand (i.e., carrying amounts). Fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit were estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Junior Subordinated Debt     The fair value of the junior subordinated debt was determined based upon a discounted cash flows model utilizing observable market rates and credit characteristics for similar debt instruments. In its analysis, the Company used characteristics that market participants generally use, and considered factors specific to (a) the liability, (b) the principal (or most advantageous) market for the liability, and (c) market participants with whom the reporting entity would transact in that market. Cash flows are discounted at a rate which incorporates a current market rate for similar-term debt instruments, adjusted for credit and liquidity risks associated with similar junior subordinated debt and circumstances unique to the Company. The Company believes that the subjective nature of theses inputs, due primarily to the current economic environment, require the junior subordinated debt to be classified as a Level 3 fair value. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable     - The carrying value of these instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Instruments   - Off-balance sheet instruments consist of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and derivative contracts. Fair values of commitments to extend credit are estimated using the interest rate currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present counterparties  credit standing. There was no material difference between the contractual amount and the estimated fair value of commitments to extend credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Fair values of standby letters of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements. The fair value of commitments generally approximates the fees received from the customer for issuing such commitments. These fees are not material to the Company s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. 
    
  The following table provides a description of the valuation technique, unobservable input, and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs for the Company s assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016 and 2015  :

Management believes that the credit risk adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value is indicative of the nonperformance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current market conditions, that is, the inactive market. Management attributes the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures during the period to market changes in the nonperformance expectations and pricing of this type of debt, and not as a result of changes to our entity-specific credit risk. The narrowing of the credit risk adjusted spread above the Company s contractual spreads has primarily contributed to the negative fair value adjustments. Generally, an increase in the  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

credit risk adjusted spread and/or a decrease in the three month LIBOR swap curve will result in positive fair value adjustments (and decrease the fair value measurement).  Conversely, a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and/or an increase in the three month LIBOR swap curve will result in negative fair value adjustments (and increase the fair value measurement).

    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had goodwill in the amount of   $4,488,000   in connection with various business combinations and purchases.  This amount was unchanged from the balance of   $4,488,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  While goodwill is not amortized, the Company does conduct periodic impairment analysis on goodwill at least annually or more often as conditions require. 
    
  Goodwill:   The largest component of goodwill is related to the Legacy Bank merger (Campbell reporting unit) completed during February 2007 and totaled approximately   $2.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The Company completed a "Step 0" analysis for the Campbell reporting unit as of   March 31, 2016   and March 31, 2015, with   no   goodwill impairment. 
    
  Under the Step 0 analysis, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.  Determining the fair value involves a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of changes in revenue growth, changes is discount rates, competitive forces within the industry, and other specific industry and market valuation conditions. Based on the results of the Step 0 impairment analysis at   March 31, 2016  , the Company concluded that that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value. Therefore, goodwill was not impaired. 

Subsequent events     are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. Recognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements.  Unrecognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date.  Management has reviewed events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

Item 2  - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
    
  Certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following factors: i) competitive pressures in the banking industry and changes in the regulatory environment; ii) exposure to changes in the interest rate environment and the resulting impact on the Company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities; iii) decline in the health of the economy nationally or regionally which could reduce the demand for loans or reduce the value of real estate collateral securing most of the Company s loans; iv) credit quality deterioration that could cause an increase in the provision for loan losses; v) Asset/Liability matching risks and liquidity risks; volatility and devaluation in the securities markets, vi) failure to comply with the regulatory agreements under which the Company is subject, vii) expected cost savings from recent acquisitions are not realized, and, viii) potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Therefore, the information set forth therein should be carefully considered when evaluating the business prospects of the Company. For additional information concerning risks and uncertainties related to the Company and its operations, please refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  United Security Bancshares (the  Company  or  Holding Company") is a California corporation incorporated during March of 2001 and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. United Security Bank (the  Bank ) is a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of the Company and was formed in 1987. References to the Company are references to United Security Bancshares (including the Bank). References to the Bank are to United Security Bank, while references to the Holding Company are to the parent only, United Security Bancshares. The Company currently has eleven banking branches, which provide financial services in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara counties in the state of California. 
    
  On March 23, 2010, United Security Bancshares (the "Company") and its wholly owned subsidiary, United Security Bank (the "Bank"), entered into a formal written agreement (the  Agreement ) with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the  Federal Reserve ) as a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Institutions (the  DFI ) in June 2009.  That examination found significant increases in nonperforming assets, both classified loans and OREO, during 2008 and 2009, and heightened concerns about the Bank s use of brokered and other wholesale funding sources to fund loan growth, which created increased risk to equity capital and potential volatility in earnings.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company and the Bank agreed, among other things: to maintain a sound process for determining, documenting, and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses; to improve the management of the Bank's liquidity position and funds management policies; to maintain sufficient capital at the Company and Bank level; and to improve the Bank s earnings and overall condition.  The Company and Bank also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt, purchase or redeem any shares of stock, declare or pay any cash dividends, or pay interest on the Company's junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities, without prior written approval from the Federal Reserve.  The Company generates no revenue of its own and, as such, relies on dividends from the Bank to pay its operating expenses and interest payments on the Company s junior subordinated debt.  Effective November 19, 2014, the Federal Reserve terminated the Agreement with the Bank and the Company and replaced it with an informal supervisory agreement that requires, among other things, obtaining written approval from the Federal Reserve prior to the payment of dividends from the Bank to the Company or the payment of dividends by the Company or interest on the Company s junior subordinated debt.  The inability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to the Company may hinder the Company s ability to meet its ongoing operating obligations. (  For more information on the Agreement see the  Regulatory Matters  section included in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  ) 
    
  On May 20, 2010, the DFI (now known as the Department of Business Oversight (the  DBO )) issued a formal written order (the  Order ) pursuant to  a consent agreement with the Bank as a result of the same June 2009 joint regulatory examination.  The terms of the Order were essentially similar to the Federal Reserve s Agreement, except for a few additional requirements.  On September 24, 2013, the Bank entered into an informal Memorandum of Understanding (the  MOU ) with the DBO and on October 15, 2013, the Order was terminated.  The Order and the MOU require the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholder s equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than   9.0%   and also requires the DBO s approval for the Bank to pay a dividend to the Company.  Accordingly, reflecting the Company s and the Bank s improved financial condition and performance, as of November 19, 2014, the Bank and the Company have been relieved of all formal regulatory agreements.  Some of the governance and procedures established by the Agreement and the Order remain in place, including submission of certain plans and reports to the Federal Reserve and DBO, the Bank s obligation to maintain a 9.0% tangible shareholder s equity ratio, and the requirement to seek approvals from the Federal Reserve and the DBO for either the Bank or the Company

to pay dividends and for the Company to pay interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debt.  Effective October 19, 2016, the DBO terminated the MOU as the Bank had fulfilled the provisions of the MOU. 
  (  For more information on the Agreement see the  Regulatory Matters  section included in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  ) 
    
  Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Position 
    
  The Company s overall operations are impacted by a number of factors, including not only interest rates and margin spreads, which impact the results of operations, but also the composition of the Company s balance sheet.  One of the primary strategic goals of the Company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk, and to finance those assets with a low-cost and stable source of funds.  Liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth.  
    
  Since the Bank primarily conducts banking operations in California s Central Valley, its operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic condition of the Central Valley.  Our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in the Central Valley, and declines in economic conditions can have adverse material effects upon the Bank.  In addition, the Central Valley remains largely dependent on agriculture.  A downturn in agriculture and agricultural related business could indirectly and adversely affect the Company as many borrowers and customers are involved in, or are impacted to some extent, by the agricultural industry. While a great number of our borrowers are not directly involved in agriculture, they would likely be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry since many jobs in our market areas are ancillary to the regular production, processing, marketing and sale of agricultural commodities. The state of California is currently experiencing the worst drought in recorded history, and, of course, it is not possible to predict the potential impact on businesses and consumers located in the Company's market areas or the duration of the drought. 
    
  The residential real estate markets in the five county region from Merced to Kern has strengthened since 2013 and that trend has continued into the   third quarter   of   2016  . The severe declines in residential construction and home prices that began in 2008 have ended and home prices are now rising on a year-over-year basis. The sustained period of double-digit price declines from 2008 2011 adversely impacted the Company s operations and increased the levels of nonperforming assets, increased expenses related to foreclosed properties, and decreased profit margins. As the Company continues its business development and expansion efforts throughout its market areas, it will also maintain its commitment to the reduction of nonperforming assets and provision of options for borrowers experiencing difficulties.  Those options include combinations of rate and term concessions, as well as forbearance agreements with borrowers.  
    
  The Company continues to emphasize relationship banking and core deposit growth, and has focused greater attention on its market area of Fresno, Madera, and Kern Counties, as well as Campbell, in Santa Clara County. The San Joaquin Valley and other California markets are exhibiting stronger demand for construction lending and commercial lending from small and medium size businesses, as commercial and residential real estate markets have shown improvements. 

Results of Operations 
    
  On a year-to-date basis, the Company reported net income of   $5,830,000   or   $0.35   per share (  $0.35   diluted) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $5,177,000   or   $0.31   per share (  $0.31   diluted) for the same period in   2015  . The Company s return on average assets was   1.04%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   1.01%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The Company s return on average equity was   8.38%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   8.10%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  For the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company reported net income of   $2,040,000   or   $0.12   per share (  $0.12   diluted) and   $1,886,000   or   $0.11   per share (  $0.11    diluted), respectively.  The Company s return on average assets was   1.07%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.16%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Bank s return on average equity was   8.53%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   9.38%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    

(1) 
    Loan amounts include nonaccrual loans, but the related interest income has been included only if collected for the period prior to the loan being placed on a nonaccrual basis. Loan interest income includes loan costs of approximately $169,000 and loan fees of $60,000 for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Interest income/expense is divided by actual number of days in the period times 365 days in the yield calculation

    Yields on investments securities are calculated based on average amortized cost balances rather than fair value, as changes in fair value are reflected as a component of shareholders' equity. 
       
  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , total interest income   increase  d   $794,000   or   11.41%  , as compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Comparing those two periods, average interest earning assets   increase  d   $60,269,000  , with a   $74,363,000   increase in loans and leases and   $20,374,000   in investment securities, partially offset by a   $34,475,000   decrease on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank.  The average yield on total interest-earning assets   increase  d   8   basis points, primarily due to a decrease in overnight balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, which are a lower yielding asset compared to loans and investments.  Yields on interest bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank and other banks increased for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of the 0.25% interest rate increase effective December 2015.   
    
  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , total interest expense   increase  d   $23,000   or   7.06%   as compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of a   $16,484,000     increase   in interest-bearing liabilities.  The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was   0.36%   for both quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Both the Company's net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as "volume change." Both are also affected by changes in yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as "rate change." The following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the periods indicated. 
    
  Table 2.  Rate and Volume Analysis 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total interest income   increase  d approximately   $1,355,000   or   6.66%   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Earning asset volumes for loans and leases increased   $43,248,000   on average. Available for sale investment securities   increase  d   $3,009,000   and overnight investments with the FRB   increase  d   $16,782,000   between the two periods. The average rates on loans   decrease  d   17   basis points between the two periods, and the average rate on investment securities   increase  d approximately   7   basis points during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of 2015.   
    
  The overall average yield on the loan portfolio was   5.20%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   5.37%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The Company has successfully sought to mitigate the low-interest rate environment with loan floors included in new and renewed loans when practical.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   44.3%   of the Company's loan portfolio consisted of floating rate instruments, as compared to 43.2% of the portfolio at   December 31, 2015  , with the majority of those tied to the prime rate. Approximately   30.2%   or $  74,942,000   of the floating rate loans had rate floors at   September 30, 2016  , making them effectively fixed-rate loans for certain increases in interest rates, and fixed-rate loans for all decreases in interest rates. Approximately $  735,000   of the $  74,942,000   in loans with floors have floor spreads of 100 basis points or more, meaning that  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

interest rates would need to increase more than 1% (or 100 basis points) before the rates on those loans would increase and effectively become floating rate loans again. Of the $  74,942,000   in loans which comprise floating rate loans with floors,   $300,000   will mature in one year or less. 
    
  Although market rates of interest are at historically low levels, the Company s disciplined deposit pricing efforts have helped keep the Company's cost of funds low.  The Company s net interest margin   decrease  d to   4.10%   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , when compared to   4.25%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The net interest margin has declined due to declines in the the loan portfolio yield in addition to growth in overnight balances with the Federal Reserve Bank, which is a lower yielding asset.  The prime rate was raised from 3.25% to 3.50% in December 2015.  The Company s average cost of funds remained relatively stable at   0.36%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   0.35%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Since the Company does not intend to increase its current level of brokered deposits, the level of brokered deposits is expected to remain relatively constant at least in the short-term.  Currently CDARs reciprocal deposits are the only brokered deposits in the Company.  CDARs reciprocal deposits are preferred by some depositors. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total interest expense   increase  d approximately   $58,000  , or   6.07%   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Between those two periods, average interest-bearing liabilities   increase  d by   $14,602,000  . 
    
  Net interest income has   increase  d between the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , totaling   $20,681,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $19,384,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in net interest income between   2015   and   2016   was primarily the result of reinvestment of low yielding overnight investments into the loan and investment portfolios and growth in total interest-earning assets.  
    
  The following table summarizes the year-to-date averages of the components of interest-earning assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets and the components of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities: 

Table 3. Changes in Noninterest Income 
    
  The following tables sets forth the amount and percentage changes in the categories presented for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  :

Noninterest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $141,000   or   3.60%   when compared to the same period of   2015  . Customer service fees, the primary component of noninterest income,   increase  d   $206,000   or   7.74%   between the two periods presented. The   decrease   in noninterest income of   $141,000   between the two periods is primarily the result of a   $48,000   gain recorded on the fair value of a financial liability for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to a   $346,000   gain on the fair value of a financial liability recorded for the same period in 2015.  The change in the fair value of financial liability was primarily caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve. 
    
  The cost of the Company s subordinated debentures issued by USB Capital Trust II has remained low as market rates have remained low during the   first nine months of 2016  .  With pricing at 3-month-LIBOR plus 129 basis points, the effective cost of the subordinated debt was 2.15% at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to 1.90% at December 31, 2015.  Pursuant to fair value accounting guidance, the Company has recorded   $48,000   in pretax fair value   gain   on its junior subordinated debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , bringing the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt to   $4,262,000   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Noninterest income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $663,000   to   $786,000  , compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   decrease   is mostly attributed to a loss on the fair value of financial liability of   $423,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a gain on fair value of financial liability of   $148,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The fluctuation in fair value of financial liability was caused by flattening of the LIBOR yield curve.  
    
  Noninterest Expense 
    
  The following table sets forth the amount and percentage changes in the categories presented for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 
    
  Table 4. Changes in Noninterest Expense

     Table of Contents  

Noninterest expense   increase  d approximately   $584,000   or   4.05%   between the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . The   increase   experienced during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily the result of   increase  s of   $548,000   in employee salary and benefit expenses,   $191,000   in occupancy expense, and   $239,000   in professional fees, partially offset by a   $378,000     decrease   in OREO expense.  The   increase   in employee salary and benefit expenses is driven by increases in group insurance and higher employee incentives, compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Noninterest expense for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $150,000   to   $4,864,000  , compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   decrease   was attributed to lower OREO expenses and a reduction in regulatory assessment expense.  The FDIC assessment rate was reduced effective third quarter 2016 as the FDIC minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 was reached.  OREO expenses   decrease  d   $362,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of partial sales on two OREO properties. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s income tax expense is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income reported for tax purposes, as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the Company s pretax income or loss shown in the statements of operations and comprehensive income.  As pretax income or loss amounts become smaller, the impact of these differences become more significant and are reflected as variances in the Company s effective tax rate for the periods presented.  In general, the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the Company s statements of income and comprehensive income. 
    
  The Company reviews its current tax positions at least quarterly based accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes which includes the criteria that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity s financial statements.  Under the income tax guidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is   more likely than not   that the position will be sustained on examination.  The term  more likely than not  means a likelihood of more than 50 percent.   In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority.

Commercial real estate loans amounted to   35.30%  ,   35.43%  , and   32.01%  , of the total loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Residential mortgage loans are not generally not originated by the Company, but some residential mortgage loans have been made over the past several years to facilitate take-out loans for construction borrowers when they were not able to obtain permanent financing elsewhere. These loans are generally 30-year amortizing loans with maturities of between three and five years. Residential mortgages totaled   $91,852,000   or   16.41%   of the portfolio at   September 30, 2016  ,   $68,811,000  , or   13.35%   of the portfolio at   December 31, 2015  , and   $72,452,000   or   14.05%   of the portfolio at   September 30, 2015  .

All lines of credit are on an  as available  basis and can be revoked by the grantor at any time. At   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company had no outstanding borrowings. The Company had collateralized FRB lines of credit of   $302,456,000  , collateralized FHLB lines of credit totaling   $2,854,000  , an uncollateralized line of credit with PCBB of   $10,000,000  , and an uncollateralized line of credit with Zions Bank of   $20,000,000   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  Lending money is the Company's principal business activity, and ensuring appropriate evaluation, diversification, and control of credit risks is a primary management responsibility.  Losses are implicit in lending activities and the amount of such losses will vary, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers. 
    
  The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit.  The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans and commitments to extend credit; including current economic conditions, past credit experience, collateral, and concentrations of credit.  There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio.  The conclusion that a loan may become uncollectible, either in part or in whole is subjective and contingent upon economic, environmental, and other conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty.  When determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company follows, in accordance with GAAP, the guidelines set forth in the Revised Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ( Statement ) issued by banking regulators in December 2006.  The Statement is a revision of the previous guidance released in July 2001, and outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification, past due status, type of loan, industry or collateral.  It also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio, and updates previous guidance that describes the responsibilities of the board of directors, management, and bank examiners regarding the allowance for credit losses.  Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 was released during July 2001, and represents the SEC staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the Commission s interpretations.  It is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, as well as a general or formula-based component. The Company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven (11) segments, primarily by loan class and type, that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under the formula-based component of the allowance. Those loans which are determined to be impaired under current accounting guidelines are not subject to the formula-based reserve analysis, and evaluated individually for specific impairment under the asset-specific component of the allowance. 
    
  The Company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements, which include: 
    
  - the formula allowance 
  - specific allowances for problem graded loans identified as impaired 
  - and the unallocated allowance 
    
  The formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments.  Loss factors are based on the Company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and, may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.  Factors that may affect collectability of the loan portfolio include:

    Trends in volumes and term of loans; 
                
    Effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting, collection, charge-off, and recovery;

    National and local economic trends and conditions and; 
                
    Concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio, including high-balance loan concentrations and participations. 
       
  Management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans (substandard, doubtful, and loss), special mention loans, and pass graded loans, based on a loss migration model.  The migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the previous quarters as determined by management (time horizons adjusted as business cycles or environment changes) and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the Company s loan portfolio.  For purposes of this analysis, loans are grouped by internal risk classifications and categorized as pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.  Certain loans are homogeneous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade. These homogeneous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans. Special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak, as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends which, if not corrected, could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrades.  Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses which, if not corrected, could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt. A loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable.  Classified loans, as defined by the Company, include impaired loans and loans categorized as substandard, doubtful, and loss which are not considered impaired.  At   September 30, 2016  , impaired and classified loans totaled   $30,671,000  , or 5.5%, of gross loans as compared to   $39,579,000   or 7.7% of gross loans at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the Company s portfolio, with an additional participation factor added, if required, for specific risks associated with participations.  In general, participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the Company, and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well-being of the underlying agent bank. 
    
  Specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in impaired loans.  For impaired loans, specific allowances are determined based on the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the net present value of the anticipated cash flows, or the market value of the underlying assets.  Formula allowances for classified loans, excluding impaired loans, are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole.  The specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan, as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics, based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis. 
    
  The unallocated portion of the allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.  The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the specific allowance, formula allowance, and unallocated allowance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , as well as classified loans at those period-ends. 

Impaired loans decreased   $7,926,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   and the specific allowance related to impaired loans   decrease  d   $1,727,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease in impaired loans is primarily due to paydowns on troubled debt restructures and loan charge-offs. The formula allowance related to classified and special mention unimpaired loans   increase  d by   $36,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  .  The unallocated allowance increased from   $70,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $570,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in unallocated allowance is the result of declining historical loss factors and a decrease in specific allowance on impaired loans.  While economic conditions have improved and there has been a corresponding reduction in required loss reserves, the Company has a concentration in loans to finance CRE, construction and land development activities not secured by real estate. These loans have inherently higher risk characteristics and management believes maintaining additional, unallocated reserves to address the inherent losses in these loans that is not reflected in the Company's ALLL methodology is reasonable and appropriate. Further, the level of unallocated reserve is within the Company's policy limits.  The level of  pass  loans   increase  d approximately   $52,527,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  .  The related formula allowance   increase  d   $396,000   during the same period. The formula allowance for  pass loans  is derived from the loan loss factors under migration analysis.  
    
  The Company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses. The specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self-correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio. By analyzing the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis, management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available. In performing the periodic migration analysis, management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the Company s loan portfolio. There are a number of other factors which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors. Those factors include 1) trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, 2) trends in loan volume and terms, 3) effects of changes in lending policies, 4) concentrations of credit, 5) competition, 6) national and local economic trends and conditions, 7) experience of lending staff, 8) loan review and Board of Directors oversight, 9) high balance loan concentrations, and 10) other business conditions.  
    
  The general reserve requirements (ASC 450-70) decreased with the continued strengthening of local, state, and national economies and their impact on our local lending base, which has resulted in a lower qualitative component for the general reserve calculation.  These positive factors were partially offset by the Company including OREO financial results in loss history and extending the look back period used to capture the loss history for the quantitative portion of the ALLL.  In the third quarter of 2013, the look back period was changed from 4 years to stake-in-the-ground (December 31, 2005), in an effort to include higher losses experienced during the credit crisis.  Changes in the mix of historical losses in the look back period resulted in a reallocation of the general reserve component of the allowance amount within the various loan segments as compared to   September 30, 2016  , as loss experience by segment has fluctuated over time.  The stake-in-the-ground methodology requires the Company to use December 31, 2005, as the starting point of the look back period to capture loss

history.  Time horizons are subject to Management's assessment of the current period, taking into consideration changes in business cycles and environment changes.   
    
  Management and the Company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly/monthly basis. The Company s Loan Committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the Company, and to keep the Board of Directors informed through committee minutes. All special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on Problem Asset Reports and Impaired Loan Reports and are reviewed by senior management. Migration analysis and impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary. The Board of Directors is kept abreast of any changes or trends in problem assets on a monthly basis, or more often if required.  
    
  The specific allowance for impaired loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section. The primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are: i) all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, construction loans, and agricultural loans, and ii) impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but may also include problem loans other than delinquent loans. 
    
  The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it believes it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructures, and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected. Management bases the measurement of these impaired loans either on the fair value of the loan's collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan's stated interest rates. Cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision, if applicable. 
    
  In most cases, the Company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans. In the case of certain troubled debt restructuring, for which the loan has been performing for a prescribed period of time under the current contractual terms, income is recognized under the accrual method.  At   September 30, 2016  , included in impaired loans, were troubled debt restructures totaling   $11,191,000  .  Nonaccrual loans, totaling   $7,365,000  , were included in that balance. The remaining troubled debt restructures, totaling   $3,826,000  , were current with regards to payments, and were performing according to their modified contractual terms. 
    
  The largest category of impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   was commercial and industrial loans, comprising approximately   33.72%   of total impaired loans.  Real estate construction loans and real estate mortgage loans represented approximately   32.44%   and   27.70%  , respectively, of total impaired loan balances at   September 30, 2016  .  Of the   $5,312,000   in commercial and industrial impaired loans reported at   September 30, 2016  , two loans, with a total recorded investment of $558,000, were secured by real estate. Specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information, economic trends within geographic markets, loan-to-value ratios, and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral.  Adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors. Of total impaired loans at   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $11,082,000  , or   70.3%  , are secured by real estate. The majority of impaired real estate construction and development loans are for the purpose of residential construction, residential and commercial acquisition and development, and land development.  Residential construction loans are made for the purpose of building residential 1-4 single family homes. Residential and commercial acquisition and development loans are made for the purpose of purchasing land, developing that land if required, and developing real estate or commercial construction projects on those properties.  Land development loans are made for the purpose of converting raw land into construction-ready building sites.  The following table summarizes the components of impaired loans and their related specific reserves at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Included in impaired loans are loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in an attempt to maximize collection.  The Company makes various types of concessions when structuring TDRs including rate reductions, payment extensions, and forbearance.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $3,870,000   of the total   $11,191,000   in TDRs was comprised of real estate mortgages.  An additional   $5,109,000   was related to real estate construction and development loans.  Reserve amounts for real estate construction and development impaired loans and impaired installment loans declined between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the Company securing collateral on loan which previously had reserve amounts allocated to them. 
    
  Total troubled debt restructurings   decrease  d   39.53%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  Nonaccrual TDRs   decrease  d by   1.54%   while accruing TDRs   decrease  d by   65.31%   over the same period. Within TDR categories, total residential mortgages and real estate construction TDRs showed a   decrease   of   47.01%  .  Many of these credits are related to real estate projects that slowed significantly or stalled during the recession, leading the Company to pursue restructuring of the qualified credits allowing the real estate market time to recover and developers opportunity to finish projects at a slower pace. Concessions granted in these circumstances include lengthened maturities and/or rate reductions that enabled the borrower to finish the projects and may be entirely successful. In large part, current successes are related to a recovering real estate market. 
    
  The following table summarizes TDRs by type, classified separately as nonaccrual or accrual, which are included in impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Of the   $11,191,000   in total TDRs at   September 30, 2016  ,   $7,365,000   were on nonaccrual status at period-end.  Of the   $18,508,000   in total TDRs at   December 31, 2015  ,   $7,480,000   were on nonaccrual status at period-end. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has no commercial real estate (CRE) workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans (i.e., A Note/B Note structure). 
    
  For a restructured loan to return to accrual status there needs to be at least 6 months successful payment history. In addition, the Company s Credit Administration performs a financial analysis of the credit to determine whether the borrower has the ability to continue to perform successfully over the remaining life of the loan. This includes, but is not limited to, a review of financial statements and a cash flow analysis of the borrower. Only after determining that the borrower has the ability to perform under the terms of the loans will the restructured credit be considered for accrual status. 
    
  Table 7. Nonperforming Assets 

Non-performing loans   decrease  d   $7,648,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in restructured loans is primarily due to primarily due to principal paydowns and loan charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans   decrease  d   $446,000   between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , with real estate mortgage and real estate construction loans comprising approximately   80.20%   of total nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased from   50.53%   at   December 31, 2015   to   77.06%   at   September 30, 2016  .

Loans past due more than 30 days receive increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk. The Company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in an ongoing effort to recognize and address loan problems as early and most effectively as possible. As impaired loans, nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly. 
    
  Except for the nonaccrual loans included in the above table, or those included in the impaired loan totals, there were no loans at   September 30, 2016   where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the Company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual, past due, or restructured loan at some future date. 
    
  Nonperforming assets, which are primarily related to the real estate loan and other real estate owned portfolio, remained relatively high compared to peers during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , but decreased   $13,456,000   from a balance of   $32,094,000   at   December 31, 2015   to a balance of   $18,638,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  Nonaccrual loans, totaling   $7,747,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $446,000   from the balance of   $8,193,000   reported at   December 31, 2015  .  In determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans, management monitors trends within specific geographical areas, loan-to-value ratios, appraisals, and other credit issues related to the specific loans.  Impaired loans decreased   $7,926,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to a balance of   $15,753,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  Other real estate owned through foreclosure decreased to a balance of   $7,065,000   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to a balance of    $12,873,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in other real estate owned is a result of sales on three other real estate owned properties. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets   decrease  d from   4.42%   at   December 31, 2015   to   2.38%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following table summarizes various nonperforming components of the loan portfolio, the related allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses for the periods shown. 

Management continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of further deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the allowance for loan losses required to cover identified losses in the loan portfolio. Greater focus has been placed on monitoring and reducing the level of problem assets, while working with borrowers to find more options, including loan restructures, to work through these difficult economic times. Restructured loan balances are comprised of   28   loans totaling   $11,191,000   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   29   loans totaling   $18,508,000   at   December 31, 2015  .

The Company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area and other geographical areas in which it does business, which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio.  The Company continues to experience increased competition from major banks, local independents and non-bank institutions which creates pressure on loan pricing.   Low interest rates and a weak economy continue to dominate, even though real estate prices show signs of stabilization.  The Company continues to place increased emphasis on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and the level of losses on the disposition of these assets.  It is in the best interest of both the Company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure in an effort to reduce the impacts on the real estate market.  As part of this strategy, the Company has increased its level of troubled debt restructurings, when it makes economic sense.  While business and consumer spending show improvement in recent quarters, current GDP remains anemic.  It is difficult to forecast what impact the Federal Reserve actions to hold rates low will have on the economy. Local unemployment rates in the San Joaquin Valley have 
  improved, but remain elevated compared with other regions and historically are higher as a result of the area's agricultural 
  dynamics. The Company believes that the Central San Joaquin Valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and 
  housing costs remain low relative to other areas of the state. Management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the 
  Company's exposure to local and worldwide economic conditions, as well as potentially volatile real estate markets, and takes 
  these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of the Company's allowance for possible credit losses, provisions made to that allowance, and charge-off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

Table 8. Allowance for Credit Losses - Summary of Activity 

Provisions for credit losses are determined on the basis of management's periodic credit review of the loan portfolio, consideration of past loan loss experience, current and future economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. Management believes its estimate of the allowance for credit losses adequately covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio and, based on the condition of the loan portfolio, management believes the allowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the recovery of provision for the allowance for credit losses was   $7,000   as compared to a provision of   $434,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Net loan and lease charge-offs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $788,000   as compared to net recoveries of   $368,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The Company charged-off, or had partial charge-offs on,   11   loans during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   5   loans during the same period ended   September 30, 2015  , and   9   loans during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The annualized percentage net charge-offs to average loans were   0.20%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    and 0.21% for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as compared to net recoveries of   0.10%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The Company's net loans   increase  d from   $515,846,000   at   September 30, 2015   to   $560,651,000   at   September 30, 2016  , however the Company did not record a provision to the allowance for credit losses during that period.  Management evaluates its estimate of the allowance for credit losses quarterly and believes it adequately covers the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  
    
  Growth in the loan portfolio during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   brought the allowance to   1.59%   of outstanding loan balances at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   1.88%   of outstanding loan balances at   December 31, 2015  , and   2.24%   at   September 30, 2015  .

At   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , $316,000 and $315,000, respectively, of the formula allowance is allocated to unfunded loan commitments and is, therefore, reported separately in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Management believes that the   1.59%   credit loss allowance at   September 30, 2016   is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, regarding economic conditions or other circumstances which may adversely affect the Company's service areas and result in future losses to the loan portfolio. 

Asset/Liability Management   Liquidity and Cash Flow 
    
  The primary function of asset/liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill financial obligations, including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals, without straining the Company s equity structure. To maintain an adequate liquidity position, the Company relies on, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, cash inflows from deposits and short-term borrowings, repayments of principal on loans and investments, and interest income received. The Company's principal cash outflows are for loan origination, purchases of investment securities, depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses. 
    
  The Company continues to emphasize liability management as part of its overall asset/liability strategy. Through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings, the Company has, when needed, been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while, at the same time, better utilizing its capital resources, and better controlling interest rate risk.  This does not preclude the Company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but, with favorable borrowing rates, the Company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund. If, at some time, rate spreads become unfavorable, the Company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and, either control asset growth or fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no borrowings, as its deposit base currently provides funding sufficient to support its asset values. 
    
  The Company's liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell ( reverse repos ) and investment securities, is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur. Additional liquidity requirements may be funded with overnight or term borrowing arrangements with various correspondent banks, FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank. Within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets. This is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans, which historically have represented the Company's highest yielding asset. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   71.73%   of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of   83.36%  , as compared to   71.02%   of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of   82.87%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Liquid assets at   September 30, 2016  , include cash and cash equivalents totaling   $111,747,000   as compared to   $125,751,000   at   December 31, 2015  . Other sources of liquidity include collateralized lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank, and from the Federal Reserve Bank totaling   $339,425,000   and an uncollateralized lines of credit from Pacific Coast Banker's Bank (PCBB) of   $10,000,000   and Zion's Bank of   $20,000,000   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The liquidity of the parent company, United Security Bancshares, is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary, United Security Bank, subject to limitations imposed by the Financial Code of the State of California.  The Bank currently has limited ability to pay dividends or make capital distributions (see Dividends section included in Regulatory Matters of this Management s Discussion).  The limited ability of the Bank to pay dividends may impact the ability of the Company to fund its ongoing liquidity requirements including ongoing operating expenses, as well as quarterly interest payments on the Company s junior subordinated debt (Trust Preferred Securities.)  Beginning the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the Bank precluded from paying a cash dividend to the Company. To conserve cash and capital resources, the Company 
  elected at March 31, 2009 to defer the payment of interest on its junior subordinated debt beginning with the quarterly payment 
  due October 1, 2009. Since the second quarter of 2014, the Bank has received approval quarterly from the Federal Reserve Bank to upstream a dividend to the parent company for the purpose of payment of interest on the Company's junior 
  subordinated debt and for the parent company's operating expenses.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $316,000   in cash dividends from the Bank.

  The Company has the ability to increase or decrease loan growth, increase or decrease deposits and borrowings, or a combination of both to manage balance sheet liquidity. 

Regulatory Matters 
    
  Regulatory Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
    
  On March 23, 2010, United Security Bancshares (the "Company") and its wholly owned subsidiary, United Security Bank (the "Bank"), entered into a formal written agreement (the  Agreement ) with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the  Federal Reserve ) as a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Institutions (the  DFI ) in June 2009.  That examination found significant increases in nonperforming assets, both classified loans and OREO, during 2008 and 2009, and heightened concerns about the Bank s use of brokered and other wholesale funding sources to fund loan growth, which created increased risk to equity capital and potential volatility in earnings.   
    
  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company and the Bank agreed, among other things: to maintain a sound process for determining, documenting, and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses; to improve the management of the Bank's liquidity position and funds management policies; to maintain sufficient capital at the Company and Bank level; and to improve the Bank s earnings and overall condition.  The Company and Bank also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt, purchase or redeem any shares of stock, declare or pay any cash dividends, or pay interest on the Company's junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities, without prior written approval from the Federal Reserve.  The Company generates no revenue of its own and, as such, relies on dividends from the Bank to pay its operating expenses and interest payments on the Company s junior subordinated debt.   
    
  Effective November 19, 2014, the Federal Reserve terminated the Agreement with the Bank and the Company and replaced it with an informal supervisory agreement that requires, among other things, obtaining written approval from the Federal Reserve prior to the payment of dividends from the Bank to the Company or the payment of dividends by the Company or interest on the Company s junior subordinated debt.  The inability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to the Company may hinder the Company s ability to meet its ongoing operating obligations. 
    
  Accordingly, reflecting the Company s and the Bank s improved financial condition and performance, as of November 19, 2014, the Bank and the Company have been relieved of all formal regulatory agreements.  Some of the governance and procedures established by the Agreement remain in place, including submission of certain plans and reports to the Federal Reserve, the Bank s obligation to maintain a 9.0% tangible shareholder s equity ratio, and the requirement to seek approvals  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

from the Federal Reserve for either the Bank or the Company to pay dividends and for the Company to pay interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debt. While no assurances can be given as to future regulatory approvals, since June 2014, the Federal Reserve has been approving the Bank's payment of dividends to the Company to cover the Company's tax payments, operating expenses, interest payments, and the Company's payment of quarterly interest on the junior subordinated debt. 
    
  Management believes that the Bank is currently in substantial compliance with most of the requirements of the MOU, including its deadlines, and the Bank is working with the FRB to address the few open items. 
    
  Regulatory Order from the California Department of Business Oversight 
    
  On May 20, 2010, the DFI (now known as the Department of Business Oversight (the  DBO )) issued a formal written order (the  Order ) pursuant to  a consent agreement with the Bank as a result of the same June 2009 joint regulatory examination.  The terms of the Order were essentially similar to the Federal Reserve s Agreement, except for a few additional requirements.    
    
  On September 24, 2013, the Bank entered into an informal Memorandum of Understanding (the  MOU ) with the DBO and on October 15, 2013, the Order was terminated.  The MOU requires the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholder s equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than   9.0%   and also requires the DBO s approval for the Bank to pay a dividend to the Company. 
    
  Effective October 19, 2016, the DBO terminated the MOU as the Bank had fulfilled the provisions of the MOU. 
    
  Capital Adequacy 
    
  The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Board of Governors ).  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the consolidated Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by the capital adequacy guidelines require insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (the sum of common stockholders' equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, minus intangible assets, identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries, plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities) to total assets.  Institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of   3%   of Tier 1 capital to total assets.  All other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis points above the   3%   minimum requirement. 
    
  In addition to the general capital adequacy guidelines, pursuant to the DBO s MOU the Bank is required to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholder s equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than   9.0%  .  For purposes of the MOU,  tangible shareholders  equity  is defined as shareholders  equity minus intangible assets.  The Bank s ratio of tangible shareholders  equity to total tangible assets was 12.7% and 12.8% at   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
    
   The Company has adopted a capital plan that includes guidelines and trigger points to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at the Bank and the Company, and that capital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines given the level of classified assets, concentrations of credit, ALLL, current and projected growth, and projected retained earnings.  The capital plan also contains contingency strategies to obtain additional capital as required to fulfill future capital requirements for both the Bank, as a separate legal entity, and the Company on a consolidated basis.   
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s and the Bank's actual capital positions at   September 30, 2016  , as well as the minimum capital requirements and requirements to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions (Bank required only) under the regulatory guidelines discussed above: 
    
  Table 9. Capital Ratios 

60 

     Table of Contents  

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved final capital rules in July 2013, that substantially amend the existing capital rules for banks.  These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (commonly referred to as  Basel III ) as well as requirements encompassed by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
  The final rules set a new common equity tier 1 requirement and higher minimum tier 1 requirements for all banking organizations. They also place limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if a banking organization does not maintain a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above minimum capital requirements. The rules revise the prompt corrective action framework to incorporate the new regulatory capital minimums. They also enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years with the measure of risk-weighted assets. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.  Management believes that, under the current regulations, both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  Dividends paid to shareholders by the Company are subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law.  The California General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal to the amount of the proposed distribution.  The primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the Company from the Bank. 
    
  As noted earlier, the Company and the Bank have entered into an informal agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank and Department of Business Oversight that, among other things, requires prior approval before paying a cash dividend or otherwise making a distribution of stock, increasing debt, repurchasing the Company s common stock, or any other action which would reduce capital of either the Bank or the Company.  In addition, under the agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank, the Company is now prohibited from making interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank. During the year ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s cash dividends of   $316,000   paid to the Company were approved by the Federal Reserve and the DBO.  These dividends partially funded the Company s operating costs and payments of interest on its junior subordinated debentures 
    
  The Bank, as a state-chartered bank, is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in California state banking law and administered by the Commissioner of the California Department of Business Oversight ( Commissioner ).  Under such restrictions, the Bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the Bank or the Bank s net income for the last three fiscal years (less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time).  If the above test is not met, cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the Commissioner, in an amount not exceeding the Bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year.  Such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends, which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  

Commissioner.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commissioner finds that the shareholders  equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound, the Commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend.  The FRB may also limit dividends paid by the Bank.  As noted above, the terms of the informal agreement with the Federal Reserve prohibit both the Company and the Bank from paying dividends without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
    
  Reserve Balances 
    
  The Bank is required to maintain average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank.  During 2005, the Company implemented a deposit reclassification program, which allows the Company to reclassify a portion of transaction accounts to non-transaction accounts for reserve purposes.  The deposit reclassification program is provided by a third-party vendor, and has been approved by the Federal Reserve Bank.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was not subject to a reserve requirement. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
    
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was carried out. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
    
  The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud.  A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
