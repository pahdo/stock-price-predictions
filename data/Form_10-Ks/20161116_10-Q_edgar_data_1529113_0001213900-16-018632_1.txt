Note
1 - Organization and Nature of Business   

Overview

Sysorex
Global ( SG ), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sysorex USA f/k/a Lilien Systems ( SUSA ), Sysorex
Government Services, Inc. ( SGS ), Sysorex Canada Corp. f/k/a. AirPatrol Research Corp. ( Sysorex Canada )
and the majority-owned subsidiary, Sysorex Arabia LLC ( SA ) (Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires,
the terms  Sysorex   we,   us,   our  and the  Company  refer collectively
to Sysorex Global and its above subsidiaries), provides big data analytics and location based products and related services
for the cyber-security and Internet of Things markets. The Company is headquartered in California, and has subsidiary offices
in Virginia, Maryland, Oregon, Hawaii, State of Washington, California, Vancouver, Canada and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   

Liquidity    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficiency of approximately $10.3 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $13.2 million and utilized cash in operations of approximately
$1.1 million.  

On August 9, 2016, the Company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement with Hillair Capital Investments L.P. pursuant to which it issued and sold (i) an 8% Original
Issue Discount Senior Convertible Debenture in an aggregate principal amount of $5,700,000 due on August 9, 2018 and (ii) 2,250
shares of newly created Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Preferred Stock , together
with the Debenture, the  Securities ), for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 (the  Transaction ).
The Company also has a Credit Facility for up to $10 million which we borrow against based on eligible assets with a maturity
date of April 29, 2017 of which approximately $4.4 million is utilized. During the third quarter of 2016 the Company implemented
a cost cutting program that would reduce operating expenses by approximately $1.8 million on an annual basis. 

The Company s capital resources as of
September 30, 2016, increased bank facility, net proceeds from the September 25, 2015 offering and August 9, 2016 convertible
debenture and preferred stock offering, higher margin business line expansion and recent contract awards, including prepayments
anticipated to be received are expected to be sufficient to fund planned operations during the next twelve months from the date
of filing this quarterly report. While the Company also has an effective registration statement on Form S-3 which will allow it
to raise additional capital from the sale of its securities, subject to certain limitations for registrants with a market capitalization
of less than $75 million, if additional financing is needed we anticipate such financing will come from an increase in our bank
facility rather than through a sale of equity, however, our decision will be based on our capital requirements and the terms of
the various types of financing that will be available to us when we need it.  The information in these condensed consolidated
financial statements concerning the Company s Form S-3 registration statement does not constitute an offer of any securities
for sale. If these sources do not provide the capital necessary to fund the Company s operations during the next twelve
months, the Company may need to reduce costs and curtail certain aspects of its expansion activities or consider other means of
obtaining additional financing, although there is no guarantee that any such additional financing would be available to the Company
on an acceptable term, if at all.  

Note
2 - Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of the
Company s operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and footnotes for the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014 included in the Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.

Significant
Accounting Policies    

The
Company's complete accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Company's audited financial statements and footnotes for
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each of the reporting periods.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The Company s significant estimates consist of:  

The
    valuation of stock-based compensation;   

The
    allowance for doubtful accounts;   

The
    valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset; and   

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and goodwill.   

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company provides IT solutions and services to customers and derives revenues primarily from the sale of third-party hardware and
software products, software, assurance, licenses and other consulting services, including maintenance services and recognizes
revenue once the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the price is fixed and
determinable, (3) shipment (software and hardware) or fulfillment (maintenance) has occurred, and (4) there is reasonable assurance
of collection of the sales proceeds (the  Revenue Recognition Criteria ). In addition, the Company also records revenues
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605-45  Principal Agent Consideration 
( ASC 605-45 ). The Company evaluates the sales of products and services on a case by case basis to determine whether
the transaction should be recorded gross or net, including, but not limited to, assessing whether or not the Company: 1) is the
primary obligor in the transaction; 2) has inventory risk with respect to the products and/or services sold; 3) has latitude in
pricing; and 4) changes the product or performs part of the services sold. The Company evaluates whether revenues received from
the sale of hardware and software products, licenses, and services, including maintenance and professional consulting services,
should be recognized on a gross or net basis on a transaction by transaction basis. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has
determined that all revenues received should be recognized on a gross basis in accordance with applicable standards.  

Cooperative
reimbursements from vendors, which are earned and available, are recorded during the period the related transaction has occurred.
Cooperative reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with ASC Topic 605-50  Accounting
by a Customer (including reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.  Provisions for returns are estimated
based on historical collections and credit memo analysis for the period.  The Company receives Marketing Development Funds
(MDF) from vendors based on quarterly or annual sales performance to promote the marketing of vendor products and services. The
Company must file claims with vendors for these cooperative reimbursements by providing invoices and receipts for marketing expenses.
Reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of marketing expenses and other applicable selling general and administrative expenses
ratably over the period in which the expenses are expected to occur. The Company receives vendor rebates which are recorded to
cost of sales.

Revenue
Recognition (continued)    

The
Company also enters into sales transactions whereby customer orders contain multiple deliverables, and reports its multiple deliverable
arrangements under ASC 605-25  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  ( ASC-605-25 ). These
multiple deliverable arrangements primarily consist of the following deliverables: the Company s design, configuration,
installation, integration, warranty/maintenance and consulting services; and third-party computer hardware, software and warranty
maintenance services. In situations where the Company bundles all or a portion of the separate elements, Vendor Specific Objective
Evidence ( VSOE ) is determined based on prices when sold separately.  For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 revenues recognized as a result of customer contracts requiring the delivery of multiple elements was $3.7 million
and $7.4 million, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 revenues recognized as a result of
customer contracts requiring the delivery of multiple elements was $15.4 million and $24.3 million, respectively.  

Hardware,
Software and Licensing Revenue Recognition    

Generally,
the Revenue Recognition Criteria are met with respect to the sales of hardware and software products when they are shipped to
the customer. The delivery of products to our customers occurs in a variety of ways, including (i) as a physical product shipped
from the Company s warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by a third-party vendor, or (iii) via electronic delivery with respect
to software licenses. The Company leverages drop-ship arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products
to customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouse. In such arrangements, the Company negotiates the
sale price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped, bears credit risk of collecting payment from
its customers and is ultimately responsible for the acceptability of the product and ensuring that such product meets the standards
and requirements of the customer. As a result, the Company recognizes the sale of the product and the cost of such upon receiving
notification from the supplier that the product has shipped. Vendor rebates and price protection are recorded when earned as a
reduction to cost of sales or merchandise inventory, as applicable.  Vendor product price discounts are recorded when earned
as a reduction to cost of sales.     

Maintenance
and Professional Services Revenue Recognition    

With
respect to sales of our maintenance, consulting and other service agreements including our digital advertising and electronic
services, the Revenue Recognition Criteria is met once the service has been provided. Revenue on time and material contracts is
recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended. The fixed rate includes direct labor, indirect expenses,
and profits. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed as actual costs and may include markup. Anticipated losses
are recognized as soon as they become known. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did
not incur any such losses. These amounts are based on known and estimated factors. Revenues from time and material or firm fixed
price long-term and short-term contracts are derived principally with various United States Government agencies and commercial
customers.  

The
Company recognizes revenue for sales of all services billed as a fixed fee ratably over the term of the arrangement as such services
are provided. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue
and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period.  Amounts received as prepayments for services to be rendered
are recognized as deferred revenue.  Revenue from such prepayments is recognized when the services are provided.   

The
Company s storage and computing segment maintenance services agreements permit customers to obtain technical support from
the Company and/or the manufacturer and to update, at no additional cost, to the latest technology when new software updates are
introduced and available during the period that the maintenance agreement is in effect. Since the Company assumes certain responsibility
for product staging, configuration, installation, modification, and integration with other client systems, or retains general
inventory risk upon customer return or rejection and is most familiar with the customer and its required specifications, it generally
serves as the initial contact with the customer with respect to any storage and computing maintenance services required and therefore
will perform all or part of the required service.

Note

Revenue
Recognition (continued)    

Typically,
the Company sells maintenance contracts for a separate fee with initial contractual periods ranging from one to three years with
renewal for additional periods thereafter. The Company generally bills maintenance fees in advance and records the amounts received
as deferred revenue with respect to any portion of the fee for which services have not yet been provided. The Company recognizes
the related revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement as services are provided. In situations where the Company
bundles all or a portion of the maintenance fee with products, VSOE for maintenance is determined based on prices when sold separately.  

Customers
that have purchased maintenance/warranty services have a right to cancel and receive a refund of the amounts paid for unused services
at any time during the service period upon advance written notice to the Company. Cancellation and refund privileges with respect
to maintenance/warranty services lapse as to any period during the term of the agreement for which such services have already
been provided. Customers do not have the right to a refund of paid fees for maintenance/warranty services that the Company has
earned and recognized as revenue. Invoices issued for maintenance/warranty services not yet rendered are recorded as deferred
revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the service period. As a result (1) the warranty and maintenance service fees
payable by each customer are separately accounted for in each customer purchase order as a separate line item, and (2) upon the
Company s receipt and acceptance of a request for refund of maintenance/warranty services not yet provided, the Company s
obligation to perform any additional maintenance/warranty services will end. Sales are recorded net of discounts and returns.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company accounts for options granted to employees by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the award of equity
instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant.  The fair value of that award is then ratably recognized
as expense over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for that award.  

Options
and warrants granted to consultants and other non-employees are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and subsequently adjusted
to fair value at the end of each reporting period until such options and warrants vest, and the fair value of such instruments,
as adjusted, is expensed over the related vesting period.  

The
Company incurred stock-based compensation charges, net of estimated forfeitures of $344,000 and $391,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1,055,000 and $885,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 The following table summarizes the nature of such charges for the periods then ended (in thousands):

Note

Net
Loss Per Share    

The
Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Basic and diluted net loss per common share were the same since the inclusion of common shares issuable pursuant
to the exercise of options and warrants in the calculation of diluted net loss per common shares would have been anti-dilutive.  

The
following table summarizes the number of common shares and common share equivalents excluded from the calculation of diluted net
loss per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Preferred Stock    

The Company applies the accounting standards
for distinguishing liabilities from equity under U.S. GAAP when determining the classification and measurement of its convertible
preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair
value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s
control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as permanent equity. 

As of the issuance date, the carrying amount
of the preferred stock was less than the redemption value. If the Company were to determine that redemption was probable, the
carrying value would be increased by periodic accretions so that the carrying value would equal the redemption amount at the earliest
redemption date. Such accretion would be recorded as a preferred stock dividend. 

Derivative Liabilities    

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued a convertible debenture that included reset provisions considered to be down-round protection. The
Company determined that the conversion feature is a derivative instrument pursuant to FASB ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging. 
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company bifurcate the conversion feature and record
it as a liability at the fair value and mark-to-market the instrument at fair value as of each balance sheet date. Any change in
fair value is recorded as a change in the fair value of derivative liabilities for each reporting period. The fair value of the
conversion feature was determined using the Binomial Lattice model. The Company reassesses the classification at each balance sheet
date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the
event that caused the reclassification. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers,  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 - Revenue
Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the ASC. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting
period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial
application. To allow entities additional time to implement systems, gather data and resolve implementation questions, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, in August 2015, to
defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for one year, which is fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements or disclosures. In addition, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-08 in March 2016, to help provide interpretive clarifications on the new guidance in ASC Topic 606. The Company
is currently evaluating the accounting, transition, and disclosure requirements of the standard to determine the impact, if any,
on its financial statements or disclosures.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements (continued)    

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations.  This update provides clarifying guidance
regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers when another party, along with the reporting
entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. In these circumstances, an entity is required to determine
whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to
arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). The amendments
in the Update clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The update is effective, along with
ASU 2014-09, for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-08 is not expected to have
a material impact on its financial statements or disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires an entity to
simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-09 and its
impact on its financial statements or disclosures. 

On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-12 provides clarifying guidance
in a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for this
ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. The Company is evaluating the effect of ASU
2014-09, if any, on its financial statements or disclosures. 

The FASB and the SEC have issued certain accounting
standards updates and regulations that will become effective in subsequent periods; however, management of the Company does not
believe that any of those updates would have significantly affected the Company s financial accounting measures or disclosures
had they been in effect during 2016 or 2015, and does not believe that any of those pronouncements will have a significant impact
on the Company s consolidated financial statements at the time they become effective. 

Subsequent Events   

The Company evaluates events and/or transactions
occurring after the balance sheet date and before the issue date of the condensed consolidated financial statements to determine
if any of those events and/or transactions requires adjustment to or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 4   Related Party  

Due from Related Parties   

Non-interest bearing amounts due on demand from
a related party was $666,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and consists primarily of amounts due from Sysorex
Consulting, Inc. As Sysorex Consulting, Inc. is a direct shareholder of and an investor in the Company, the amounts due from Sysorex
Consulting, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been classified in and as a reduction of stockholders' equity. 

Consulting Services Ordering Agreement
Amendment   

On March 25, 2016, the Company entered into
an Amendment No. 3 to its Consulting Services Ordering Agreement with Mr. A Salam Qureishi, who served as Chairman of the Board
and a Director of the Company (the  Consultant ) until September 30, 2016, effective March 16, 2016 (the  Amended
Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay the Consultant a fee of $20,000 per month for all consulting services
performed during the term of the agreement. In addition, the Amended Agreement provided for an extension of the original term
for an additional nine months from March 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 the Company recorded a charge of $90,000 and $210,000, and $90,000 and $270,000, respectively.

Convertible
Debenture and Preferred Stock Financing    

On
August 9, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hillair Capital Investments L.P. pursuant to which it issued
and sold (i) an 8% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Debenture in an aggregate principal amount of $5,700,000 due on
August 9, 2018 and (ii) 2,250 shares of newly created Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Preferred
Stock , together with the Debenture, the  Securities ), for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 (the  Transaction ).  

The debenture is due on August 9, 2018
and interest is payable quarterly on February 9, May 9, August 9 and November 9, commencing on May 9, 2017, as well as the dates
on which principal payments are made, as described in the agreement in cash, or upon notice to the holder and compliance with certain
equity conditions as set forth in the agreement in shares of the Company s common stock. The debenture is convertible any
time at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustments provided in the agreement. Subject
to certain equity conditions, the Company has the option to redeem the debenture before its maturity by payment in cash of 120%
or 110% (depending on the timing of the redemption) of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and other charges.
The Company is required to redeem 25% of the initial principal amount of the debenture plus accrued unpaid interest and other charges
in November 2017, February 2018, May 2018, and August 2018. 

The debenture is convertible into common
stock at any time by the shareholder at $1.50 per share. In addition under the terms of the agreement if, at any time following
the six month anniversary of the original issue date or, in the event the Company sells or grants any option to purchase or sells
or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at an
effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price then the conversion price is reduced to equal the lower price.
The conversion price will have a floor $0.47 per share. 

The Company evaluated the embedded
conversion feature within the debenture in accordance with FASB ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging.  The conversion
price was deemed to have a reset provision with down round protection and was recorded as a derivative liability. The Company
calculated the fair value of $51,000 for the embedded conversion feature using the Binomial Lattice Model which was recorded as
a discount to the debenture using the residual method. The debt discount is charged to interest expense ratably over the term
of the note and the derivative liability will be marked to market through earnings at the end of each reporting period. 

The
proceeds from the sale of the Securities will be used for the repayment of the outstanding balance on the Company s term
loan with Western Alliance Bank, as successor in interest to Bridge Bank National Association (the  Lender ) in an
amount equal to approximately $1.4 million, the repayment of accounts payable of at least $1 million, business development activities,
capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses.  

Note
10 - Common Stock   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 95,000 shares of common stock for services which were fully vested
upon the date of issuance. The Company recorded an expense of $47,000 for the fair value of those shares.

Hannah Granade issued in accordance with the terms of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated April 24, 2015 by and among
the Company, LightMiner and Chris Baskett. 283,575 shares owed under the Lightminer acquisition remain in escrow as of September
30, 2016. The Company had recorded the $3,781,000 value of the shares as part of the purchase price of the assets during the quarter
ended June 30, 2015. 

Note 11 - Convertible Series 1 Preferred
Stock  

On August 9, 2016, the Company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued and sold (i) an 8% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Debenture
in an aggregate principal amount of $5,700,000 and (See Note 9) (ii) 2,250 shares of newly created Series 1 Convertible Preferred
Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000. 

The Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized
has a stated price of $1,000 per share, par value of $0.001 and the Company is authorized to issue 5,000,0000 shares. The Series
1 Convertible Preferred Stock is not cumulative, has no redemption features outside the control of the Company and has a liquidation
preference of $2,250,000 and is subject to certain typical anti-dilution provisions, such as stock dividend or stock splits. 

The Series 1 Convertible
Preferred Stock is convertible at any time by the shareholder at $1.50 per share. In addition under the terms of the
agreement if, at any time following the six month anniversary of the original issue date or, in the event the Company sells
or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues any shares of
common stock or common stock equivalents at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price, then the
conversion price is reduced to equal the lower price . The conversion price will have a floor $0.47 per share. The holders of
the Company s Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights. Because the conversion option associated with
the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock is clearly and closely related to the host instrument, the conversion option does
not require bifurcation and classification as a derivative liability. 

Note
12 - Stock Options    

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company granted options for the purchase of 102,500 shares of common stock to employees
of the Company. These options vest pro-rata over 48 months and have a life of ten years and an exercise price of $0.52 per share.
The Company valued the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the fair value of the award was $27,000.
The fair value of the common stock as of the grant date was determined to be $0.52 per share.  

During
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company granted options for the purchase of 1,131,894 shares of common stock to employees
of the Company. These options vest pro-rata over 48 months and have a life of ten years and an exercise price of $0.52 per share.
The Company valued the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the fair value of the award was $292,000.
The fair value of the common stock as of the grant date was determined to be $0.52 per share.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options for the purchase of 347,500 shares of common stock to employees
of the Company. These options vest pro-rata over 48 months and have a life of ten years and an exercise price of $0.47 per share.
The Company valued the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the fair value of the award was $81,000.
The fair value of the common stock as of the grant date was determined to be $0.47 per share.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the fair value of non-vested options totaled $2,639,000 which will be amortized to expense over the weighted
average remaining term of 1.45 years.  

The
fair value of each employee option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  Key
weighted-average assumptions used to apply this pricing model during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as
follows:  

The
expected stock price volatility for the Company s stock options was determined by the historical volatilities for industry
peers and used an average of those volatilities.  The Company attributes the value of stock-based compensation to operations
on the straight-line single option method.  Risk free interest rates were obtained from U.S. Treasury rates for the applicable
periods. The dividends assumptions was $0 as the Company historically has not declared any dividends and does not expect to.

Note 13   Fair Value  

The Company measures the fair value
of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC
820 ) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices available in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities trading in active markets. 

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than
quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quotable prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes
certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 

Financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, short term advances and deferred revenues are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair
value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company s other financial instruments include notes payable,
the carrying value of which approximates fair value, as the notes bear terms and conditions comparable to market for obligations
with similar terms and maturities, as well as warrant liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as
of September 30, 2016, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

Note
14 - Credit Risk and Concentrations    

Financial
instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents.
The Company performs certain credit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to
credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, establishes an allowance for uncollectible
accounts and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowances is limited.  

The
Company maintains cash deposits with financial institutions, which, from time to time, may exceed federally insured limits. Cash

Litigation    

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company,
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings
that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the
assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable
but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable
and material, would be disclosed.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Forward-Looking Statement Notice   

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Form 10-Q ). In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements, due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks described in the section entitled  Risk Factors. 
(Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms  Sysorex   we,   us, 
 our  and the  Company  refer collectively to Sysorex Global and its subsidiaries.)  

Overview of Our Business   

Sysorex provides data analytics
and indoor-location based solutions and services to commercial and government customers worldwide. We have developed a discovery
platform that blends data from traditional software and network systems with the growing universe of mobile and Internet-connected
things. In doing so, we have created a high velocity, secure and scalable platform that we believe allows customers to evaluate
their most complex business issues, helping them to compete successfully in their respective markets. Our analytics products provide
turnkey vertical solutions from ETL (extract, transform, load) to BI (business intelligence) to the final visualization of the
data. These solutions are available on-premise or in the Cloud. 

Our AirPatrol product provides
indoor-locationing based on cellular, wifi and Bluetooth signals in one sensor. As far as we know, there is no competitor that
can offer all three of these in one product and provide the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our AirPatrol platform. AirPatrol
can be used for security applications; retail analytics; asset tracking and a variety of other use-cases. We are expanding the
RF signal range that our sensors can detect so that we can detect any type of wireless device whether it be a drone or some RFID
or beacon embedded sensor. 

Our LightMiner product
line has two patents pending. LightMiner Studio is an in-memory, real-time, data analysis system designed to perform very large,
highly complex and extremely difficult calculations using off-the-shelf hardware and memory. It supports both traditional SQL-based
business intelligence and analytics applications as well as a host of integrated statistical, machine learning and artificial
intelligence algorithms allowing it to provide supercomputer-like performance at competitive prices. LightMiner is at the core
of our analytics platform and can be used for machine-to-machine (M2M) analytics; consumer analytics; predictive analytics; security;
and other data analysis projects. LightMiner fully integrates with our AirPatrol product and, in our opinion, the combined offering
is a valuable addition to the Internet of Things (IoT) market. 

Sysorex also provides supporting
products and services including enterprise computing and storage, virtualization, business continuity, data migration, custom
application development, networking and information technology business consulting services. These allow Sysorex to offer turnkey
solutions when requested by customers. 

Revenues from our storage
and computing segment are primarily driven by purchase orders that are received on a monthly basis. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 approximately 34% of such revenues are based on recurring contracts that range from one to five years for warranty
and maintenance support. For these contracts, the customer is invoiced one time and pays Sysorex upfront for the full term of
the warranty and maintenance contract. Revenue from these contracts is determinable ratably over the contract period with the
unearned revenue recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the contract period. 

Our Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS) contracts are typically performed for periods of one or more years. Sysorex SaaS products include its Shoom product line
for the media and entertainment vertical, cloud based analytics services and other related services. 

Our mobile, IoT and data
analytics products segment includes our AirPatrol and LightMiner product lines. Sales for these products are expected to grow
as we expand our offering beyond the government vertical to commercial verticals including Retail, Banking and Healthcare. 

Recent Events  

Convertible Debenture and Preferred Stock
Financing   

On August 9, 2016, the
Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Hillair Capital Investments L.P.
(the  Investor ) pursuant to which it issued and sold (i) an 8% Original Issue Discount Senior Convertible Debenture
(the  Debenture ) in an aggregate principal amount of $5,700,000 (the  Principal Amount ) due on August
9, 2018 and (ii) 2,250 shares of newly created Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Preferred
Stock , together with the Debenture, the  Securities ), for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 (the  Transaction ). 

The proceeds from the sale
of the Securities will be used for the repayment of the outstanding balance on the Company s term loan with Western Alliance
Bank , as successor in interest to Bridge Bank National Association (the  Lender ) in an amount equal to approximately
$1.4 million, the repayment of accounts payable of at least $1 million, business development activities, capital expenditures,
working capital and general and administrative expenses. 

Debenture   

Interest and Conversion.
 Interest on the Debenture accrues at a rate of 8.0% per annum and is payable quarterly on February 9, May 9, August 9 and
November 9, commencing on May 9, 2017, as well as the dates on which principal payments are made, as described in the Debenture
in cash, or upon notice to the holder and compliance with certain equity conditions as set forth in the Debenture in shares of
the Company s common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be paid for any interest payment equals to the quotient
of (x) the applicable dollar amount to be paid divided by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below). Subject to certain limitations
including the beneficial ownership limitation and the maximum issuable shares limitation equal to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding
common stock of the Company, which may be removed upon receipt of shareholder approval, the Debenture is convertible at any time
at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustments provided in the Debenture (the  Conversion
Price ). 

Redemption.  Subject
to certain equity conditions, the Company has the option to redeem the Debenture before its maturity by payment in cash of 120%
or 110% (depending on the timing of the redemption) of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and other charges.
The Company is required to redeem 25% of the initial principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest and other charges on November
9, 2017, February 9, 2018, May 9, 2018, and August 9, 2018 (each, a  Periodic Redemption ). In lieu of a cash Periodic
Redemption payment, the Company may, upon notice to the holder and compliance with certain equity conditions, elect to pay all
or part of a Periodic Redemption in shares of common stock based on a conversion price equal to the Conversion Price. 

Default Events .
Each of the following events shall constitute an event of default: failure to make a payment obligation, failure to observe certain
covenants of the Debenture or related agreements (subject to applicable cure periods), breach of representation or warranty, bankruptcy,
default under another significant contract or credit obligation, delisting of the common stock, a change in control, or failure
to deliver stock certificates in a timely manner. In the event of a default, the Investor shall have the right to accelerate all
amounts outstanding under the Debenture and demand a mandatory default payment in an amount (the  Mandatory Default Amount )
equal to the greater of (i) the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture, plus all accrued and unpaid interest, divided
by the Conversion Price on the date the Mandatory Default Amount is either (A) demanded (if demand or notice is required to create
an Event of Default) or otherwise due or (B) paid in full, whichever has a lower Conversion Price, multiplied by the VWAP (as
defined in the Debenture) on the date the Mandatory Default Amount is either (x) demanded or otherwise due or (y) paid in full,
whichever has a higher VWAP, or (ii) 125% of the outstanding principal amount plus 100% of accrued and unpaid interest, and (b)
all other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the Debenture. 

Security.  The Debenture
is secured with a subordinated lien by certain property of the Company in accordance with the terms of a Security Agreement, dated
August 9, 2016 by and among the Company, each of its subsidiaries and the Investor (the  Security Agreement ). Each
of the subsidiaries also entered into a guarantee in favor of the Investor (the  Subsidiary Guarantee ), pursuant
to which each subsidiary guaranteed the complete payment and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Debenture
and related agreements. 

The Preferred Stock   

The rights, preferences
and privileges of the Preferred Stock issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement are set forth in a Certificate of Designation
of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on
August 5, 2016, as revised by the Certificate of Correction filed with the State of Nevada on August 9, 2016, effective upon filing
(as amended, the  Certificate ). The stated value of each share of Preferred Stock is $1,000, subject to increase
pursuant to the Certificate (the  Stated Value ). The holder of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receiving
dividends equal to dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when such dividends are paid on shares of the common
stock. The Preferred Stock has no voting rights however, the Company shall not take certain actions without the consent of a majority
of the outstanding holders of the Preferred Stock, including, issuing additional securities senior to or on par with the Preferred
Stock, amending the Certificate in any manner adverse to the rights of the Preferred Stock, or increasing the number of authorized
shares of the Preferred Stock. 

Conversion .  Subject
to certain limitations including the beneficial ownership limitation and the maximum issuable shares limitation as specified in
the Certificate, the Preferred Stock is convertible by the holder at any time into a number of shares of common stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the Stated Value by the then applicable Conversion Price. 

Other Rights   .
 Upon liquidation, the holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to an amount equal to the Stated Value, plus any accrued
and unpaid dividends and any other fees then due under the Certificate before any distribution is made to the holders of the junior
securities, including common stock, and shall have certain rights to anti-dilution protection.

JOBS Act  

Pursuant to Section
107 of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those
standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards
and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

Our consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. In connection with
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events,
and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We
base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes
to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies,
assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance
with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from
our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Our significant
accounting policies are discussed in note 3 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following
accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they
require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing. Historically
changes in management estimates have not been material.  

Revenue Recognition   

We provide IT solutions
and services to customers with revenues currently derived primarily from the sale of third-party hardware and software products,
software, assurance, licenses and other consulting services, including maintenance services. The products and services we sell,
and the manner in which they are bundled, are technologically complex and the characterization of these products and services require
judgment in order to apply revenue recognition policies. For all of these revenue sources, we determine whether we are the principal
or agent in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic, 605-45 Principal Agent Considerations. 

We allocate the total arrangement
consideration to the deliverables based on an estimated selling price of our products and services and report revenues containing
multiple deliverable arrangements under ASC 605-25  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  ( ASC-605-25 ).
These multiple deliverable arrangements primarily consist of the following deliverables: third-party computer hardware, third-party
software, hardware and software maintenance (a.k.a. support), and third-party services. We determine the estimated selling price
using cost plus a reasonable margin for each deliverable, which was based on our established policies and procedures for providing
customers with quotes, as well as historical gross margins for our products and services. From time to time our personnel are
contracted to perform installation and services for the customer. In situations where we bundle all or a portion of the separate
elements, vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) is determined based on prices when sold separately. Our revenue recognition
policies vary based upon these revenue sources and the mischaracterization of these products and services could result in misapplication
of revenue recognition polices. 

We recognize revenue when
the following criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) shipment (software and hardware) or fulfillment
(maintenance) has occurred and applicable services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability
is reasonably assured. Generally, these criteria are met upon shipment to customers with respect to the sales of hardware and
software products. With respect to our maintenance and other service agreements, this criteria is met once the service has been
provided. Revenue from the sales of our services on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as
direct labor hours are expended. We recognize revenue for sales of all services on a fixed fee ratably over the term of the arrangement
as such services are provided. The Company evaluates whether the revenues it receives from the sale of hardware and software products,
licenses, and services, including maintenance and professional consulting services should be recognized on a gross or net basis
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We maintain primary responsibility for the materials and procedures utilized to service
our customers, even in connection with the sale of third party-products and maintenance services, as we are responsible for the
fulfillment and acceptability of the products and services purchased by our customers. In addition, the nature of the products
sold to our customers are such that they need configuration in order to be utilized properly for the purposes intended by the
customer and therefore we assume certain responsibility for product staging, configuration, installation, modification, and integration
with other client systems, or retain general inventory risk upon customer return or rejection. Our customers rely on us to develop
the appropriate solutions and specifications applicable to their specific systems and then integrate any such required products
or services into their systems. As described above, we are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and warranty services provided
in connection with all of our existing customer relationships, whether such services are ultimately provided directly by the Company
and its employees or by the applicable third party service provider. As of the date of this filing, after an evaluation of all
of our existing customer relationships, we have concluded that we are the primary obligor to all of our existing customers and
therefore recognize all revenues on a gross basis. 

Long-lived Assets   

We account for our long-lived
assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets  ( ASC 360 ), which requires that long-lived assets be evaluated whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Some of the events or
changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to: 

significant
    under-performance relative to expected and/or historical results (negative comparable sales growth or operating cash flows
    for two consecutive years);   

significant
    negative industry or economic trends;   

knowledge
    of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or   

our
    expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not
    meet the criteria to be classified as  held for sale.    

Long-lived assets are grouped
for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of
the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of our long-lived
assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and
arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the net carrying value of a group of long-lived assets exceeds
the sum of related undiscounted estimated future cash flows, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the
excess, if any, of net carrying value over fair value. 

When assessing the recoverability
of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding
estimated future cash flows and other factors. Some of these assumptions involve a high degree of judgment and also bear a significant
impact on the assessment conclusions. Included among these assumptions are estimating undiscounted future cash flows, including
the projection of comparable sales, operating expenses, capital requirements for maintaining property and equipment and residual
value of asset groups. We formulate estimates from historical experience and assumptions of future performance, based on business
plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions. In the event that our estimates or related
assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Based on our evaluation we did not record
a charge for impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We evaluate the remaining
useful lives of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision
to the remaining period of amortization is warranted. Such events or circumstances may include (but are not limited to): the effects
of obsolescence, demand, competition, and/or other economic factors including the stability of the industry in which we operate,
known technological advances, legislative actions, or changes in the regulatory environment. If the estimated remaining useful
lives change, the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets would be amortized prospectively
over that revised remaining useful life. We have determined that there were no events or circumstances during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, which would indicate a revision to the remaining amortization period related to any of our long-lived
assets. Accordingly, we believe that the current estimated useful lives of long-lived assets reflect the period over which they
are expected to contribute to future cash flows and are therefore deemed appropriate. 

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets   

We have recorded goodwill
and other indefinite-lived assets in connection with our acquisitions of Lilien, Shoom, AirPatrol and LightMiner. Goodwill, which
represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company,
is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination.
Our goodwill balance and other assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for potential impairment during the fourth quarter of
each year and in certain other circumstances. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business
to the recorded value, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of the business, we utilize both the  income approach ,
which is based on estimates of future net cash flows and the  market approach , which observes transactional evidence
involving similar businesses. There was no goodwill impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Deferred Income Taxes   

In accordance with ASC
740  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its
income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for any valuation allowance, management
will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Ultimately,
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which
temporary differences become deductible and/or tax credits and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In performing its analyses,
management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance, previous earnings patterns,
future earnings forecasts, tax planning strategies, economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating
loss carry-forwards within a reasonable timeframe. To this end, management considered (i) that we have had historical losses in
the prior years and cannot anticipate generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of our
deferred tax asset; (ii) tax planning strategies; and (iii) the adequacy of future income as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, based upon certain economic conditions and historical losses through September 30, 2016. After consideration
of these factors, management deemed it appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance.  

A liability for  unrecognized
tax benefits  is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company s tax filings that do not meet these recognition
and measurement standards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was
required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No
interest or penalties were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

We maintain our reserves
for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances.
We assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly, but no less than annually.
Management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based
on the age of the receivable balance, the customer s credit quality rating, an evaluation of historical credit losses, current
economic conditions, and other relevant factors. 

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, allowance for credit losses included a general allowance of $697,000 and $285,000, respectively, due to
the aging of the items greater than 120 days outstanding and other potential non-collections. 

Business Combinations   

We account for business
combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business
are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is
recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization
of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price
allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our condensed consolidated
financial results will be adjusted. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs
are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at
which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business
combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment
accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. 

Upon acquisition, the accounts
and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements from the acquisition date.  

Stock-Based Compensation   

We account for equity instruments
issued to non-employees in accordance with accounting guidance, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their
fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date the services are performed. 

We account for equity instruments
issued to employees in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that awards are recorded at their fair value on the date
of grant and are amortized over the vesting period of the award. We recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period
of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the equity instrument issued. 

The Black-Scholes option
valuation model is used to estimate the fair value of the options or the equivalent security granted. The model includes subjective
input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options or warrants. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time equal
to the weighted average life of the options granted. 

The principal assumptions
used in applying the Black-Scholes model along with the results from the model were as follows: 

The Company incurred stock-based compensation
charges, net of estimated forfeitures of $344,000 and $391,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1,055,000
and $885,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    

Operating

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following table sets
forth selected unaudited consolidated financial data as a percentage of our revenue and the percentage of period-over-period change: 

Net Revenues  

Net revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $11.2 million compared to $14.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease
in revenues of $3.7 million are primarily attributable to the Storage and Computing segment. Although we expect storage and computing
to grow nominally on an annual basis, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we did see a contraction. This contraction is
an industry trend as companies are shifting to the cloud and tech refreshes are occurring less frequently. This is impacting revenues
as well as narrowing margins. Our strategy to counter this trend is to expand the segment into the government vertical and offset
the contraction we are experiencing on the commercial side. This is why Sysorex has pursued the large government IDIQ contracts
(e.g, SEWP, CIO-CS, etc.) and are focusing our sales effort to grow revenue on these contracts. For the three months ended September
30, 2016, Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products revenue was $542,000 compared to $487,000 for the prior year period. Storage and
Computing revenue was $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $10.3 million for the prior year period.
SaaS Revenues was $826,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $871,000 during the prior year period. Professional
Services Revenue was $2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $3.2 million during the prior year period. 

Cost of Net Revenues  

Cost of net revenues for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $8.1 million compared to $10.5 million for the prior year period. The decrease in
cost of revenues of $2.4 million is primarily attributable to the decrease in the related sales of the Storage and Computing segment.
Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products cost of net revenues was $249,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $183,000 for the prior period. Storage and Computing cost of net revenues was $6.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, and $8.4 million for the prior year period. SaaS Revenues cost of net revenues was $239,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and $192,000 during the prior year period. Professional Services cost of net revenues was $1.0 million
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.7 million during the prior year period. 

The gross profit margin
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 28% compared to 30% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower gross margin for the Storage and Computing segment during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016. Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
54% and 62%, respectively. Gross margins for the Storage and Computing segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were 16% and 18%, respectively. Gross margins for SaaS Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
71% and 78%, respectively. Gross margins for Professional Services revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were 49% and 47%, respectively. 

Operating Expenses  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $7.2 million compared to $7.5 million for the prior year period. This
decrease in operating expenses of $300,000 is primarily attributable to lower sales costs. 

Loss from Operations  

Loss
from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.1 million compared to $3.1 for the prior year period. This
increase in loss of $1.0 million was primarily attributable to lower revenue during the quarter and therefore lower gross profit
to offset the operating expenses. 

Other Income/Expense  

Net other income/expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were ($578,000) and ($49,000), respectively. This increase of $529,000
was primarily attributable to $196,000 of amortization of the debt discount of the debenture and increased interest on the bank
facilities. 

Provision for Income Taxes  

There was no provision
for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Deferred tax assets resulting from such losses are fully
reserved as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 since, at present, we have no history of taxable income and it is more likely than
not that such assets will not be realized.  

Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling
Interest  

Net loss attributable to
non-controlling interest for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4,000. 

Net Loss Attributable To Common Stockholders  

Net loss attributable to
common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.7 million compared to $3.2 for the prior year period.
This increase in net loss of $1.5 million was attributable to the changes discussed above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following table sets
forth selected unaudited consolidated financial data as a percentage of our revenue and the percentage of period-over-period change: 

Net Revenues  

Net revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $38.7 million compared to $46.7 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease
in revenues of $8.0 million are primarily attributable to the Storage and Computing segment. Although we expect storage and computing
to grow nominally on an annual basis, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we did see a contraction. This contraction is
an industry trend as companies are shifting to the cloud and tech refreshes are occurring less frequently. This is impacting revenues
as well as narrowing margins. Our strategy to counter this trend is to expand the segment into the government vertical and offset
the contraction we are experiencing on the commercial side. This is why Sysorex has pursued the large government IDIQ contracts
(e.g, SEWP, CIO-CS, etc.) and are focusing our sales effort to grow revenue on these contracts. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products revenue was $1.2 million compared to $862,000 for the prior year period. Storage
and Computing revenue was $26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $34.0 million for the prior year period.
SaaS Revenues was approximately $2.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $2.8 million during the prior
year period. Professional Services Revenue was $8.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $9.0 million during
the prior year period. 

Cost of Net Revenues  

Cost of net revenues for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $28.2 million compared to $32.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease in
cost of revenues of $4.4 million is primarily attributable to the decrease in the related sales of the Storage and Computing segment
in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products cost of net revenues was $416,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $377,000 for the prior period. Storage and Computing cost of net revenues was $21.9 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $27.3 million for the prior year period. SaaS Revenues cost of net revenues
was $649,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $620,000 during the prior year period. Professional Services
cost of net revenues was $5.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $4.3 million during the prior year period. 

The gross profit margin
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 27% compared to 30% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower gross margin for the Storage and Computing segment during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016. Mobile, IoT   Big Data Products gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
66% and 56%, respectively. Gross margins for the Storage and Computing segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were 18% and 20%, respectively. Gross margins for SaaS Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
73% and 78%, respectively. Gross margins for Professional Services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were 38% and 52%, respectively.  

Operating Expenses  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $22.8 million compared to $21.8 million for the prior year period.
This increase of $1.0 million was primarily attributable to costs associated with the development of new products as well as increased
amortization and depreciation. 

Loss from Operations  

Loss
from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.3 million compared to $7.6 for the prior year period. This
increase in loss of $4.7 million was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross margin of $3.6 million which is primarily
attributable to the Storage and Computing segment and an increase in amortization of intangibles, depreciation, and costs associated
with the development of new products. 

Other Income/Expense  

Net other income/expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were ($929,000) and ($144,000), respectively. This increase of $785,000
was primarily attributable to $196,000 of amortization of the debt discount of the debenture and increased interest on the bank
facilities. 

Provision for Income Taxes  

There was no provision
for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Deferred tax assets resulting from such losses are fully
reserved as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 since, at present, we have no history of taxable income and it is more likely than
not that such assets will not be realized. 

Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling
Interest  

Net loss attributable to
non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12,000 compared to a net loss of $7,000 for the prior
year period. This increase of $5,000 was attributable to an increase in losses for Sysorex Arabia and was not material. 

Net Loss Attributable To Common Stockholders  

Net loss attributable to
common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $13.2 million compared to $7.8 million for the prior year
period. This increase in net loss of $5.4 million was attributable to the changes discussed above. 

Non-GAAP Financial information   

EBITDA   

EBITDA is defined as net
income (loss) before interest, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is
used by our management as the matrix in which it manages the business. It is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income
or expense items, non-recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation.  

Adjusted EBITDA for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $2.4 million compared to a loss of $1.5 million for the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $7.0 million compared to a loss of $2.8 million for
the prior year period. 

The following table presents
a reconciliation of net income/loss attributable to stockholders of Sysorex Global, which is our GAAP operating performance measure,
to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

We rely on Adjusted EBITDA,
which is a non-GAAP financial measure for the following: 

To
    review and assess the operating performance of our Company;     

To
    compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our
    industry;   

As
    a basis for allocating resources to various projects;   

As
    a measure to evaluate potential economic outcomes of acquisitions, operational alternatives and strategic decisions; and   

To
    evaluate internally the performance of our personnel.   

We have presented Adjusted
EBITDA above because we believe it conveys useful information to investors regarding our operating results. We believe it provides
an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net
income (loss). By including this information we can provide investors with a more complete understanding of our business. Specifically,
we present Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental disclosure because of the following: 

We
    believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect
    of interest, income taxes, and other non-operating expenses as well as depreciation and amortization which are non-cash expenses;   

We
    believe that it is useful to provide investors with a standard operating metric used by management to evaluate our operating
    performance; and   

We
    believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to compare our results to other companies.   

Even though we believe
Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, it does have limitations as an analytical tool. Thus, we strongly urge investors not
to consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) and the other consolidated statement of operations
data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that: 

Adjusted
    EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;   

Adjusted
    EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;   

Adjusted
    EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
    payments, on our debt;   

Although
    depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced
    in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;   

Adjusted
    EBITDA does not reflect income or other taxes or the cash requirements to make any tax payments; and   

Other
    companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby potentially limiting its usefulness
    as a comparative measure.   

Because of these limitations,
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business
or as a measure of performance in compliance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results
and providing Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. 

Proforma Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share   

Proforma non-GAAP
net income (loss) per share is used by our Company s management as an evaluation tool as it manages the business and is
defined as net income (loss) per basic and diluted share adjusted for non-cash items including stock based compensation, amortization
of intangibles and one time charges including acquisition costs, the costs associated with the public offering, severance costs,
changes in the fair value of shares to be issued and changes in the fair value of a derivative liability. 

Proforma non-GAAP net
loss per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was ($0.13) compared to ($0.09) for the
prior year period. Proforma non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was ($0.35) compared to ($0.18) for the prior year period. These decreases were attributable to the changes discussed in our results
of operations. 

The following table presents
a reconciliation of net loss per basic and diluted share, which is our GAAP operating performance measure, to proforma non-GAAP
net loss per share for the periods reflected: 

We rely on proforma non-GAAP net loss per share,
which is a non-GAAP financial measure: 

To
    review and assess the operating performance of our Company;   

To
    compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our
    industry;   

As
    a measure to evaluate potential economic outcomes of acquisitions, operational alternatives and strategic decisions; and   

To
    evaluate internally the performance of our personnel.   

We have presented proforma
non-GAAP net loss per share above because we believe it conveys useful information to investors regarding our operating results.
We believe it provides an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and
the reconciliation to net income (loss), and that by including this information we can provide investors with a more complete
understanding of our business. Specifically, we present proforma non-GAAP net loss per share as supplemental disclosure because: 

We
    believe proforma non-GAAP net loss per share is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of our business
    without the effect of non-cash items including stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles and one time charges
    including acquisition costs, costs associated with the public offering, severance costs and changes in the fair value of shares
    to be issued.   

We
    believe that it is useful to provide investors with a standard operating metric used by management to evaluate our operating
    performance; and   

We
    believe that the use of proforma non-GAAP net loss per share is helpful to compare our results to other companies.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources as of
September 30, 2016 Compared With September 30, 2015   

The Company s net
cash flows used in operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and certain
balances as of the end of those periods are as follows (in thousands): 

Operating Activities:  

Net cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Net cash
used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The non-cash income and
expenses of $5,727,000 consisted primarily of (in thousands): 

The net use of cash due
to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $6,338,000 and consisted primarily of the following (in thousands): 

$  4,016       
     Decrease in accounts receivable and other receivables  
 
        1,248       
     Decrease in prepaid licenses and maintenance contracts  
 
        850       
     Increase in accounts payable  
 
        1,915       
     Increase in deferred revenue  
 
        (1,395  )    
     Decrease in accrued liabilities and other liabilities  
 
        (296  )    
     Decrease in inventory and other assets  
 
     $  6,338       
     Net use of cash in the changes in operating
    assets and liabilities  

Investing Activities:  

Net cash used in investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.6 million compared to net cash used in investing activities
of $891,000 for the prior year period. The net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was comprised of $461,000 for the purchase of property and equipment and $1.2 million investment in capitalized software. 

Financing Activities:  

Net cash used in financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $832,000. Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $6.9 million. The net cash used in financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was primarily comprised of $4.2 million of repayments to the Credit Facility, $1.6 million of repayments
to a term loan offset by $5 million received from the Debenture. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources - General:

Our current capital resources
and operating results as of September 30, 2016, as described in the preceding paragraphs, consist of: 

1)  
      An
    overall working capital deficit of $10.3 million;   

3)  
      The
    Credit Facility for up to $10 million which we borrow against based on eligible assets with a maturity date of April 29, 2017
    of which $4.4 million is utilized; and   

4)  
      Net
    cash used in operating activities year-to-date of $1.1 million.   

We believe our total working
capital deficit of $10.3 million does not represent a severe impediment to our operations and growth when its principal components
are separately identified and analyzed and the growth of our business is taken into account. The breakdown of our overall working
capital deficit is as follows (in thousands): 

Accounts payable exceeds
the related accounts receivable by $2.4 million. We do not believe there are material collectability issues with respect to our
accounts receivable. Deferred revenue exceeds the related prepaid contracts by $4.9 million and other liabilities exceed other
assets by $216,000. 

Net cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.1 million consists of net loss of $13.2 million less non-cash
expenses of $5.7 million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million. We expect net cash
from operations to increase during 2016 as: 

1 )  
      Sysorex
    was awarded two large multiple-award government IDIQ Contracts in 2015 and one in 1 st  Quarter of 2016 (NASA SEWP,
    NIH CIO-CS and PMSS-3) that enable Sysorex to capture task orders issued by any government agency under these contract vehicles.
    The Company has captured task orders under the NASA SEWP contract and believes that it will be successful in securing additional
    task orders under all of these contracts, however there are no assurances that additional task orders under the contracts
    will ultimately be awarded to the Company. If such task orders are secured, then these contracts will provide the opportunity
    to increase our revenue and cash flows.   

2 )  
      Sysorex
    is generating revenue from new versions of its AirPatrol product line that will contribute to operating cash flow and is expected
    to generate 60-70% gross margins.   

3 )  
      The
    Company launched its LightMiner product in the first half of 2016 which is expected to have 60-70% gross margins and
    will start contributing to cash-flow this year.   

4 )  
      We
    have a purchase order for a follow-on project to the Daruna contract for $4 million which we expect to collect before the
    end of this year.    

In addition, we anticipate
that our Daruna project will start in early 2017, which will result in $500,000 a month in revenue for 15 years with a total value
of $90 million. The Company s capital resources as of September 30, 2016, increased bank facility,
net proceeds from the September 25, 2015 offering and August 9, 2016 convertible debenture and preferred stock offering, higher
margin business line expansion and recent contract awards, including prepayments anticipated to be received are expected to be
sufficient to fund planned operations during the next twelve months from the filing of this quarterly report. While the Company
also has an effective registration statement on Form S-3 which will allow it to raise additional capital from the sale of its
securities, subject to certain limitations for registrants with a market capitalization of less than $75 million, if additional
financing is needed we anticipate such financing will come from an increase in our bank facility or from another lender rather
than through a sale of equity, however, our decision will be based on our capital requirements and the terms of the various types
of financing that will be available to us when we need it. The information in this Form 10-Q concerning the Company s Form
S-3 registration statement does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. If these sources do not provide the capital
necessary to fund the Company s operations during the next twelve months, the Company may need to reduce costs and curtail
certain aspects of its expansion activities or consider other means of obtaining additional financing, although there is no guarantee
that any such additional financing would be available to the Company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance
sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving
non-exchange traded contracts. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

For a discussion of recently
issued accounting standards, please see Note 3 to our financial statements, which is included in this report in Item 1. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.  

As a  smaller reporting
company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure controls are
procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are
also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions
are properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit
the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
principles. 

In connection with the
preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, management, with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation,
our Principal Executive and Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control   

A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

 PRESS RELEASE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 14, 2016

Exhibit 99.1  

News
Release   

November 14, 2016      

Sysorex
Announces intent to Purchase    

Certain
Assets of Integrio Technologies, LLC    

Accretive
Acquisition Expected to Expand Sysorex  Customer Base  

PALO
ALTO, Calif.    Sysorex (NASDAQ: SYRX), a developer of high performance analytics software and solutions, today announced
it has signed a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets of Integrio Technologies Inc. (Integrio). The total
purchase price for the assets will consist of $1.8 million in cash, 530,000 shares of Sysorex common stock, the assumption by
Sysorex of approximately $3 million in net liabilities and up to $1.2 million in earn-out payments to be paid over three years.
The completion of the asset purchase is subject to customary closing conditions.  

Integrio,
an SBA-designated small business headquartered in Herndon, VA, is an IT integration and engineering company with approximately
40 employees and a 20 plus year track record of providing cutting-edge solutions for network performance, secure wireless infrastructure,
software application lifecycle support, and physical cyber security, supporting the missions of federal, state and local government
agencies.  

We
believe that the purchase of Integrio s federal government contracts including FBI ITAP; Bureau of Prisons; U.S. Army ADMC2;
Department of Justice ITSS; and others will enhance Sysorex s Storage and Computing and Professional Services business segment
offerings for key government customers,  explained Sysorex CEO, Nadir Ali.  We believe it also provides additional
opportunities for Sysorex to sell its AirPatrol and LightMiner products to Integrio s customer base.   

We
are very pleased to welcome the Integrio Team to Sysorex and expect it will become a significant addition to our Professional
Services and Government VAR business segments,  continued Mr. Ali.  We expect that the addition of Integrio s
revenue, contracts and customers will enable Sysorex to significantly expand our presence in the government sector. As represented
by Integrio, it has generated more than $40 million per year in revenue over the past two years. As I said in the past, with the
overall slowdown in the commercial VAR business segment, we have begun shifting our focus to bid more aggressively on government
contracts like SEWP/CIO-CS and this acquisition allows us to balance our mix of public and private sector customers with a broader
capability in an area of our business that continues to show measured growth.

many of which are outside of the control of Sysorex and its subsidiaries, which could cause actual results to materially differ
from such statements. Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, the fluctuation of global
economic conditions, the performance of management and employees, the company s ability to obtain financing, competition,
general economic conditions and other factors that are detailed in the company s periodic and current reports available
for review at www.sec.gov. Furthermore, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment where new and unanticipated
risks may arise. Accordingly, investors should not place any reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results. We disclaim any intention to, and undertake no obligation to, update or revise forward-looking statements.
