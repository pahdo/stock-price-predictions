Note 1- Organization
and Description of Business   

Asia Training Institute, Inc., a Nevada
corporation, ( ATI,   Company,   Registrant,   we,   us,  or  our )
was incorporated on May 14, 2014 under the name  WeWearables, Inc.   The Company issued 17,000,000 shares
of its common stock to its founder, Thomas Chen, as consideration for the purchase of a business plan. 

On February 12, 2016 Mr. Chen sold all
17,000,000 shares of common stock to  Chien Heng  George  Chiang.  That
same date, two other stockholders sold all their shares, totaling 2,000,000, to Mr. Chiang, making him the principle stockholder
of the Company.  

On
February 12, 2016, Mr. Chiang became the sole director, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and the
Company s name was subsequently changed to Asia Training Institute, Inc.  

The
Company s current business strategy is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target operating company
or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  The Company s principal business
objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination
with an operating business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target
companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.   However,
the Company currently expects to focus on finding an operating business with significant operations in Asia .  

Note 2 -
SUMMARY OF Significant Accounting Policies   

(a) Basis of Accounting 

The Company s financial statements
are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company has elected March 31 as its
fiscal year end. 

The accompanying unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with
the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s most recent Annual Financial Statements,
found in Form 10-K filed June 24, 2016. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.  

(b) Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the balance sheet and
statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time
of issuance to be cash equivalents. 

(c) Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company follows ASC 718-10,  Stock
Compensation , which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods
or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  ASC
718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions).  Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent
modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.  The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and
has not granted any stock options. 

(d) Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

Preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 260. 

(e) Loss per Share 

The basic loss per share is calculated
by dividing the Company s net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares during
the year. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common stockholders
by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of
shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted
loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. 

(f) Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and
enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency
of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1   Inputs to the valuation
methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2   Inputs to the valuation
methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3   Inputs to the valuation
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

The Company s adoption of fair
value measurements and disclosures did not have a material impact on the financial statements and financial statement disclosures 

(g) Income Taxes 

Income taxes are provided in accordance
with ASC 740,  Income Taxes .  A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences
between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from
the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on the date of enactment. 

No provision was made for Federal or
State income taxes. 

(h) Advertising 

Advertising will be expensed in the
period in which it is incurred. There have been no advertising expenses for the reporting periods presented. 

(i) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company reviewed all recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC and they did not or are not
believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.

Note
3 - Going ConcerN   

  The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a negative working capital of $46,234 and an accumulated deficit
of $234,033 at September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not generated any revenue and had no committed
sources of capital or financing.  

While
the Company is attempting to merge with an operating business, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough
to support the Company s daily operations.  While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to merge
with an operating business and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve its objective or obtain adequate
financing.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
4  - Accrued Expenses   

Accrued expenses totaled $4,815 and
$11,434 at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively and consisted primarily of professional fees. 

Note
5 - Stockholders  Equity   

The Company is authorized to issue 150,000,000
shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Company issued 17,000,000 shares of its common stock to its
former president and chief executive officer as founder shares.  The Company issued 3,050,000 shares of its common stock
for services with a value attributed to them of $20,000. 

In January 2015, the Company completed
a public offering whereby it sold 362,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share for total gross proceeds of $36,200. 

On February 12, 2016 Mr. Chen sold all
17,000,000 of his shares of common stock to Mr.  Chiang.  That same date, two
other stockholders sold all of their shares, totaling 2,000,000, to Mr. Chiang, making him the principle stockholder of the Company.  

On
February 16, 2016, the Company s transfer agent canceled 1,000,000 shares of common stock previously outstanding at the request
of the previous stockholder.  At September 30, 2016 there were 19,412,000 shares of common   stock
issued and outstanding.  

Note
6  - Related Party Transactions   

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s sole director, officer and principal stockholder, Mr. Chiang,
paid Company expenses totaling $41,907 from personal funds. These expenses consisted primarily of professional fees and
filing fees. Mr. Chiang expects to be reimbursed by the Company for such payments, which reimbursement will be interest free
and due upon demand.

            MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

Forward
Looking Statements    

The information contained in this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q ) is intended to update the information contained in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 and presumes readers have access to, and will have read, the  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and other information contained in such Form 10-K.
The following discussion and analysis also should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  

The following discussion contains
certain statements that may be deemed  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements appear in a number of places in this Report, including, without limitation,  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risks, uncertainties and requirements that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We
strongly encourage investors to carefully read the factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March
31, 2016 in the section entitled  Risk Factors  for a description of certain risks that could, among other things,
cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements. We assume no responsibility to update the forward-looking
statements contained in this Form 10-Q. The following should also be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.   

Company Overview   

Asia Training Institute, Inc., a Nevada
corporation, ( ATI,   Company,   Registrant,   we,   us,  or  our )
was incorporated on May 14, 2014 under the name  WeWearables, Inc.  

The Company does not currently have
an operating business and has limited financial resources. The Company has not established a source of equity or debt financing.
Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain as a going concern. 

The Company has determined to change
its business focus from marketing and distribution for the next generation of wearable health and wellness devices as previously
described in the Company s filings with the SEC. The Company s current business strategy is to investigate and, if
such investigation warrants, acquire a target operating company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly
held corporation. The Company s principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time will be to achieve
long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company
will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus,
may acquire any type of business. However, the Company currently expects to focus on finding an operating business with significant
operations in Asia. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Refer to the notes to the financial
statements for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be
applicable to our operation, as well as those significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the current year. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management
judgments and estimates.  

We base our estimates on historical
experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates. 

Results of Operations   

Three Months Ending September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

General and Administrative
Expenses: 

General and administrative expenses
were $8,217 and $17,231 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 ( Q2 2016 ) and September 30, 2015 ( Q2
2015 ), respectively. The expenses for Q2 2016 consisted primarily of $8,070 for professional fees. For Q2 2015, the expenses
consisted primarily of $7,100 for professional fees and $10,131 for organization and related expenses. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses consisted primarily of a decrease in organization and related expenses. 

Six Months Ending September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015   

Development, General
and Administrative Expenses: 

Development, general and
administrative expenses were $34,800 and $53,296 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The
expenses for the six months ended September 30, 201 consisted primarily of $33,953 for professional fees. The expenses for the
six months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of $15,000 for website, $33,880 for accounting expenses and legal fees. 

Interest Expense: 

Interest expense was $0 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and $524 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The reduction in interest expense
was as a result of a related-party loan being repaid at the end of April 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The following is a summary of the Company s
cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

No
cash was used in investing activities during either the six months ended September 30, 2016 or the same p eriod of the prior
year. The Company does not currently have adequate financial resources to maintain its operations. The Company will need to seek
working capital through loans or sales of common stock. Until such time as we acquire an operating business, our principal stockholder
will likely be our principal source of funding. Our financial statements as of and for the six months ended September 30, 2016
include a  going concern  footnote contingent on us to be able to raise working capital to maintain our operations
as we seek an operating company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements,
as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, obligations under any guarantee contracts or contingent obligations. We
also have no other commitments, other than the costs of being a public company, which will increase our operating costs or cash
requirements in the future.

    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

              CONTROLS

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

Our management (our President and
Chief Financial Officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer)), evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act) as of September  30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer
concluded as of September 30, 2016, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level
and are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their
objectives.  However, it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting  

There has not been any change in the
