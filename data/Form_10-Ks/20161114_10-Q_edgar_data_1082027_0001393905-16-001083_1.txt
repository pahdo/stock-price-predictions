Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016     Unaudited     U.S. Dollars         1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN        Northstar Electronics Inc (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 11, 1998 in the state of Delaware.  These financial statements are consolidated with the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd. Any intercompany transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. The accounts of Northstar Technical Inc. ("NTI") and Northstar Network Ltd. ("NNL"), formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, have been written off in prior years as the operations of these subsidiaries have been discontinued.         The Company s business activities are conducted principally in Canada but these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with all figures translated into United States dollars for reporting purposes.       These unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information, are condensed and do not include all disclosures required for annual financial statements. The organization and business of the Company, accounting policies followed by the Company and other information are contained in the notes to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements filed as part of the Company s December 31, 2015 Form 10-K and amendments.       In the opinion of the Company s management, this consolidated interim financial information reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position at September 30, 2016 and the consolidated results of operations and the consolidated cash flows for the three and nine months then ended. The Company is in the process of regenerating its operations.       The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year. The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months to September 30, 2016 the Company incurred a net loss of $302,501 and at September 30, 2016 had a working capital deficiency (an excess of current liabilities over current assets) of $1,461,712 (December 31, 2015 deficiency of: $1,216,074. The Company is contingently liable for approximately $7,500,000 to repay assistance received under the Atlantic Innovation Fund.   (see also note 3)                8             Management has undertaken initiatives for the Company to continue as a going concern; for example: the Company is attempting to secure an equity financing in the short term. Management is unable to predict the results of its initiatives at this time.        Should management be unsuccessful in its initiative to finance its operations the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is not certain. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities which might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue its operations as a going concern.        2. SHARE CAPITAL         COMMON STOCK        During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the following shares of common stock were issued:           1,278,520 shares for cash of $12,500       1,400,000 shares for cash of $20,000       1,400,000 shares for conversion of 19,875 preferred shares valued at $35,000       31,400 shares for $4,364 interest expense       1,720,184 shares of common stock were issued for cash of $15,000       444,444 shares of common stock were issued for cash of $10,000       581,395 shares of common stock were issued for cash of $5,000        PREFERRED STOCK         Issued for cash:    The preferred shares bear interest at 10% per annum paid semiannually not in advance and are convertible to shares of common stock of the Company after two years from receipt of funds at a 20% discount to the then current market price of the Company s common stock. The preferred shares may be converted after six months and before two years under similar terms but with a 15% discount to market. At September 30, 2016 the Company held  $421,209 for 515,621 preferred shares.        3. CONTINGENCIES        The Company is contingently liable to repay $2,294,755 in assistance received by one of its subsidiaries under the Atlantic Innovation Fund, repayable annually at the rate of 5% of gross revenues from sales of products resulting from the subsidiaries research and development project. The Company became in default of this conditional loan, was unable to represent itself in Newfoundland court and ACOA was awarded a $7,500,000 judgment against the Company. The subsidiary generated negligible revenues from the program and the Company is in absolute disagreement with this outcome.                9              4. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                        10                Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.        The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial information for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 prepared by management and the audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as presented in the Company s Form 10K and amendments as filed.         Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements        Certain statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), press releases, presentations by the Company of its management and oral statements) may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should," and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance of the Company's products and services.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.        The Company s Services        We are now moving in a new direction whereby we intend to build our own systems in the civilian aviation sector. We believe that this affords improved control over the business outcomes compared to the contract manufacturing business.       The Company is working on plans to obtain rights to a single engine airplane with industrial applications. If successful, we intend to manufacture the airplanes and market them internationally and provide Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in close proximity to customers. The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd, is a 60% shareholder of Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd (NSEL). The constituent parts of NSEL have experience in working on certified commercial aircraft and government military contracts, and has access to an established aircraft parts manufacturing facility.        Results of Operations        Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015:       Gross revenues from all sources for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $0 compared to $0 in the comparative prior three month period.                 11             Gross revenues from all sources for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were $0 compared to $0 in the comparative prior nine month period. In prior years the Company earned modest consulting fees as the Company continued to reorganize its business.        The net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $(117,608) compared to a net loss of $(23,398) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in net loss was in part due to the fact the Company incurred additional office and administration expense as we worked to reorganize the Company after the write off of its previous ventures and for engineering expense and marketing expense incurred to advance its current project .        Comparison of Financial Position at September 30, 2016 with December 31, 2015        The Company s working capital deficiency increased at September 30, 2016 to $1,461,712 with current liabilities of $1,475,677 which are in excess of current assets of $13,965. At December 31, 2015 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1,216,074. See also contingent liabilities, note 3 to the financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        We have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in the footnotes to our annual financial statements at December 31, 2015. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.       Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us and have a material impact on our financial condition and results. Management believes its critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the presentation of our financial statements. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, accounting for stock based compensation and the evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets. We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as  special purpose entities .        Liquidity and Capital Resources        Cash outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(45,635) compared to an outflow of cash of $(20,903) in the comparative prior nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the current period, the Company received $42,500 ($0 in the comparative prior period) from equity funding leaving cash on hand at September 30, 2016 of $13,965 compared to cash on hand of $23,752 at December 31, 2015. Until the Company receives revenues from new contracts it will be dependent upon equity and loan financings to compensate for the outflow of cash anticipated from operations.             12             At this time, no commitment for funding has been made to the Company.       The Company s continued operations are dependent upon obtaining revenues from outside sources or raising additional funds through debt or equity financing.          Item 3. Controls and Procedures         (a)  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures        Based on the evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and are operating in an effective manner. The disclosure controls were effective at September 30, 2016.        (b)  Changes in internal controls        There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation.                                                                                                        13                PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1.

 CERTIFICATION

ex-31.1            Exhibit 31.1         CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. ss.1350, AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002        I, Wilson Russell, Chief Executive Officer of Northstar Electronics, Inc., certify that:       1.  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 of Northstar Electronics, Inc.;        2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;        3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;        4.
