Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  We have made statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including in  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ) that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking terms such as  may,   might,   will,   would,   could,   should,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   project,   possible,   potential,   intend,   seek  or  continue,  the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology or similar expressions. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, representatives of the media and others. These forward-looking statements represent only the Company's beliefs regarding future events (many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control) and are predictions only, based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In particular, you should consider the risks contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as Item 1A of this periodic report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this filing to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations. 
  Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2015 were audited.

  1. Organization and Business  
  Cowen Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 2009, is a diversified financial services firm and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively,  Cowen,   Cowen Group  or the  Company ), provides alternative investment management,   investment banking, research, sales and trading and prime brokerage   services through its   two   business segments: alternative investment and broker-dealer. The Company's alternative investment segment, includes   hedge funds, private equity structures, registered investment companies and listed vehicles  .  The Company's broker-dealer segment offers   research, sales and trading, prime brokerage and investment banking services to companies and primarily institutional investor clients  .  Our primary target sectors are   healthcare, technology, media and telecommunications, information and technology services, consumer, aerospace and defense, industrials,     and energy and transportation   sectors.  
   
  2. Acquisitions and Divestitures 
  Acquisitions 
  Low Country 
  On April 22, 2016, Cowen Aviation Finance Holdings Inc. ("Cowen Aviation Finance") entered into a transaction whereby Cowen Aviation Finance acquired Low Country III, LLC, which is comprised of a portfolio of four specialized aircraft currently on lease in exchange for an immaterial upfront payment and a minority equity interest in Cowen Aviation Finance.  As part of the transaction Cowen Aviation Finance also acquired the associated debt financing and lease contracts for each aircraft.  Separate from the transaction, Cowen Aviation Finance entered into services agreements with Tempus Applied Solutions, Inc., a related party through common directors, which, among other services, will provide marketing, maintenance, and lease administration services for Cowen Aviation Finance's current aircraft fleet.  This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") because, upon separation from the seller, the acquired assets do not meet the definition of a business.  
  CRT business 
  On May 6, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of the credit products, credit research, special situations and emerging markets units from CRT Capital Group LLC ( CRT ).  The acquisition was completed for a combination of cash of   $6.3 million   and contingent consideration payable annually based on future revenues exceeding specific targets.  In the aggregate, the purchase price, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not significant and the near term impact to the Company and its consolidated results of operations and cash flows is not expected to be significant. Following the acquisition, the businesses acquired from CRT are included in the broker-dealer segment. 
  In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company is required to pay to the sellers a portion of future revenue of the business exceeding specified targets over the period through June 2018. The Company estimated the contingent consideration using the income approach (discounted cash flow method) which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future cash flows and profits. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount recognized. On the acquisition date, the undiscounted amount ranged from   zero   to   $8.0 million  .   
  The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with US GAAP. As such, the results of operations of the businesses acquired  are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations since the date of the acquisition and the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill were recorded at their fair values within their respective line items on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial condition (see Note   8  ).   
  The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the valuation for certain acquired assets of CRT; therefore, the fair value measurements as of   September 30, 2016   and goodwill are preliminary and subject to adjustments.  
  The Company recognized approximately   $0.4 million   of acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, and valuation services.  These costs are included in professional, advisory and other fees in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The Company also assumed contractual obligations toward certain employees which will vest over a 12 month period.  These obligations are recorded as compensation expense on a straight line basis.  
  The results of operations of the businesses acquired from CRT for the period from May 6, 2016 through   September 30, 2016   are integrated with the broker-dealer business and are included within respective line items.  Included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are  
  
   10 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

revenues of   $9.7 million   and   $13.1 million  , respectively and net income of   $1.4 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively (excluding corporate allocated expenses) related to the businesses acquired from CRT.  
  Concept and Conifer 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company completed two acquisitions.  On September 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding interests in Concept Capital Markets, LLC ("Concept") offering prime brokerage services and outsourced trading. On October 1, 2015 the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding interests in Conifer Securities, LLC ("Conifer") representing the prime brokerage services division of Conifer Financial Services LLC.  Following the acquisitions, Concept was renamed Cowen Prime Services LLC ("Cowen Prime") and Conifer was renamed Cowen Prime Services Trading LLC ("Cowen Prime Trading").  Both were registered broker-dealers (members Financial Industry Regulatory Authority "FINRA" and Securities Industry Protection Corporation "SIPC").  Following the acquisitions, Conifer and Concept were integrated.  During the second quarter of 2016, Cowen Prime Trading's broker-dealer withdrawal request, filed with FINRA, became effective and the business was combined into Cowen Prime.  
  The acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with US GAAP. As such, the results of operations for Concept and Conifer are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations since the dates of the respective acquisitions and the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill were recorded at their fair values within their respective line items on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. 
  The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the valuation for certain acquired assets of Concept and Conifer; therefore, the fair value measurements and goodwill are preliminary and subject to measurement period adjustments.  The allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired will be finalized as necessary, up to one year after the acquisitions' respective closing dates, as the information becomes available.    Both of the acquisitions were not deemed material individually but were material in the aggregate.  
  Included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are revenues of   $8.6 million   and   $30.7 million   and net income of   $0.4 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively (excluding corporate allocated expenses) related to the Concept and Conifer combined results of operations.  
  The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents consolidated financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as if the acquisitions were completed as of the beginning of that period. This supplemental pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Company's results would have been had the acquisitions been completed on January 1, 2015, nor does it purport to be indicative of any future results.  

Divestitures 
  On September 23, 2016, the Company and the portfolio managers of     Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC     ("RASL")     completed the sale of their respective ownership interests in RASL, an investment advisor  , and RASL was deconsolidated as of that date.    RASL offered a range of customized hedge fund investment solutions with approximately     $2.5 billion     in client assets.    In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company was only required to transfer an immaterial target working capital balance on the closing date.    The net consideration received by the Company was approximately     $17.3 million  .    Along with the target working capital transferred at closing, the Company also     allocated a portion of goodwill associated with the alternative investment segment to the sale price     which is shown net in other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

As the Company will continue to offer its alternative investment platform to institutional and retail investors, the sale was not presented as discontinued operations. The overall impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows is not expected to be significant.  
   
  3. Significant Accounting Policies 
  a.      Basis of Presentation 
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") through Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles in the preparation of financial statements, and include the accounts of the Company, its operating and other subsidiaries, and entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or a general partner interest. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. Certain fund entities that are consolidated in these accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as further discussed below, are not subject to the consolidation provisions with respect to their own controlled investments pursuant to their specialized accounting.  
  The Company serves as the managing member/general partner and/or investment manager to affiliated fund entities which it sponsors and manages. Funds in which the Company has a controlling financial interest are consolidated with the Company pursuant to US GAAP as described below. Consequently, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of these funds on a gross basis. The ownership interests in these funds that are not owned by the Company are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The management fees and incentive income earned by the Company from these funds are eliminated in consolidation.  
  The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures included in the audited financial statements. 
           b. 
    Principles of consolidation 
     The Company consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise, including those funds in which the Company either directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. In addition, the Company consolidates all variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.    
  The Company adopted the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation accounting using the modified retrospective method with an effective adoption date of January 1, 2016. The modified retrospective method did not require the restatement of prior year periods. The adoption of the new accounting pronouncement also resulted in a reclassification of certain entities whic  h were previously considered voting interest entities and are considered variable interest entities  . 
  In accordance with these standards, the Company   presently consolidates     six     funds for which it acts as the general partner and investment manager.   As of September 30, 2016 the Company consolidated the following funds: Ramius Enterprise LP ( Enterprise LP ), Ramius Merger Fund LLC (the "Merger Fund"), Cowen Private Investments LP ("Cowen Private"), Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund ("Archview Feeder Fund"), Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Master Fund ("Archview Master Fund"), (as of May 1, 2016) Caerus Select Fund LP ("Caerus LP") and (as of July 11, 2016) Ramius Merger Arbitrage UCITS Fund ("UCITS Fund") (collectively the "Consolidated Funds"). 
  The Company determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting operating entity ("VOE") or a variable interest entity ("VIE") under US GAAP.    
  Voting Operating Entities     VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders at risk have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.    
  Under US GAAP, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a VOE is ownership of a majority voting interest. Accordingly, the Company consolidates all VOEs in which it owns a majority of the entity's voting shares or units.  
  In connection with the adoption, the Company reevaluated all of its investment products for consolidation. As of January 1, 2016, the Company deconsolidated Quadratic Fund LLC ("Quadratic LLC") as the Company did not hold a significant voting interest in the fund. The adoption of the new accounting pronouncement also resulted in a reclassification of certain entities for which the Company was presumed to have control and will now be VIEs.     
  Variable Interest Entities   VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. In accordance with US GAAP, an enterprise must consolidate all VIEs of which it is the primary beneficiary. Under the US GAAP consolidation  
  
   12 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

model for VIEs, an enterprise that (1) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE's economic performance, and (2) has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and thus is required to consolidate it.     
  The Company reconsiders whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing a periodic qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of the VIE that includes a review of, among other things, its capital structure, contractual agreements between the Company and the VIE, the economic interests that create or absorb variability, related party relationships and the design of the VIE.     As of     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   the total net assets of the consolidated VIEs were     $452.0 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively.    The VIEs act as investment managers and/or investment companies that may be managed by the Company or the Company may have equity interest in those investment companies.  The VIEs are financed through their operations and/or loan agreements with the Company.    
  As of   September 30, 2016     the Company holds variable interests in Ramius Enterprise Master Fund Ltd ( Enterprise Master ),   Ramius Merger Master Fund Ltd ("Merger Master") and Caerus Select Master Fund Ltd ("Caerus Master")  (collectively the  Unconsolidated Master Funds ) through the Consolidated Funds.  Investment companies, which account for their investments under the specialized industry accounting guidance for investment companies prescribed under US GAAP, are not subject to the consolidation provisions for their investments. Therefore, the Company has not consolidated the Unconsolidated Master Funds.    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company also sponsors various other entities that it has determined to be VIEs. These VIEs are primarily funds and real estate entities for which the Company serves as the general partner, managing member and/or investment manager with decision-making rights.    
  The Company does not consolidate   the Unconsolidated Master Funds or real estate   entities that are VIEs as it has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary in each instance. Fund investors are entitled to all of the economics of these VIEs with the exception of the management fee and incentive income, if any, earned by the Company. The Company's involvement with funds and real estate entities that are unconsolidated VIEs is limited to providing investment management services in exchange for management fees and incentive income. Although the Company may advance amounts and pay certain expenses on behalf of the funds and real estate entities that it considers to be VIEs, it does not provide, nor is it required to provide, any type of substantive financial support to these entities outside of regular investment management services   (see Note   5     for additional disclosures on VIEs).     
  Equity Method Investments     For operating entities over which the Company exercises significant influence but which do not meet the requirements for consolidation as outlined above, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The Company's investments in equity method investees are recorded in other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company's share of earnings or losses from equity method investees is included in net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. The difference between the carrying value of the equity method investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment charge when the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.    
  Other     If the Company does not consolidate an entity, apply the equity method of accounting or account for an investment under the cost method, the Company accounts for such entities (primarily, all securities of such entity which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term as trading securities) in accordance with US GAAP, at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in fair value reflected within net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  Retention of Specialized Accounting     The Consolidated Funds and certain other consolidated companies are investment companies and apply specialized industry accounting for investment companies. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for these funds pursuant to US GAAP. The Company reports its investments on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition at their estimated fair value, with unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in fair value reflected within net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other transactions.  Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect different accounting policies for investments depending on whether or not they are held through a consolidated investment company. In addition, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries  , Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen and Company"), ATM Execution LLC ("ATM Execution"), Cowen International Limited

("CIL"), Ramius UK Ltd. ("Ramius UK") and Cowen Prime   apply the specialized industry accounting for brokers and dealers in securities also prescribed under US GAAP. The Company also retains specialized accounting in consolidation.

     The preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the fair value of securities and other investments, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  
           d. 
    Valuation of investments and derivative contracts 
     US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The     three     levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:     
  Level 1         Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has    
         the ability to access at the measurement date;    
    
  Level 2           Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including     
         inputs in markets that are not considered to be active; and    
    
  Level 3         Fair value is determined based on pricing inputs that are unobservable and includes situations where there is little,     
         if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in this     
         category requires significant management judgment or estimation.    
  Inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may include price information, volatility statistics, specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics, and other factors. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes  observable  requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company considers observable data to be that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the Company's perceived risk of that instrument.    
  The Company and its operating subsidiaries act as the manager for the Consolidated Funds. Both the Company and the Consolidated Funds hold certain investments which are valued by the Company, acting as the investment manager. The fair value of these investments is generally estimated based on proprietary models developed by the Company, which include discounted cash flow analysis, public market comparables, and other techniques and may be based, at least in part, on independently sourced market information. The material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows, the appropriateness of discount rates used, and, in some cases, the ability to execute, timing of, and estimated proceeds from expected financings. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the selection of an appropriate valuation methodology as well as the assumptions used in these models, and the timing and actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values derived based on the use of those estimates. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of the Company's investments and the investments held by the Consolidated Funds in the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Company's investments are relatively illiquid or thinly traded and may not be immediately liquidated on demand if needed. Fair values assigned to these investments may differ significantly from the fair values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and such differences could be material  . 
  The Company primarily uses the  market approach  to value its financial instruments measured at fair value. In determining an instrument's level within the hierarchy, the Company categorizes the Company's financial instruments into     three     categories: securities, derivative contracts and other investments. To the extent applicable, each of these categories can further be divided between those held long or sold short.     
    The Company has the option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The election is made on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of  
  
   14 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.  The Company has elected the fair value option for certain of its investments held by its operating companies.  This option has been elected because the Company believes that it is consistent with the manner in which the business is managed as well as the way that financial instruments in other parts of the business are recorded.    
  Securities     Securities with values based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  These securities include active listed equities, certain U.S. government and sovereign obligations, ETF's, mutual funds and certain money market securities. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.    
  Certain positions for which trading activity may not be readily visible, consisting primarily of convertible debt, corporate debt and loans and restricted equities, are stated at fair value and classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair values assigned by management are determined in good faith and are based on available information considering, trading activity, broker quotes, quotations provided by published pricing services, counterparties and other market participants, and pricing models using quoted inputs, and do not necessarily represent the amounts which might ultimately be realized. As level 2 investments include positions that are not always traded in active markets and/or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability.    
  Derivative contracts     Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or privately negotiated over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures contracts and exchange-traded option contracts, are typically classified within level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether or not they are deemed to be actively traded. OTC derivatives, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, have inputs which can generally be corroborated by market data and are therefore classified within level 2.      OTC derivatives, such as swaps and options where market data is not readily available or observable are classified as level 3.    
  Other investments     Other investments consist primarily of portfolio funds, real estate investments and equity method investments, which are valued as follows  : 
           i. 
    Portfolio funds   Portfolio funds ( Portfolio Funds ) include interests in funds and investment companies which may be managed by the Company or its affiliates. The Company follows US GAAP regarding fair value measurements and disclosures relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value ( NAV ) per share (or its equivalent). The guidance permits, as a practical expedient, an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies as defined by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment.     In accordance with US GAAP, investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.    
              ii. 
    Real estate investments   Real estate debt and equity investments are valued at fair value. The fair value of real estate investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. Real estate investments without a public market are valued based on assumptions and valuation techniques used by the Company. Such valuation techniques may include discounted cash flow analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates or earnings multiples applied to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, the Company considers several valuation techniques when measuring the fair value of a real estate investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate. Real estate investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Company for significant changes at the property level or a significant change in the overall market which would impact the value of the real estate investment resulting in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.    
     Real estate and capital markets are cyclical in nature. Property and investment values are affected by, among other things, the availability of capital, occupancy rates, rental rates and interest and inflation rates. In addition, the Company invests in real estate and real estate related investments for which no liquid market exists. The market prices for such investments may be volatile and may not be readily ascertainable. Amounts ultimately realized by the Company from investments sold may differ from the fair values presented, and the differences could be material.    
  The Company's real estate investments are typically categorized as level 3 investments within the fair value hierarchy as management uses significant unobservable inputs in determining their estimated fair value.

           e. 
    Fixed Assets 
     Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their useful life or lease term. When the Company commits to a plan to abandon fixed assets or leasehold improvements before the end of its original useful life, the estimated depreciation or amortization period is revised to reflect the shortened useful life of the asset.  Other fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
  Aircraft and related equipment, which are leased out under operating leases, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Any assets received at the end of the lease are marked to the lower of cost or fair value with the adjustment recorded in other income.                      Asset

f. 
    Debt 
     Long-term debt is carried at the principal amount borrowed net of any discount/premium.  The discount is accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method over the remaining life of the underlying debt obligations. Accrued but unpaid coupon interest is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  The Company adopted a new accounting pronouncement, during the first quarter of 2016, which reclassified the unamortized debt issuance costs in our previously reported condensed consolidated statements of financial condition from other assets to a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt. Notes payable and other debt and convertible debt as of December 31, 2015 was previously presented as   $195.7 million  . Due to the retrospective application notes payable and other debt and convertible debt is now presented as   $191.0 million   as of December 31, 2015. 
  g.    Deferred rent 
  Deferred rent primarily consists of step rent, allowances from landlords and valuing the Company's lease properties in accordance with US GAAP. Step rent represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which is recorded by the Company over the term of the lease, including the build-out period. This amount is recorded as deferred rent in the early years of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and reduced in the later years of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense. Landlord allowances are generally comprised of amounts received and/or promised to the Company by landlords and may be received in the form of cash or free rent. These allowances are part of the negotiated terms of the lease. The Company records a receivable from the landlord and a deferred rent liability when the allowances are earned. This deferred rent is amortized into income (through lower rent expense) over the term (including the pre-opening build-out period) of the applicable lease, and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. Liabilities resulting from valuing the Company's leased properties acquired through business combinations are quantified by comparing the current fair value of the leased space to the current rental payments on the date of acquisition.  Deferred rent, included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is   $10.4 million   and   $12.0 million  , respectively. Deferred rent asset, included in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively.  
  h.      Insurance-related contracts 
  Premiums for insurance-related contracts are earned over the coverage period. In most cases, premiums are recognized as revenues ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly basis. For each of its contracts, the Company determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in  
  
   16 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

accordance with US GAAP. If the Company determines that a contract does not expose it to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the contract under the deposit method of accounting with any net amount receivable reflected as an asset in other assets, and any net amount payable reflected as a liability within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 
  The liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts, including reported losses.  Estimated ultimate payment amounts are based upon (1) reports of losses from policyholders, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. 
  Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to earnings after deducting amounts recovered and estimates of recoverable amounts and are included in other expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Costs of acquiring new policies, which vary with and are directly related to the production of new policies, have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Such costs include commissions and allowances as well as certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting and are included within other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.   
  Included in other revenues, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is   $8.9 million   and   $23.2 million  , respectively, related to premiums earned from the Company s insurance and reinsurance business.  Included in other expenses, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is   $8.6 million   and   $20.9 million  , respectively, are insurance and reinsurance business loss and claim reserves, acquisition costs and other expenses. 
  i.    Revenue recognition 
  Lease revenue 
    Lease revenue under operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.    
  j.    Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
           In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance which reduces the diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments in this guidance are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s cash flows presentation. 
  In March 2016, as part of its simplification initiative, the FASB issued a new accounting pronouncement which simplified the requirements for share based payments. The guidance among other things covers the income tax consequences and classification of excess tax benefit and tax withholding on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which amends and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements and most industry-specific guidance and creates a single source of revenue guidance.  The new guidance outlines the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognize revenue and related cash flows.  The guidance also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-financial assets. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In July 2015, the FASB confirmed a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted.  In 2016, the FASB issued various new guidance to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, revenue from contracts with customers and identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, as part of its simplification initiative, the FASB issued a new accounting pronouncement which eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The guidance is effective prospectively for reporting  
  
   17 

Table of Contents

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued two amendments relating to Derivatives and Hedging. The amendments clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The Second amendment relates to Contingent Put and call option in a debt instrument and clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts when assessed under the current guidance. For public business entities the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition and its disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends and supersedes its previous guidance regarding leases. The new guidance requires the lessee to recognize the right to use assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases and present them in its statement of financial condition. The recognition of these lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous GAAP. There continues to be a differentiation between finance leases and operating leases. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial condition. For public business entities the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition and its disclosures. 
  In January 2016, as a joint project with International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the FASB issued a new accounting pronouncement to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in the update made improvements to US GAAP for equity investments and investments carried at amortized cost. The guidance also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments and clarifies the need for valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities. For public business entities the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s financial condition and its disclosures.    
   
  4. Cash Collateral Pledged 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company pledged cash collateral in the amount of   $8.3 million   and   $10.1 million  , respectively, which relates to letters of credit issued to the landlords of the Company's premises in New York City, Boston and San Francisco. The Company also has a letter of credit, in the amount of   $5.5 million  , due March 2017, for which cash is pledged as collateral under a reinsurance agreement.    (See Note   13  ).   
   
  5. Investments of Operating Entities and Consolidated Funds 
           a. 
    Operating Entities 
     Securities owned, at fair value 
  Securities owned, at fair value are held by the Company and are considered held for trading. Substantially all equity securities are pledged to the clearing brokers under terms which permit the clearing broker to sell or re-pledge the securities to others subject to certain limitations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , securities owned, at fair value consisted of the following:   

18 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

(b) 
    Included in preferred stocks are investments in securities for which the Company has elected the fair value option with the fair value of   $4.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and preferred and common stock of   $7.7 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . These investments were acquired in connection with merchant banking transactions.  
        Receivable on and Payable for derivative contracts, at fair value 
  The Company's direct involvement with derivative financial instruments includes futures, currency forwards, equity swaps, credit default swaps and options. The Company's derivatives trading activities exposes the Company to certain risks, such as price and interest rate fluctuations, volatility risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets.  
  Upon issuance of the Company's cash convertible unsecured senior notes ("Convertible Notes") (See Note   13  ), the Company recognized the embedded cash conversion option at fair value of   $35.7 million   which is valued as of   September 30, 2016   at   $13.0 million   and is included in payable for derivative contracts in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial condition.  Also, on the date of issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into a separate cash convertible note economic hedge transaction (the "Hedge Transaction") with a counterparty (the  Option Counterparty ) whereby, the Company purchased a cash settled option contract with terms identical to the conversion option embedded in the Convertible Notes and simultaneously sold an equity settled warrant with a higher strike price. The Hedge Transaction is expected to reduce the Company s exposure to potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of converted notes that the Company may be required to make upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.  The Company paid a premium of   $35.7 million   for the option under the Hedge Transaction and received a premium of   $15.2 million   for the equity settled warrant transaction, for a net cost of   $20.5 million  .  The Hedge Transaction is valued at   $13.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and is included in receivable on derivative contracts in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. Aside from the initial premium paid, the Company will not be required to make any cash payments under the Hedge Transaction and could be entitled to receive an amount of cash from the Option Counterparty generally equal to the amount by which the market price per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of the Hedge Transaction during the relevant valuation period.  The warrants cover   28,048,786   shares of the Company's Class A common stock and have an initial exercise price of   $7.18   per share.  The warrants expire over a period of   80   trading days beginning on November 14, 2018.  The warrant transaction could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Company s Class A common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.     
  The Company's long and short exposure to derivatives is as follows:   

  (a) Includes index, equity, commodity future and cash conversion options.  
  
   19

           (a) 
    Includes financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting provisions that are permitted to be offset to the extent an event of default has occurred. 
              (b) 
    Includes the amount of collateral held or posted. 
     The realized and unrealized gains/(losses) related to derivatives trading activities were   $(2.8) million   and   $(0.2) million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $(10.4) million   and   $(5.6) million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.   
  Pursuant to the various derivatives transactions discussed above, except for the cash convertible note hedge (see Note   13  ) and exchange traded derivatives, the Company is required to post/receive collateral.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , collateral consisting of   $23.1 million   and   $27.1 million   of cash, respectively, is included in receivable from brokers and payable to brokers on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   all derivative contracts were with multiple major financial institutions.

              (2) 
    Equity method investments 
     Equity method investments include investments held by the Company in several operating companies whose operations primarily include the day to day management of a number of real estate funds, including the portfolio management and administrative services related to the acquisition, disposition, and active monitoring of the real estate funds' underlying debt and equity investments. The Company's ownership interests in these equity method investments range from   20%   to   55%  . The Company holds a majority of the outstanding ownership interest (i.e., more than 50%) in RCG Longview Partners II, LLC. The operating agreement that governs the management of day-to-day operations and affairs of this entity stipulates that certain decisions require support and approval from other members in addition to the support and approval of the Company. As a result, all operating decisions made in this entity requires the support of both the Company and an affirmative vote of a majority of the other managing members who are not affiliates of the Company. As the Company does not possess control over any of these entities, the presumption of consolidation has been overcome pursuant to current accounting standards and the Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. Also included in equity method investments are the investments in (a) HealthCare Royalty Partners General Partners and (b) Starboard Value (and certain related parties) which serves as an operating company whose operations primarily include the day to day management (including portfolio management) of several activist hedge funds and related managed accounts and c) Surf House Ocean Views Holdings, LLC which is a joint venture in a real estate development project.  The Company recorded no impairment charges in relation to its equity method investments for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015.

The following table summarizes equity method investments held by the Company:   

For the period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   one   equity method investment held by the Company has met the significance criteria as defined under SEC guidance. As such, the Company is required to present summarized financial information for the significant investee for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and such information is as follows. 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's share of losses in its equity method investment in RCG Longview Partners II, LLC has exceeded the carrying amount recorded in this investee. These amounts are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  RCG Longview Partners II, LLC, as general partner to a real estate fund, has reversed previously recorded incentive income allocations and has recorded a current clawback obligation to the limited partners in the fund. This obligation is due to a change in unrealized value of the fund on which there have previously been distributed carried interest realizations; however, the settlement of a potential obligation is not due until the end of the life of the respective fund. As the Company is obligated to return previous distributions it received from RCG Longview Partners II, LLC, it has continued to record its share of gains/losses in the investee including reflecting its share of the clawback obligation in the amount of   $6.2 million  .  
  The Company's income (loss) from equity method investments was a loss of $  0.1 million   and   $5.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and a gain of   $16.0 million   and   $3.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and is included in net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value 
  Securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value represent obligations of the Company to deliver a specified security at a contracted price and, thereby, create a liability to purchase that security at prevailing prices. The Company's liability for securities to be delivered is measured at their fair value as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. However, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk, as the Company's ultimate cost to satisfy the delivery of securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value may exceed the amount reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Substantially all equity securities and options are pledged to the clearing broker under terms which permit the

clearing broker to sell or re-pledge the securities to others subject to certain limitations. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value consisted of the following: 

Variable Interest Entities 
  The total assets and liabilities of the variable interest entities for which the Company has concluded that it holds a variable interest, but for which it is not the primary beneficiary, are   $5.1 billion   and   $0.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 billion   and   $473.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  In addition, the maximum exposure relating to these variable interest entities as of   September 30, 2016   was   $483.9 million  , and as of   December 31, 2015   was   $327.8 million  , all of which is included in other investments, at fair value in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The exposure to loss primarily relates to the Consolidated Feeder Funds' investment in their Unconsolidated Master Funds and the Company's investment in unconsolidated investment companies.  
           b. 
    Consolidated Funds 
     Securities owned, at fair value

approach to investing, primarily in the securities of issuers engaged in, or subject to, announced (or unannounced but otherwise anticipated) extraordinary corporate transactions, which may include, but are not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, tender offers, hostile takeover bids, sale processes, exchange offers, and recapitalizations.  Merger Master invests in the securities of one or more issuers engaged in or subject to such extraordinary corporate transactions. Merger Master typically seeks to derive a profit by realizing the price differential, or  spread,  between the market price of securities purchased or sold short and the market price or value of securities realized in connection with the completion or termination of the extraordinary corporate transaction, or in connection with the adjustment of market prices in anticipation thereof, while seeking to minimize the market risk associated with the aforementioned investment activities.  Merger Master will, depending on markets conditions, generally focus the majority of its investment program on announced transactions. If the investment manager of Merger Master considers it necessary, it may either alone or as part of a group, also initiate shareholder actions seeking to maximize value. Such shareholder actions may include, but are not limited to, re-orienting management s focus or initiating the sale of the company (or one or more of its divisions) to a third party.  There are no unfunded commitments at Merger Fund.

(a)   In accordance with US GAAP, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition.      
  (b) In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreements for acquisitions that closed during 2012 and the third and fourth quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016, the Company is required to pay to the sellers a portion of future net income of the acquired businesses, if certain revenue targets are achieved through the periods ended August 2016, December 2018, December 2020, and June 2018, respectively. The Company estimated the contingent consideration liability using the income approach (discounted cash flow method) which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future cash flows and profits. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts recognized. The undiscounted amounts as of   September 30, 2016   can range from   $0.1 million   to   $16.3 million  .

December 2020, respectively. The Company estimated the contingent consideration liability using the income approach (discounted cash flow method) which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future cash flows and profits. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts recognized. The undiscounted amounts as of December 31, 2015 can range from   $0.1 million   to   $10.0 million  .  
  The following table includes a rollforward of the amounts for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for financial instruments classified within level 3.  The classification of a financial instrument within level 3 is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

         statements of operations. 
  (a)  The investment was converted to equity. 
  (b)  The company transferred investments to a consolidated fund.  
  All realized and unrealized gains (losses) in the table above are reflected in other income (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above.   
  The Company recognizes all transfers and the related unrealized gain (loss) at the beginning of the reporting period. 
  Transfers between level 1 and 2 generally relate to whether the principal market for the security becomes active or inactive. Transfers between level 2 and 3 generally relate to whether significant relevant observable inputs are available for the fair value measurements or due to change in liquidity restrictions for the investments. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were   no   transfers between level 1 and level 2 assets and liabilities.

The following table includes quantitative information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for financial instruments classified within level 3. The table below quantifies information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's level 3 financial instruments.  

(a) 
    The quantitative disclosures exclude financial instruments for which the determination of fair value is based on prices from prior transactions.    
     The Company has established valuation policies and procedures and an internal control infrastructure over its fair value measurement of financial instruments which includes ongoing oversight by the valuation committee as well as periodic audits performed by the Company's internal audit group. The valuation committee is comprised of senior management, including non-investment professionals, who are responsible for overseeing and monitoring the pricing of the Company's investments, including the review of the results of the independent price verification process, approval of new trading asset classes and use of applicable pricing models and approaches. 
  
   34 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The US GAAP fair value leveling hierarchy is designated and monitored on an ongoing basis. In determining the designation, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors including the observability of inputs, liquidity of the investment and the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement. Designations, models, pricing vendors, third party valuation providers and inputs used to derive fair market value are subject to review by the valuation committee and the internal audit group. The Company reviews its valuation policy guidelines on an ongoing basis and may adjust them in light of, improved valuation metrics and models, the availability of reliable inputs and information, and prevailing market conditions. The Company reviews a daily profit and loss report, as well as other periodic reports, and analyzes material changes from period-to-period in the valuation of its investments as part of its control procedures. The Company also performs back testing on a regular basis by comparing prices observed in executed transactions to previous valuations. 
  The fair market value for level 3 securities may be highly sensitive to the use of industry standard models, unobservable inputs and subjective assumptions. The degree of fair market value sensitivity is also contingent upon the subjective weight given to specific inputs and valuation metrics. The Company holds various equity and debt instruments where different weight may be applied to industry standard models representing standard valuation metrics such as: discounted cash flows, market multiples, comparative transactions, capital rates, recovery rates and timing, and bid levels. Generally, changes in the weights ascribed to the various valuation metrics and the significant unobservable inputs in isolation may result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Volatility levels for warrants and options are not readily observable and subject to interpretation. Changes in capital rates, discount rates and replacement costs could significantly increase or decrease the valuation of the real estate investments. The interrelationship between unobservable inputs may vary significantly amongst level 3 securities as they are generally highly idiosyncratic. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation can result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
  Other financial assets and liabilities 
  The following table presents the carrying values and fair values, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , of financial assets and liabilities and information on their classification within the fair value hierarchy which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value see Note   3  .   

(b) 
    The convertible debt include the conversion option and is based on the last broker quote available.  
      
  7. Receivables from and Payable to Brokers 
           Receivables from and payable to brokers includes cash held at the clearing brokers, amounts receivable or payable for unsettled transactions, monies borrowed and proceeds from short sales (including commissions and fees related to securities transactions) equal to the fair value of securities sold, not yet purchased, which are restricted until the Company purchases the securities sold short. Pursuant to the master netting agreements the Company entered into with its brokers, these balances are presented net (assets less liabilities) across balances with the same broker. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , receivable from brokers was   $77.6 million   and   $117.8 million  , respectively. Payable to brokers was   $127.2 million   and $  131.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company's receivables from and payable to brokers balances are held at multiple financial institutions.

8. Goodwill 
  In accordance with US GAAP, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at an interim period if events or changed circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under US GAAP, the Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform the two-step approach.  Periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge.   
  In connection with the CRT transaction (See Note   2  ), in May 2016, the Company recognized goodwill of   $3.5 million   and intangible assets (including customer relationships, trade name, intellectual property and non-compete arrangements) with an estimated fair value of   $5.1 million   which are included within intangible assets, net in the condensed consolidation statements of financial condition with the expected useful lives ranging from   1   to   9   years with a weighted average useful life of   8.1 years  .  Amortization expense related to intangibles from the CRT acquisition for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million   respectively.  Goodwill, which primarily relates to expected synergies from combining operations, is fully deductible for tax purposes and has been assigned to the broker-dealer segment of the Company.  
  On September 23, 2016, the Company and the portfolio managers of   RASL   completed the sale of their respective ownership interests in RASL, an investment advisor  .  In contemplation with the sale transaction, the Company allocated   $1.2 million   of goodwill to the RASL disposal group (See Note   2  ).   
  The Company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis at the time of the sale transaction and   no   impairment charges for goodwill were recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
   
  9. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries and Funds 
  Redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries and funds and the related net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries and funds are comprised as follows:   

10. Share-Based and Deferred Compensation and Employee Ownership Plans 
  The Company issues share based compensation under the 2006 Equity and Incentive Plan, the 2007 Equity and Incentive Plan (both established prior to the November 2009 transaction between Ramius and Cowen) and the Cowen Group, Inc. 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan (collectively, the  Equity Plans ). The Equity Plans permit the grant of options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights ("SAR's") and other equity based awards to the Company's employees and directors.  Stock options granted generally vest over   two  -to-  five  -year periods and expire   seven   years from the date of grant. Restricted shares and restricted share units issued may be immediately vested or may generally vest over a   two  -to-  five  -year period. SAR's vest and expire after   five   years from grant date. Awards are subject to the risk of forfeiture.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   1.8 million   shares available for future issuance under the Equity Plans.  
  Under the 2010 Equity Plan, the Company awarded   $25.9 million   of deferred cash awards to its employees during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . These awards vest over a   four   year period and accrue interest between   0.70%   to   0.75%

per year.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unrecognized compensation expense related to deferred cash awards of   $37.3 million  .  
  The Company measures compensation cost for share based awards according to the equity method. In accordance with the expense recognition provisions of those standards, the Company amortizes unearned compensation associated with share based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the option or award. In relation to awards under the Equity Plans, the Company recognized compensation expense of   $6.2 million   and   $5.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $19.3 million   and   $16.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The income tax effect recognized for the Equity Plans was a benefit of   $2.5 million   and   $2.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $8.6 million   and   $2.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  The Company values options and SAR's on grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model which requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the expected term, volatility, risk-free rate and dividend yield: 
            Expected term  .    Expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company elected to use the "simplified" calculation method, as applicable to companies that lack extensive historical data. The mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. 
            Expected volatility  .    The Company bases its expected volatility on its own stock price history. 
            Risk free rate  .    The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the award is based on the interest rate of a traded zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the awards' expected term on the date of grant. 
            Dividend yield  .    The Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the assumed dividend yield is   zero  . 
  The following table summarizes the Company's stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  :   

   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's stock options were fully expensed. 
  The following table summarizes the Company's SAR's for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  :

Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees 
  Restricted shares and restricted stock units are referred to collectively as restricted stock. The following table summarizes the Company's restricted share and restricted stock unit activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

(1)  Performance linked restricted stock units of   1,925,750   were awarded to employees of the Company in December 2013 and January 2014.  An additional   2,800,000   performance linked restricted stock units were awarded in March 2016.  Of the awards granted,   387,500   have been forfeited through   September 30, 2016  .  The remaining awards, included in the outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016  , will vest between March 2019 and December 2020 and will be earned only to the extent that the Company attains specified market goals relating to its volume-weighted average share price and total shareholder return in relation to certain benchmark indices and performance goals relating to aggregate net income and average return on shareholder equity. The actual number of RSUs ultimately earned could vary from zero, if performance goals are not met, to as much as 150% of the targeted award. Each RSU is equal to the one share of the Company s Class A common stock.   Compensation expense is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the Company will attain the performance goals.  
  The fair value of restricted stock (excluding performance linked units which are valued using the Monte Carlo valuation model) is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $65.3 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to the Company's grant of nonvested restricted shares and restricted stock units to employees. Unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted shares and restricted stock units granted to employees is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.69   years.

  There were   224,398   restricted stock units awarded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016   there were   648,704   restricted stock units outstanding. 
   
  11. Income Taxes 
  The taxable results of the Company s U.S. operations are included in the consolidated income tax returns of Cowen Group, Inc. as well as stand-alone state and local tax returns. The Company has subsidiaries that are resident in foreign countries where tax filings have to be submitted on a stand alone basis. These subsidiaries are subject to tax in their respective countries and the Company is responsible for and, thus, reports all taxes incurred by these subsidiaries. The countries where the Company owns subsidiaries that file tax returns are United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Gibraltar, and Hong Kong. 
  The Company calculates its U.S. tax provision using the estimated annual effective tax rate methodology. The tax expense or benefit caused by an unusual or infrequent item is recorded in the quarter in which it occurs. The Company uses the discrete methodology to calculate its income tax provision for its foreign subsidiaries. Based on these methodologies, the Company s effective income tax rate was   24.77%   and   17.81%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the unusual or infrequent items whose tax impact were recorded discretely related primarily to Federal, state taxes and the tax provisions of the Company s foreign subsidiaries. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to disposal of investment, state and foreign taxes, as well as other nondeductible expenses.  
  The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax benefit or expense that will result from differences between the carrying value of its assets for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes, as well as for

operating or capital loss and tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance is recorded to bring the net deferred tax assets to a level that, in management's view, is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future. This level will be estimated based on a number of factors, especially the amount of net deferred tax assets of the Company that are actually expected to be realized, for tax purposes, in the foreseeable future.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to its foreign net operating losses.  
  The Company is subject to examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service, the United Kingdom Inland Revenue Service, the Luxembourg Tax Office as well as state, local and foreign tax authorities in jurisdictions where the Company has significant business operations, such as New York. Currently, the Company is under audit by New York State for the 2010 to 2012 tax years. Management is not expecting a material tax liability from this audit. 
  The Company intends to permanently reinvest the capital and accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the respective subsidiary, but remits the current earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to the United States to the extent permissible under local regulatory rules.  The undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries totaled     $1.1 million   and   $1.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   respectively, and the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted to the United States would be approximately     $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
   
  12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Lease Obligations  
  The Company has entered into leases for office space and equipment. These leases contain rent escalation clauses. The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any rent holiday periods. Rent expense was   $4.9 million   and   $4.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $15.4 million   and   $13.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

           (a) 
    Equipment Leases include the Company's commitments relating to operating and capital leases. See Note   13   for further information on the capital lease minimum payments which are included in the table.   
      Clawback Obligations 
  For financial reporting purposes, the general partners of a real estate fund have recorded a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners, due to changes in the unrealized value of the fund's remaining investments and where the fund's general partner has previously received carried interest distributions.     The clawback liability, however, is not realized until the end of the fund's life.     The life of the real estate funds with a potential clawback obligation is currently in a winding-up phase whereby the remaining assets of the fund are being liquidated as promptly as possible so as to maximize value, however a final date for liquidation has not been set.      The fund is currently winding-down   and as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the clawback obligation was   $6.2 million  . 
  The Company serves as the general partner/managing member and/or investment manager to various affiliated and sponsored funds. As such, the Company is contingently liable for obligations for those entities. These amounts are not included above as the Company believes that the assets in these funds are sufficient to discharge any liabilities.

  In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors and employees (the "Company and Related Parties")   are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of securities, banking, anti-fraud, anti-money laundering, employment and other statutory and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief.

The Company discloses a contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred and there is no reserve for the loss because the conditions above are not met. The Company's disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters, for which an estimate can be made.  Neither a reserve nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote  .               
  The Company appropriately reserves for certain matters where, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of liability is probable and the extent of such liability is reasonably estimable. Such amounts are included within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the     accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and currently available information and involve a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the type and nature of the litigation, claim or proceeding, the progress of the matter, the advice of legal counsel, the Company's defenses and its experience in similar cases or proceedings as well as its assessment of matters, including settlements, involving other defendants in similar or related cases or proceedings.

  14. Stockholder's Equity 
  Preferred Stock and Purchase of Capped Call Option 
  On May 19, 2015, the Company completed its offering of     120,750     shares of the Company's     5.625%     Series A cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock ("Series A Convertible Preferred Stock") that provided     $117.2 million     of proceeds, net of underwriting fees and issuance costs of     $3.6 million  .  Each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to dividends at a rate of     5.625%     per annum     which will be payable, when and if declared by the board of directors of the Company, quarterly, in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year.  The Company may, at its option, pay dividends in cash, common stock or a combination thereof  .   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company declared and accrued a cash dividend of   $5.1 million  . 
  Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is non-voting and has a liquidity preference over the Company's Class A common stock and ranks senior to all classes or series of the Company's Class A common stock, but junior to all of the Company's existing and future indebtedness with respect to divided rights and rights upon the Company's involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding down.    
  Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into a number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to the liquidation preference of     $1,000     divided by the conversion rate.  The initial conversion rate is     152.2476     shares     (which equates to     $6.57   per share)     of the Company's Class A common stock for each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. At any time on or after May 20, 2020, the Company may elect to convert all outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of the Company s Class A common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, in each case, based on the then-applicable conversion rate, if the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds   150%     of the then-current conversion price on at least     20     trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of     30     consecutive trading days (including on the last trading day of such period) immediately prior to such election.      At the time of conversion, the conversion rate may be adjusted based on certain events including but not limited to the issuance of cash dividends or Class A common stock as a dividends to the Company's Class A common shareholders or a share split or combination.    
  In connection with the issuance and sale of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company entered into a privately negotiated capped call option transaction (the  Capped Call Option Transaction ) with Nomura Global Financial Products Inc. (the  option counterparty ) for     $15.9 million  .   The Capped Call Option Transaction is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s Class A common stock (if the Company elects to convert to common shares) and/or offset any cash payments that the Company is required to make upon conversion of any Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  The Capped Call Option Transaction has an initial effective strike price of     $6.57   per share, which matches the initial conversion price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and a cap price of     $8.39     per share.  However, to the extent that the market price of Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Option Transaction, exceeds the cap  
  
   43

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

price thereof, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or such cash payments would not be offset.  As the Capped Call Option Transaction is a free standing derivative that is indexed to the Company's own stock price and the Company controls if it is settled in cash or stock it qualifies for equity classification as a reduction to additional paid in capital.  
  Treasury Stock 
  Treasury stock of   $152.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $137.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , resulted from   $8.8 million   acquired through repurchases of shares to cover employee minimum tax withholding obligations related to stock compensation vesting events under the Company's Equity Plan or other similar transactions and   $6.0 million   purchased in connection with a share repurchase program.  
  The following represents the activity relating to the treasury stock held by the Company during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  :  

15. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income includes the after tax change in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments. During the periods presented, the Company did not have material reclassifications out of other comprehensive income.  

16. Earnings Per Share 
  The Company calculates its basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with US GAAP. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the Company's common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   107,314,157   shares outstanding.  The Company has included   648,704   fully vested, unissued restricted stock units in its calculation of basic earnings per share. 
  Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive items. The Company uses the treasury stock method to reflect the potential dilutive effect of the warrants (see Note   5  (a)), unexercised stock options, unvested restricted shares, restricted stock units, and SAR's. In calculating the number of dilutive shares outstanding, the shares of common stock underlying unvested restricted shares and restricted stock units are assumed to have been delivered, and options and warrants are assumed to have been exercised, on the grant date. The assumed proceeds from the assumed vesting, delivery and exercising were calculated as the sum of (a) the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized and (b) the amount of tax benefit that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming vesting and delivery of the shares. The tax benefit is the amount resulting from a tax deduction for compensation in excess of compensation expense recognized for financial statement reporting purposes. All outstanding stock options, SAR's, unvested restricted shares and warrants were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The Company can elect to settle the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in shares, cash, or a combination of both.  The Company's intent is to settle in cash and, based on current and projected liquidity needs, the Company has the ability to do so.

The computation of earnings per share is as follows:   

17. Segment Reporting 
  The Company conducts its operations through   two   segments: the alternative investment segment and the broker dealer segment. These activities are conducted primarily in the United States and substantially all of its revenues are generated domestically. The performance measure for these segments is Economic Income (Loss), which management uses to evaluate the financial performance of and make operating decisions for the segments including determining appropriate compensation levels.  Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including headcount, square footage and other factors. 
     In general, Economic Income (Loss) is a pre-tax measure that (i) eliminates the impact of consolidation for consolidated funds (ii) excludes goodwill and intangible impairment (iii) excludes certain other acquisition-related adjustments and/or reorganization expenses and (iv) excludes preferred stock dividends.      In addition, Economic Income (Loss) revenues include investment income that represents the income the Company has earned in investing its own capital, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest and dividends, net of associated investment related expenses. For US GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items. Economic Income (Loss) revenues also include management fees, incentive income and investment income earned through the Company's investment as a general partner in certain real estate entities and the Company's investment in the activist business. For US GAAP purposes, all of these items are recorded in other income (loss). In addition, Economic Income (Loss) expenses are reduced by reimbursement from affiliates, which for US GAAP purposes is presented gross as part of revenue.     
  As further stated below, one major difference between Economic Income (Loss) and US GAAP net income (loss) is that Economic Income (Loss) presents the segments' results of operations without the impact resulting from the full consolidation of any of the Consolidated Funds. Consolidation of these funds results in including in income the pro rata share of the income or loss attributable to other owners of such entities which is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. This pro rata share has no effect on the overall financial performance for the alternative investment segment, as ultimately, this income or loss is not income or loss for the alternative investment segment itself. Included in Economic Income (Loss) is the actual pro rata share of the income or loss attributable to the Company as an investor in such entities, which is relevant in management making operating decisions and evaluating financial performance. 
  The following tables set forth operating results for the Company's alternative investment and broker-dealer segments and related adjustments necessary to reconcile the Company's Economic Income (Loss) measure to arrive at the Company's consolidated US GAAP net income (loss):

The following is a summary of the adjustments made to US GAAP net income (loss) for the segment to arrive at 
  Economic Income (Loss): 
  Funds Consolidation:   The impacts of consolidation and the related elimination entries of the Consolidated Funds are not included in Economic Income (Loss). Adjustments to reconcile to US GAAP net income (loss) include elimination of incentive income and management fees earned from the Consolidated Funds and addition of fund expenses excluding management fees paid, fund revenues and investment income (loss). 
  Other Adjustments: 
  (a)     Economic Income (Loss) recognizes revenues (i) net of distribution fees paid to agents and (ii) our proportionate share  
  of management and incentive fees of certain real estate operating entities and the activist business. 
  (b)    Economic Income (Loss) excludes income taxes and acquisition related adjustments as management does not consider 
                 these items when evaluating the performance of the segment.  
  (c)     Economic Income (Loss) recognizes Company income from proprietary trading (including interest and dividends) and 
                 underwriting income from the Company's insurance related activities net of expenses. 
  (d)     Economic Income (Loss) recognizes the Company's proportionate share of expenses for certain real estate and other  
  operating entities for which the investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting for investments. 
  (e)    Reimbursement from affiliates is shown as a reduction of Economic Income expenses, but is included as a part of  
  revenues under US GAAP. 
  (f)    Aircraft lease revenue is shown net of expenses in other revenue for Economic Income (Loss).  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, there was   no     one   fund or other customer which represented more than   10%   of the Company's total revenues.

  Cowen s Luxembourg reinsurance companies, Vianden RCG Re SCA ( Vianden ) and Hollenfels, are required to maintain a solvency capital ratio   as calculated by relevant European Commission directives and local regulatory rules in Luxembourg. Each company s solvency capital ratio as of     September 30, 2016     was in excess of this minimum requirement.    
  Based on minimum capital and surplus requirements pursuant to the laws of the state of New York that apply to captive insurance companies, RCG Insurance Company, Cowen s captive insurance company incorporated and licensed in the state of New York, was required to maintain capital and surplus of approximately     $0.3 million     as of     September 30, 2016  .  RCG Insurance Company s capital and surplus as of   September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   $22.1 million  . 
   
  19. Related Party Transactions 
  The Company and its affiliated entities are the managing member, general partner and/or investment manager to the Company's alternative asset management products and certain managed accounts. Management fees and incentive income are primarily earned from affiliated entities.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $5.9 million   and   $6.3 million  , respectively, included in fees receivable are earned from related parties. The Company may, at its discretion, reimburse certain fees charged to the funds that it manages to avoid duplication of fees when such funds have an underlying investment in another affiliated investment fund.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reimbursed the funds it manages   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, which were recorded net in management fees and incentive income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operation.  These amounts were immaterial for the three and   nine months ended   September 30, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , related amounts still payable were   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, and were reflected in fees payable in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  Fees receivable and fees payable are recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value. 
  The Company may also make loans to employees or other affiliates, excluding executive officers of the Company. These              loans are interest bearing and settle pursuant to the agreed-upon terms with such employees or affiliates and are included in due from related parties in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans to employees of   $7.9 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, were included in due from related parties on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company does not make loans to its executive officers.  Of these amounts   $2.1 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively, are related to forgivable loans. These forgivable loans provide for a cash payment up-front to employees, with the amount due back to the Company forgiven over a vesting period.  An employee that voluntarily ceases employment, or is terminated with cause, is generally required to pay back to the Company any unvested forgivable loans granted to them.  The forgivable loans are recorded as an asset to the Company  
  
   50 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

on the date of grant and payment, and then amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  The vesting period on forgivable loans is generally   one   to   three   years. The Company recorded compensation expense of   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $0.9 million   and   $2.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  This expense is included in employee compensation and benefits in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the interest income was insignificant for all related party loans and advances.  
  Included in due to related parties is approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to a subordination agreement with an investor in certain real estate funds. This total is based on a hypothetical liquidation of the real estate funds as of the balance sheet date.  
  Included in due from related parties is   $12.9 million   related to a sale, in December of 2015, of a portion of the Company's ownership interest in the activist business of Starboard Value to the Starboard principals.  It is being financed through the profits of the relevant Starboard entities over a five year period and earns interest at   5%   per annum.  The interest income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. 
  The remaining balance included in due from related parties of   $11.7 million   and   $19.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, relates to amounts due to the Company from affiliated funds and real estate entities due to expenses paid on their behalf.  
  Employees and certain other related parties invest on a discretionary basis within consolidated entities. These investments generally are subject to preferential management fee and performance fee arrangements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , such investments aggregated $  27.7 million   and $  21.3 million  , respectively, were included in redeemable non-controlling interests on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Their share of the net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries and funds aggregated   $2.9 million   and   $5.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and $  4.2 million   and $  10.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
   
  20. Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Guarantees 
  US GAAP requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. Those standards define guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying security (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Those standards also define guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity's failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 
  In the normal course of its operations, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Company's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
  The Company indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the Company or its affiliates. The Company also indemnifies some clients against potential losses incurred in the event specified third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers, improperly execute transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. However, the Company believes that it is unlikely it will have to make significant payments under these arrangements and has not recorded any contingent liability in the condensed consolidated financial statements for these indemnifications. 
  The Company also provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The Company may also provide standard indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or adverse application of certain tax laws. These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. However, the Company believes it is unlikely it will have to make material payments under these arrangements and  
  
   51 

Table of Contents  
  Cowen Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

has not recorded any contingent liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for these indemnifications. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . However, through indemnification provisions in the clearing agreement, customer activities may expose the Company to off-balance-sheet credit risk. Pursuant to the clearing agreement, the Company is required to reimburse the Company's clearing broker, without limit, for any losses incurred due to a counterparty's failure to satisfy its contractual obligations. However, these transactions are collateralized by the underlying security, thereby reducing the associated risk to changes in the market value of the security through the settlement date.   
  In addition, during the normal course of business, the Company has exposure to a number of risks including market risk, currency risk, credit risk, operational risk, liquidity risk and legal risk. As part of the Company's risk management process, these risks are monitored on a regular basis throughout the course of the year. 
   
  21. Subsequent Events    
  The Company has evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
             This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the section titled  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes of Cowen Group, Inc. included elsewhere in this quarterly report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
   
  Overview  
  Cowen Group, Inc. (the "Company") is a diversified financial services firm and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, "Cowen", "Cowen Group" or the "Company"), provides alternative investment management,   investment banking, research, sales and trading and prime brokerage   services through its two business segments: alternative investment and broker-dealer. The alternative investment segment includes   hedge funds, private equity structures, registered investment companies and listed vehicles  . The broker-dealer segment offers industry focused investment banking for growth-oriented companies including advisory and global capital markets origination and domain knowledge-driven research and a sales and trading platform for institutional investors. 
  Ramius is an alternative investment platform offering innovative products and solutions across the liquidity spectrum to institutional and private clients.  The predecessor to this business was founded in 1994 and, through one of its subsidiaries, has been a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 since 1997.  Ramius offers investors access to strategies to meet their specific needs including long/short equity, activist equity, event driven equity, event driven credit, global macro, managed futures, health care royalties and private real estate.  Ramius focuses on attracting and retaining talented in-house and affiliated investment teams and providing them with institutional infrastructure, robust sales and marketing and industry knowledge.  A significant portion of the Company s capital is invested alongside Ramius s alternative investment clients.  The Company has also invested some of its capital in its recently formed aviation and reinsurance businesses.      Our alte  rnative investment business had approximately   $10.5   billion of assets under management as of   October 1, 2016  .  See the section titled "Assets Under Management and Fund Performance" for further analysis.  
  Our broker-dealer businesses include   research, sales and trading, prime brokerage and investment banking services to companies and primarily institutional investor clients  .  Our primary target sectors ("Target Sectors") are   healthcare, technology, media and telecommunications, information and technology services, consumer, aerospace and defense, industrials,     and energy and transportation  .   We provide research and brokerage services to over 1,000 domestic and international clients seeking to trade securities and debt instruments, principally in our target sectors.     The broker-dealer segment also offers a full-service suite of     introduced prime brokerage services targeting emerging hedge fund managers  .     Historically, we have focused our investment banking efforts on small to mid-capitalization public companies as well as private companies.  From time to time, the Company invests in private capital raising transactions of its investment banking clients. 
   
  Certain Factors Impacting Our Business  
  Our alternative investment business and results of operations are impacted by the following factors: 
             
    Assets under management.    Our revenues from management fees are directly linked to assets under management. As a result, the future performance of our alternative investment business will depend on, among other things, our ability to retain assets under management and to grow assets under management from existing and new products. In addition, positive performance increases assets under management which results in higher management fees.  
                
    Investment performance.    Our revenues from incentive income are linked to the performance of the funds and accounts that we manage. Performance also affects assets under management because it influences investors' decisions to invest assets in, or withdraw assets from, the funds and accounts managed by us. 
                
    Fee and allocation rates.    Our management fee revenues are linked to the management fee rates we charge as a percentage of assets under management. Our incentive income revenues are linked to the incentive allocation rates we charge as a percentage of performance-driven asset growth. Our incentive allocations are generally subject to  high-water marks,  whereby incentive income is generally earned by us only to the extent that the net asset value of a fund at the end of a measurement period exceeds the highest net asset value as of the end of the earlier measurement period for which we earned incentive income. Our incentive allocations, in some cases, are subject to performance hurdles.   
                
    Investment performance of our own capital.    We invest our own capital and the performance of such invested capital affects our revenues.  

53 

Table of Contents   

Our broker-dealer business and results of operations are impacted by the following factors: 
             
    Underwriting, private placement and strategic/financial advisory fees.    Our revenues from investment banking are directly linked to the underwriting fees we earn in equity and debt securities offerings in which the Company acts as an underwriter, private placement fees earned in non-underwritten transactions, sales commissions earned in at-the-market offerings and success fees earned in connection with advising both buyers and sellers, principally in mergers and acquisitions. As a result, the future performance of our investment banking business will depend on, among other things, our ability to secure lead manager and co-manager roles in clients capital raising transactions as well as our ability to secure mandates as a client's strategic financial advisor. 
                
    Commissions.    Our commission revenues depend for the most part on our customer trading volumes.   
                
    Principal transactions.   Principal transactions revenue includes net trading gains and losses from the Company's market-making activities and net trading gains and losses on inventory and other firm positions. Commissions associated with these transactions are also included herein. In certain cases, the Company provides liquidity to clients buying or selling blocks of shares of listed stocks without previously identifying the other side of the trade at execution, which subjects the Company to market risk. 
                
    Equity and credit research fees.    Equity and credit research fees are paid to the Company for providing equity and credit research. The Company also permits institutional customers to allocate a portion of their commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties. Our ability to generate revenues relating to our equity and credit research depends on the quality of our research and its relevance to our institutional customers and other clients. 
                
    Investment performance of our own capital.    Investment income in the broker-dealer business includes gains and losses generated by the capital the Company invests in private capital raising transactions of its investment banking clients.  Our revenues from investment income are linked to the performance of the underlying investments. 
     External Factors Impacting Our Business 
  Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. We believe a favorable business environment is characterized by many factors, including a stable geopolitical climate, transparent financial markets, low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment, strong business profitability and high business and investor confidence. Unfavorable or uncertain economic or market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability (or increases in the cost of) credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, exchange rate volatility, unfavorable global asset allocation trends, outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability, corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in the capital markets, or a combination of these or other factors. Our businesses and profitability have been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions in many ways, including the following: 
             
    Our broker-dealer business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by market conditions. Increased competition continues to affect our investment banking and capital markets businesses. The same factors also affect trading volumes in secondary financial markets, which affect our brokerage business. Commission rates, market volatility, increased competition from larger financial firms and other factors also affect our brokerage revenues and may cause these revenues to vary from period to period. 
                
    Our broker-dealer business focuses primarily on small to mid-capitalization and private companies in specific industry sectors. These sectors may experience growth or downturns independent of general economic and market conditions, or may face market conditions that are disproportionately better or worse than those impacting the economy and markets generally. In addition, increased government regulation has had, and may continue to have, a disproportionate effect on capital formation by smaller companies.  Therefore, our broker-dealer business could be affected differently than overall market trends. 
                
    Our alternative investment business can be adversely affected by unanticipated levels of requested redemptions. We experienced significant levels of requested redemptions during the 2008 financial crisis and, while the environment for investing in alternative investment products has since improved, it is possible that we could intermittently experience redemptions above historical levels, regardless of fund performance.  
     Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings. Our results in any period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally. We are also subject to various legal and regulatory actions that impact our business and financial results.

  On August 1, 2016, the Company announced that the Washington Research Group had joined the Company. The Cowen Washington Research Group is well known to institutional portfolio managers for high quality and in-depth work that draws on decades of policy-related experience.    
  On September 23, 2016, the Company and the portfolio managers of     Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC     ("RASL")     completed the sale of their respective ownership interests in RASL, an investment advisor  .    RASL offered a range of customized hedge fund investment solutions with approximately     $2.5 billion     in client assets.    
   
  Basis of presentation 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company in this Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP") as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") through Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles in the preparation of financial statements and include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, and entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or a substantive, controlling general partner interest. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain fund entities that are consolidated in the condensed consolidated financial statements, are not subject to these consolidation provisions with respect to their own investments pursuant to their specialized accounting. 
  The Company serves as the managing member/general partner and/or investment manager to affiliated fund entities which it sponsors and manages. Certain of these funds in which the Company has a substantive, controlling general partner interest are consolidated with the Company pursuant to US GAAP as described below (the  Consolidated Funds ). Consequently, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of these funds on a gross basis. The ownership interests in these funds which are not owned by the Company are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries in the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The management fees and incentive income earned by the Company from these funds are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Revenue recognition 
  Our principal sources of revenue are derived from two segments: an alternative investment segment and a broker-dealer segment, as more fully described below.  
  Our alternative investment segment generates revenue through three principal sources: management fees, incentive income and investment income from the Company's own capital. 
  Our broker-dealer segment generates revenue through three principal sources: investment banking, brokerage and investment income.  
  Management fees  
  The Company earns management fees from affiliated funds and certain managed accounts that it serves as the investment manager based on assets under management. The actual management fees received vary depending on distribution fees or fee splits paid to third parties either in connection with raising the assets or structuring the investment.  
  Management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis at the beginning of each quarter in arrears and are prorated for capital inflows and redemptions. While some investors may have separately negotiated fees, in general the management fees are as follows:  
             
    Hedge Funds.   Management fees for the Company's hedge funds are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of assets under management or notional trading level. Management fees are generally calculated monthly based on assets under management at the end of each month before incentive income  .   
                
    Registered Funds.   Management fees for the Company s registered funds (State Street/Ramius Managed Futures Strategy Fund and Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund) are generally charged at an annual rate of up to   1.50%     of assets under management  . 
                
    Alternative Solutions.   Management fees for the Alternative Solutions business are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of assets under management or notional trading level. Management fees are generally calculated monthly based on assets under management at the end of each month before incentive income or based on assets under management at the beginning of the month.  Management fees earned from the Alternative Solutions business are based and initially calculated on estimated net asset values and actual fees ultimately earned could be impacted to the

extent of any changes in these estimates  .   (For a discussion on sale of our interest in RASL, see Item 2 "Recent Developments")  
             
    Real Estate.   Management fees from the Company's real estate business are generally charged by their general partners at an annual rate from     0.25%   to   1.50%     of total capital commitments during the investment period and of invested capital or net asset value of the applicable fund after the investment period has ended. Management fees are typically paid to the general partners on a quarterly basis, at the beginning of the quarter in arrears, and are prorated for changes in capital commitments throughout the investment period and invested capital after the investment period. The general partners of the funds on the RCG Longview platform are owned jointly by the Company and third parties. Accordingly, the management fees (in addition to incentive income and investment income) generated by these real estate funds are split between the Company and the other general partners.     Pursuant to US GAAP,   these fees and other   income received by the general partners that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are reflected under net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.       
                
    HealthCare Royalty Partners.   During the investment period (as defined in the management agreement of the HealthCare Royalty Partners' funds), management fees for the funds and managed accounts advised by HealthCare Royalty Partners are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of committed capital. After the investment period, management fees are generally charged at an annual rate of up t  o   2%     of the net asset value of the funds or managed accounts or the aggregate cost basis of the unrealized investments held by the funds. Management fees for the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds are calculated on a quarterly basis.   
                
    Ramius Trading Strategies.   Management fees and platform fees for the Company's private commodity trading advisory business are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     0.5%  .    Management and platform fees are generally calculated monthly based on each account's notional trading level at the end of each month  .   
     Incentive income  
  The Company earns incentive income based on net profits (as defined in the respective investment management agreements) with respect to certain of the Company's funds and managed accounts, allocable for each fiscal year that exceeds cumulative unrecovered net losses, if any, that have been carried forward from prior years. For the products we offer, incentive income earned is typically up to     20%   for hedge funds and up to   10%     for alternative solutions products (in certain cases on performance in excess of a benchmark), of the net profits earned for the full year that are attributable to each fee-paying investor. Generally, incentive income on real estate funds is earned after the investor has received a full return of their invested capital, plus a preferred return. However, for certain real estate funds, the Company is entitled to receive incentive fees earlier, provided that the investors have received their preferred return on a current basis or on an investor by investor basis.  These funds are generally subject to a potential clawback of these incentive fees upon the liquidation of the fund if the investor has not received a full return of its invested capital plus the preferred return thereon.  Incentive income in the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds is generally earned only after investors receive a full return of their capital plus a preferred return.     Pursuant to US GAAP,   incentive   income received by the general partners that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are reflected under net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  In periods following a period of a net loss attributable to an investor, the Company generally does not earn incentive income on any future profits attributable to that investor until the accumulated net loss from prior periods is recovered, an arrangement commonly referred to as a  high-water mark.  The Company has elected to record incentive income revenue in accordance with  Method 2  of US GAAP. Under Method 2, the incentive income from the Company's funds and managed accounts for any period is based upon the net profits of those funds and managed accounts at the reporting date. Any incentive income recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations may be subject to future reversal based on subsequent negative performance prior to the conclusion of the fiscal year, when all contingencies have been resolved.      
  Carried interest in the real estate funds is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest actually distributed to date exceeds the amount due to the Company based on cumulative results. As such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest, which is a component of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, represents all amounts previously distributed to the Company, less an assumed tax liability, that would need to be repaid to certain real estate funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. The actual clawback liability does not become realized until the end of a fund's life.

Investment Banking 
              The Company earns investment banking revenue primarily from fees associated with public and private capital raising transactions and providing strategic advisory services. Investment banking revenues are derived primarily from small and mid-capitalization companies within the Company's Target Sectors.        
  Investment banking revenue consists of underwriting fees, strategic/financial advisory fees and placement and sales agent fees.     
             
    Underwriting fees.   The Company earns underwriting fees in securities offerings in which the Company acts as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings, follow-on equity offerings, debt offerings, and convertible security offerings. Fee revenue relating to underwriting commitments is recorded when all significant items relating to the underwriting process have been completed and the amount of the underwriting revenue has been determined. This generally is the point at which all of the following have occurred: (i) the issuer's registration statement has become effective with the SEC or the other offering documents are finalized; (ii) the Company has made a firm commitment for the purchase of securities from the issuer; and (iii) the Company has been informed of the number of securities that it has been allotted.     
     When the Company is not the lead manager for an underwriting transaction, management must estimate the Company's share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the lead manager in order to recognize revenue. Transaction-related expenses are deducted from the underwriting fee and therefore reduce the revenue the Company recognizes as co-manager. Such amounts are adjusted to reflect actual expenses in the period in which the Company receives the final settlement, typically within 90 days following the closing of the transaction.    
             
    Strategic/financial advisory fees.   The Company's strategic advisory revenues include success fees earned in connection with advising companies, principally in mergers and acquisitions and restructuring transactions. The Company also earns fees for related advisory work such as providing fairness opinions. The Company records strategic advisory revenues when the services for the transactions are completed under the terms of each assignment or engagement and collection is reasonably assured. Expenses associated with such transactions are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded.      
                
    Placement and sales agent fees.   The Company earns agency placement fees and sales agent commissions in non-underwritten transactions such as private placements of loans and debt and equity securities, including, private investment in public equity transactions ( PIPEs ), and as sales agent in at-the-market offerings of equity securities.  The Company records placement revenues   (which may be in cash and/or securities)   when the services for the transactions are completed under the terms of each assignment or engagement and collection is reasonably assured.  The Company records sales agent commissions on a trade date basis.  Expenses associated with such transactions are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded.     
     Brokerage 
  Brokerage revenue consists of commissions, principal transactions and equity research fees.    
             
    Commissions.   Commission revenue includes fees from executing client transactions. These fees are recognized on a trade date basis. The Company permits institutional customers to allocate a portion of their commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties. The amounts allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements. Commissions on soft dollar brokerage are recorded net of the related expenditures on an accrual basis.   Commission revenues also includes fees from making algorithms available to clients.     
                
    Principal Transactions.   Principal transactions revenue includes net trading gains and losses from the Company's market-making activities in over-the-counter equity securities, trading of convertible securities, and trading gains and losses on inventory and other firm positions, which include warrants previously received as part of investment banking transactions. In certain cases, the Company provides liquidity to clients by buying or selling blocks of shares of listed stocks without previously identifying the other side of the trade at execution, which subjects the Company to market risk. These positions are typically held for a very short duration.     
                
    Equity and Credit Research Fees.   Equity and credit research fees are paid to the Company for providing equity and credit research. Revenue is recognized once an arrangement exists, access to research has been provided, the fee amount is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

Investment Income 
  Investment income earned by the alternative investment and broker-dealer segments are earned from investing the Company's capital in various strategies an  d from investments in private capital raising transactions of its investment banking clients. 
  Interest and Dividends  
  Interest and dividends are earned by the Company from various sources. The Company receives interest and dividends primarily from investments held by its Consolidated Funds and its brokerage balances from invested capital and securities lending business. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis and interest income is recognized on the debt of those issuers that is deemed collectible. Interest income and expense includes premiums and discounts amortized and accreted on debt investments based on criteria determined by the Company using the effective yield method, which assumes the reinvestment of all interest payments. Dividends are recognized on the ex-dividend date.  
  Reimbursement from Affiliates        
  The Company allocates, at its discretion, certain expenses incurred on behalf of its hedge fund, fund of funds and real estate businesses. These expenses relate to the administration of such subsidiaries and assets that the Company manages for its funds. In addition, pursuant to the funds' offering documents, the Company charges certain allowable expenses to the funds, including charges and personnel costs for legal, compliance, accounting, tax compliance, risk and technology expenses that directly relate to administering the assets of the funds. Such expenses that have been reimbursed at their actual costs are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as employee compensation and benefits, professional, advisory and other fees, communications, occupancy and equipment, client services and business development and other.  
  Lease revenue 
  Lease revenue under operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
  Expenses 
  The Company's expenses consist of compensation and benefits, interest expense and general, administrative and other expenses. 
             
    Compensation and Benefits.    Compensation and benefits is comprised of salaries, benefits, discretionary cash bonuses and equity-based compensation. Annual incentive compensation is variable, and the amount paid is generally based on a combination of employees' performance, their contribution to their business segment, and the Company's performance. Generally, compensation and benefits comprise a significant portion of total expenses, with annual incentive compensation comprising a significant portion of total compensation and benefits expenses. 
                
    Interest and Dividends.    Interest and dividend expense relates primarily to trading activity with respect to the Company's investments and interest expense on debt issued during March and October 2014. 
                
    General, Administrative and Other.    General, administrative and other expenses are primarily related to professional services, occupancy and equipment, business development expenses, communications, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses. These expenses may also include certain one-time charges and non-cash expenses. 
                
    Consolidated Funds Expenses.    Certain funds are consolidated by the Company pursuant to US GAAP. As such, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the expenses of these consolidated entities and the portion attributable to other investors is allocated to a redeemable non-controlling interest. 
     Income Taxes 
  The taxable results of the Company s U.S. operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and city taxation as a corporation. The Company is also subject to foreign taxation on income it generates in certain countries. 
  The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax benefit or expense that will result from differences between the carrying value of its assets for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes, as well as for operating or capital loss and tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance is recorded to bring the net deferred tax assets to a level that, in management s view, is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future. This level will be estimated based on a number of factors, especially the amount of net deferred tax assets of the Company that are actually expected to be realized, for tax purposes, in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities that cannot be realized in a similar future time period and thus that cannot offset the Company s deferred tax assets are not taken into account when calculating the Company s net deferred tax assets.

Redeemable Non-controlling Interests 
  Redeemable non-controlling interests represent the pro rata share of the income or loss of the non-wholly owned consolidated entities attributable to the other owners of such entities. Due to the fact that the non-controlling interests are redeemable at the option of the holder they have been classified as temporary equity. 
   
  Assets Under Management and Fund Performance 
  Assets Under Management 
  Assets under management refer to all of our alternative investment products, solutions and services including   hedge funds, private equity structures, registered investment companies and listed vehicles  . The Company's alternative investment segment includes such strategies as long/short equity, activist equity, event driven equity, event driven credit, global macro, customized portfolio solutions, managed futures, health care royalties and private real estate. 
  Assets under management also include the fair value of assets the Company manages pursuant to separately managed accounts, collateralized debt obligations for which the Company is the collateral manager, and, as indicated in the footnotes to the table below, proprietary assets which the Company has invested in these products. Also, as indicated, assets under management for certain products may represent committed capital or committed funding that may not be under our control but forms part of the alternative investment product s trading level.   
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had assets under management of   $10.5   billion, a   21.0%     decrease   as compared to assets under management of   $13.3   billion as of January 1, 2016. The   $2.8   billion   decrease   in assets under management during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily resulted from the sale of the alternative solutions business (see note (a) to the following table).  
  The following table is a breakout of total assets under management by platform as of   October 1, 2016   (which excludes cross investments from other Ramius platforms):  

(a) 
    The Company owns between 20% and 55% of the general partners or managing members of the real estate business, the activist business, the global macro strategy business (the single strategy hedge funds) and the alternative solutions business (starting as of September 2013).  On September 23, 2016 the Company completed the sale of its interest in the Alternative Solutions business, thereby reducing the Company s estimated assets under management by approximately $2.5 billion.

(d) 
    This amount reflects committed capital. 
              (e) 
    Performance and net returns are net of all management and incentive fees and includes the effect of any foreign exchange translation adjustments and leverage in certain funds. 
              (f) 
    Net returns are calculated on the platform as a whole.  Net return of individual funds will vary based on the timing and strategy the respective funds.  
              (g) 
    The Company s actively marketed hedge fund products have varying liquidity terms typically ranging from daily to quarterly liquidity with less liquidity applying to certain co-investment vehicles.  In 2010, the Company suspended redemption rights with respect to certain hedge funds that are being wound down.  The hedge funds that have suspended redemption rights represent approximately 4.94% of the total hedge fund assets under management. 
              (h) 
    The Ramius Trading Strategies products offer investors daily liquidity. 
              (i) 
    The real estate business does not provide investors with redemption rights.  Investors receive distributions upon dispositions of the underlying real estate investments of which a portion reflects committed capital. 
              (j) 
    The Healthcare Royalty funds do not provide investors with redemption rights.  Investors receive distributions upon realizations of the funds  investments. 
              (k) 
    The collateralized debt obligations managed by the Company is an amortizing pool of assets with cash returned to investors in periodic distributions as it becomes available. 
              (l) 
    Due to the sale of its interest in Orchard Square Partners, effective December 31, 2014, redemptions during the 2014 year include $420.8 million of assets under management related to this business. 
      
  Fund Performance 
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the results of the Company's strategies generally improved relative to their respective benchmarks when compared to the previous three months. 
  Investor sentiment, following a brief negative response to the UK Brexit referendum on June 23, turned positive during the third quarter. This resulted in strong returns for equities, led by US small cap stocks and Emerging Markets.  Eurozone, Japan and other Asian markets also fared well. Investors seem to be looking beyond near-term concerns over sluggish global economic growth. While the Federal Reserve did not raise rates during the third quarter, September Federal Open Market Committee comments suggested such a move might be possible by year-end. While U.S. Treasury 5-10 year notes experienced an increase in yield, corporate debt (both investment grade and high yield) had significant positive returns. Commodity prices, led by agriculture and energy, were lower in the three month period. Volatility across multiple asset classes continued to decline, specifically in respect of currency rates and commodities prices.  The CBOE SPX Volatility Index (VIX) hit new lows during the quarter, and is now down 24% for the year through September.  
  Our activist strategy had positive results for the quarter, but lagged the Russell 2000 Index, which continued to recover from both the risk-off sentiment at the beginning of 2016 and the short-lived drawdown post-Brexit. On a year-to-date basis, the activist strategy has slightly underperformed the Russell 2000 Index, but maintains its long-term outperformance since inception.  The activist strategy s returns will continue to have a meaningful effect on the Company s financial results due to the level of assets under management.  The merger arbitrage strategy rebounded sharply from the second quarter s negative results, outperforming its benchmark index and drawing close to full recovery for the year.  The new Ramius Merger Arbitrage UCITS Fund, in partnership with Bank America Merrill Lynch, began trading in July and also had positive results.  Our options-based global macro strategy had negative performance as the markets continue to evidence an overall decline in implied volatilities as noted above.  Another of our affiliate managers engages in equity long/short investing in consumer-related stocks. Since joining Ramius, the strategy has generated positive results, and that was the case again in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Relative outperformance on both the short and long has allowed the strategy to beat the HFRX Equity Hedge Index thus far in 2016.  Our other equity long/short affiliate (multi-sector) launched during the third quarter for outside investment on October 1, 2016.  The State Street Ramius Managed Futures Strategy Fund, which offers exposure to multi-manager managed futures, had negative returns for the third quarter, but remains positive on a year to date basis. The Company s alternative solutions business, which is based on institutional customized accounts, was sold in September 2016.

The internally managed multi-strategy funds maintained their focus on capital preservation and continued to execute opportunistic transactions linked to certain assets.  
  With regard to the longer-dated investment vehicles in real estate, the largest legacy real estate debt fund, as well as the legacy equity fund were basically unchanged in value for the third quarter. Certain of the legacy real estate funds, including these two, are in the process of returning capital to investors.  The most recent real estate debt vehicle continues to make investments and interim results are meeting performance expectations. Our healthcare royalty strategy, having raised a substantial amount of capital in 2014, remains in its investment period.  As noted last quarter, turbulence in the pharmaceutical and health care sectors continues to present attractive opportunities for longer term investors. As a result, the strategy has been able to put significant money to work in both its latest commingled fund and separately managed accounts. 
   
  Invested Capital 
  The Company invests a significant portion of its capital base to help drive results and facilitate the growth of its alternative investment and broker/dealer businesses. Management allocates capital to three primary investment categories: (i) trading strategies; (ii) merchant banking investments; and (iii) real estate investments. The Company seeks to make strategic and opportunistic investments in varying capital structures across a diverse array of businesses, hedge funds and mutual funds. Much of the Company's trading strategy portfolio is invested along side the Company's alternative investment clients and includes liquid investment strategies such as corporate credit trading, event driven, macro trading, and enhanced cash management. Within its merchant banking investments, management generally takes a long-term view that typically involves investing directly in public and private companies globally, private equity funds and along side its alternative investment clients. In addition, from time to time the Company makes investments in private capital raising transactions of its investment banking clients.  The Company's real estate investment strategy focuses on making investments along side the alternative investment clients invested in the RCG Longview funds, as well as in direct investments in commercial real estate projects. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's invested capital amounted to a net value of   $682.7 million   (supporting a long market value of   $959.6 million  ), representing approximately   89%   of Cowen Group's stockholders' equity presented in accordance with US GAAP. The table below presents the Company's invested equity capital by strategy and as a percentage of Cowen Group's stockholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016  . The net values presented in the table below do not tie to Cowen Group's condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   because they are included in various line items of the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, including  securities owned, at fair value ,  other investments ,  cash and cash equivalents , and  consolidated funds-securities owned, at fair value . 

The allocations shown in the table above will change over time. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  To provide comparative information of the Company's operating results for the periods presented, a discussion of Economic Income (Loss) (which is a non-GAAP measure) of our alternative investment and broker-dealer segments follows the discussion of our total consolidated US GAAP results. Economic Income (Loss) reflects, on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, income earned from the Company's funds and managed accounts and from its own invested capital. Economic Income (Loss) excludes certain adjustments required under US GAAP.

  Revenues 
  Investment Banking 
  Investment banking revenues   decreased     $16.3 million   to   $36.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $53.0 million     in the prior year period  . During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company completed   22 underwriting transactions, five strategic advisory transactions and two debt capital market transaction  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company completed   27 underwriting transactions   and   two strategic advisory transactions  .    The average underwriting fee per transaction was 37.5% less in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year period.     
  Brokerage 
  Brokerage revenues   increased     $8.5 million   to   $49.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $41.1 million   in the prior year period.   This was attributable to the initiation of our prime brokerage businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, the initiation of our credit business in May 2016 and a decrease in facilitation losses in our cash equities business partially offset by lower commissions due to a decrease in customer trading volumes in our cash equity business.  Customer trading volumes across the industry (according to Bloomberg) decreased 10% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Management Fees 
  Management fees   decreased     $0.2 million   to   $10.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $10.5 million   in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in management fees from our alternative solutions business partially offset by higher management fees in our prime services business (acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015) and our macro options business. 
  Incentive Income 
  Incentive income   increased     $1.2 million   to   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with    $0.1 million   in the prior year period.    This increase was primarily related to an increase in performance fees from our multi strategy business. 
  Interest and Dividends 
  Interest and dividends   increased     $0.3 million   to   $3.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $3.6 million   in the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of investments in interest bearing securities during the quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter in 2015. 
  Reimbursements from Affiliates 
  Reimbursements from affiliates   decreased     $1.3 million   to   $2.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $3.4 million   in the prior year period.    The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in reimbursements from the activist business.  
  Aircraft lease revenue

  Segment Analysis and Economic Income (Loss) 
  Segments 
  The Company conducts its operations through two segments: an alternative investment segment and a broker-dealer segment.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's alternative investment segment includes   hedge funds, private equity structures, registered investment companies and listed vehicles   operating results and other investment platforms operating results.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's broker-dealer segment includes   investment banking, research, sales and trading and prime brokerage   businesses' operating results.  
  Economic Income (Loss) 
  The performance measure used by the Company for each segment is Economic Income (Loss), which management uses to evaluate the financial performance of and to make operating decisions for the firm as a whole and each segment. Accordingly, management assesses its business by analyzing the performance of each segment and believes that investors should review the same performance measure that it uses to analyze its segment and business performance. In addition, management believes that Economic Income (Loss) is helpful to gain an understanding of its segment results of operations because it reflects such results on a consistent basis for all periods presented.  
  Our Economic Income (Loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We use Economic Income (Loss) as a measure of each segment's operating performance, not as a measure of liquidity. Economic Income (Loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, operating cash flows, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with US GAAP. As a result of the adjustments made to arrive at Economic Income (Loss), Economic Income (Loss) has limitations in that it does not take into account certain items included or excluded under US GAAP, including our Consolidated Funds. Economic Income (Loss) is considered by management as a supplemental measure to the US GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of each segment's performance as measured by management. For a reconciliation of Economic Income (Loss) to US GAAP net income (loss) for the periods presented and additional information regarding the reconciling adjustments discussed above, see Note   17   to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In general, Economic Income (Loss) is a pre-tax measure that (i) eliminates the impact of consolidation for consolidated funds (ii) excludes goodwill and intangible impairment (iii) excludes certain other acquisition-related adjustments and/or reorganization expenses and (iv) excludes preferred stock dividends.   In addition, Economic Income (Loss) revenues include investment income that represents the income the Company has earned in investing its own capital, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest and dividends, net of associated investment related expenses. For US GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items. Economic Income (Loss) revenues also include management fees, incentive income and investment income earned through the Company's investment as a general partner in certain real estate entities and the Company's investment in the activist business. For US GAAP purposes, all of these items are recorded in other income (loss). In addition, Economic Income (Loss) expenses are reduced by reimbursement from affiliates, which for US GAAP purposes is presented gross as part of revenue.  
  Economic Income (Loss) Revenues 
  The Company's principal sources of Economic Income (Loss) revenues are derived from activities in the following business segments: 
  Our alternative investment segment generates Economic Income (Loss) revenues through three principal sources: management fees, incentive income and investment income from our own capital. Management fees are directly impacted by any increase or decrease in assets under management, while incentive income is impacted by our funds' performance and resulting increase or decrease in assets under management. Investment income from the Company's own capital is impacted by the performance of the funds and other securities in which our capital is invested.  
  Our broker-dealer segment generates Economic Income (Loss) revenues through two principal sources: investment banking and brokerage. The Company earns investment banking revenue primarily from fees associated with public and private capital raising transactions and providing strategic advisory services. Investment banking revenues are derived primarily from small and mid-capitalization companies within the Company's Target Sectors:   healthcare, technology, media and telecommunications, information and technology services, consumer, aerospace and defense, industrials,     and energy and transportation  . The Company's brokerage revenues consist of commissions, principal transactions and fees paid for equity research. Cowen's broker-dealer segment also offers a full-service suite of prime brokerage services. Management reviews brokerage revenue on a combined basis as the vast majority of the revenue is derived from the same group of clients. The Company derives its brokerage revenue primarily from trading equity and equity-linked securities on behalf of institutional investors. The majority of the Company's trading gains and losses are a result of activities that support the facilitation of client orders in both listed and over-the-counter securities, although all trading gains and losses are recorded in brokerage in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
  Economic Income (Loss) Expenses 
  The Company's Economic Income expenses consist of non-interest expenses and interest expense.  Non interest expenses consist of compensation and benefits and non-compensation expenses (fixed and variable), less reimbursement from affiliates. Interest expense is primarily interest from indebtedness, not trading activity (which is included within investment income (loss)).  
  Non-controlling Interests 
  Non-controlling interests represent the pro rata share of the income or loss of the non-wholly owned consolidated entities attributable to the partners of such entities.

This was attributable to the initiation of our prime brokerage businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, the initiation of our credit business in May 2016 and a decrease in facilitation losses in our cash equities business partially offset by lower commissions due to a decrease in customer trading volumes in our cash equity business.

The compensation to revenue ratio was   61%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   67%   for the prior year period.

Management fees for the segment   decreased     $3.3 million   to   $47.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $50.9 million   in the prior year period.  This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in management fees for our alternative solutions and activist businesses offset partially by an increase in management fees from our macro options and equities businesses. 
  Incentive Income (Loss).      Incentive income for the segment   increased     $20.3 million   to   $19.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with a loss of   $1.1 million   in the prior year period.

Investment income for the segment   decreased     $14.7 million   to a loss of   $0.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $14.3 million   in the prior year period.    The decrease primarily relates to a decrease in performance of the Company's own invested capital.

Other income (loss) for the segment   increased     $19.3 million   to   $19.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $0.1 million   in the prior year period.    This increase is primarily related to the sale of our interest in the alternative solutions business and is also related to net underwriting income from our insurance-related business (which was entered into at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015).    
  Broker-Dealer Segment 
  Broker-dealer segment Economic Income (Loss) revenues were   $253.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $50.9 million   compared with Economic Income (Loss) revenues of   $304.7 million   in the prior year.

Brokerage revenues   increased     $41.1 million   to   $153.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $112.3 million     in the prior year period  .   This was attributable to higher commissions due to an increase in customer trading volumes, a decrease in facilitation losses in our cash equities business, the initiation of our prime brokerage businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the initiation of our credit trading business in May 2016.     Customer trading volumes across the industry (according to Bloomberg) increased 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. 
  Investment Income (Loss).      Investment income for the segment   decreased     $4.9 million   to a loss of   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $4.8 million   in the prior year period.  The decrease is a result of a decrease in overall investment income which is allocated amongst the segments. 
  Other Income (Loss).      Other income (loss) for the segment   decreased     $0.5 million   to   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $0.6 million   in the prior year period.

The decrease is due to   $29.4 million   lower revenues during 2016 as compared to 2015 and resulted in a lower compensation and benefits accrual.  The compensation to revenue ratio was   62%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   61%   in the prior year period.

Fixed non-compensation expenses, included within non-interest expenses, increased   $6.5 million   to   $82.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $76.0 million     in the prior year period  .  This increase was primarily due to   higher communications, increased occupancy costs and increased depreciation and amortization all of which are primarily related to acquisitions during late 2015 and during 2016  .

The increase is primarily related to an increase in income allocable to partners due to new partnership agreements entered into during 2015 and early 2016.    Non-Controlling interest represents the portion of the net income or loss attributable to certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries that is allocated to our partners in those subsidiaries.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We continually monitor our liquidity position. The working capital needs of the Company's business have been met through current levels of equity capital, current cash and cash equivalents, and anticipated cash generated from our operating activities, including management fees, incentive income, returns on the Company's own capital, investment banking fees and  
  
   73

brokerage commissions. The Company expects that its primary working capital liquidity needs over the next twelve months will be: 
             
    pay our operating expenses, primarily consisting of compensation and benefits, interest on debt and other general and administrative expenses; and 
                
    provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing business. 
     Based on our historical results, management's experience, our current business strategy and current assets under management, the Company believes that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our cash reserves include cash, cash equivalents and assets readily convertible into cash such as our securities held in inventory. Securities inventories are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $76.9 million   and net liquid investment assets of   $398.1 million  .  Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $7.1 million   and $53.8 million, respectively.    The Company intends to permanently reinvest the capital and accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the respective subsidiary, but remits the current earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to the United States to the extent permissible under local regulatory rules.  The undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries totaled     $1.1 million   and   $1.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   respectively, and the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted to the United States would be approximately     $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
  The timing of cash bonus payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees are generally paid salaries semi-monthly during the year, cash bonus payments, which can make up a significant portion of total compensation, are generally paid once a year by March 15th.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company had unfunded commitments of     $7.4 million     pertaining to capital commitments in     four     real estate investments held by the Company, all of which pertain to related party investments. Such commitments can be called at any time, subject to advance notice. The Company, as a limited partner of the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds and also as a member of HealthCare Royalty Partners General Partners, has committed to invest   $45.8 million     in the Healthcare Royalty Partners funds which are managed by Healthcare Royalty Management.  This commitment is expected to be called over a     two   to     five   year period. The Company will make its pro-rata investment in the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds along with the other limited partners. Through     September 30, 2016  ,   the Company has funded     $37.9 million     towards these commitments.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an unfunded commitment to Eclipse Ventures Fund I, L.P. (formerly Formation8 Partners Hardware Fund I, L.P.) of     $0.9 million  .    The remaining capital commitment is expected to be called over a     one     year period.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company had an unfunded commitment to Lagunita Biosciences, LLC of     $3.5 million  .    The remaining capital commitment is expected to be called over a   three  -  year period.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an unfunded commitment to Eclipse Fund II, L.P. of     $1.0 million  .   The remaining capital commitment is expected to be called over an     eight   year period.   As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an unfunded commitment to Eclipse Continuity Fund I, L.P. o  f   $0.9 million  .    The remaining capital commitment is expected to be called over an     eight   year period. 
  Due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a market-maker and execution agent, the amount of our cash and short-term investments, as well as operating cash flow, may vary considerably due to a number of factors, including the dollar value of our positions as principal, whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities, the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements, among others. Certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing, investing or operating activities. Similarly, due to the nature of our business lines, the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses. 
  Revolver 
  On July 31, 2015, the Company entered into a     $25.0 million     364     day revolving unsecured credit facility with multiple financial institutions primarily for working capital management.  On July 29, 2016, the Company amended its credit facility to, among other things, extend the existing stated maturity thereof from August 3, 2016 to September 29, 2016, reduce the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder from     $25 million   to   $15 million     and make future draws on the revolver during the extension period subject to the sole discretion of the lenders thereunder. In connection with the amendment, the Company repaid all outstanding amounts under the credit facility.  The revolving unsecured credit facility terminated in accordance with its terms on September 29, 2016  .  
  Preferred Stock and Purchase of Capped Call Option 
  On May 19, 2015, the Company completed its offering of     120,750     shares of the Company's     5.625%     Series A cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock ("Series A Convertible Preferred Stock") that provided     $117.2 million     of proceeds, net of underwriting fees and issuance costs of     $3.6 million  .  Each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to  
  
   74

dividends at a rate of     5.625%     per annum     which will be payable, when and if declared by the board of directors of the Company, quarterly, in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year.  The Company may, at its option, pay dividends in cash, common stock or a combination thereof  . 
  Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is non-voting and has a liquidity preference over the Company's Class A common stock and ranks senior to all classes or series of the Company's Class A common stock, but junior to all of the Company's existing and future indebtedness with respect to divided rights and rights upon the Company's involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding down. 
  Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into a number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to the liquidation preference of     $1,000     divided by the conversion rate.  The initial conversion rate is     152.2476      shares     (which equates to     $6.57   per share)     of the Company's Class A common stock for each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. At any time on or after May 20, 2020, the Company may elect to convert all outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of the Company s Class A common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, in each case, based on the then-applicable conversion rate, if the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds   150%     of the then-current conversion price on at least     20     trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of     30     consecutive trading days (including on the last trading day of such period) immediately prior to such election.      At the time of conversion, the conversion rate may be adjusted based on certain events including but not limited to the issuance of cash dividends or Class A common stock as a dividends to the Company's Class A common shareholders or a share split or combination. 
  In connection with the issuance and sale of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company entered into a privately negotiated capped call option transaction (the  Capped Call Option Transaction ) with Nomura Global Financial Products Inc. (the  option counterparty ) for     $15.9 million  .   The Capped Call Option Transaction is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s Class A common stock (if the Company elects to convert to common shares) and/or offset any cash payments that the Company is required to make upon conversion of any Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  The Capped Call Option Transaction has an initial effective strike price of     $6.57   per share, which matches the initial conversion price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and a cap price of     $8.39     per share.  However, to the extent that the market price of Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Option Transaction, exceeds the cap price thereof, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or such cash payments would not be offset.  As the Capped Call Option Transaction is a free standing derivative that is indexed to the Company's own stock price and the Company controls if it is settled in cash or stock it qualifies for equity classification as a reduction to additional paid in capital.  
  The Company may also incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital under certain circumstances to respond to market opportunities and challenges. Current market conditions may make it more difficult or costly to borrow additional funds or raise additional capital.

The debt maturities ranged from February 2017 to May 2021 and interest rates ranged from     4.80%     to     7.25%  . As of September 30, 2016, the remaining balance on the aircraft financing agreements was     $14.8 million  .  Interest expense was     $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   respectively.     
  Revolver 
  On July 31, 2015, the Company entered into a     $25.0 million     364     day revolving unsecured credit facility with multiple financial institutions primarily for working capital management.  On July 29, 2016, the Company amended its credit facility to, among other things, extend the existing stated maturity thereof from August 3, 2016 to September 29, 2016, reduce the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder from     $25 million   to   $15 million     and make future draws on the revolver during the extension period subject to the sole discretion of the lenders thereunder. In connection with the amendment, the Company repaid all outstanding amounts under the credit facility.  The revolving unsecured credit facility terminated in accordance with its terms on September 29, 2016  .    
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  The Company entered into several capital leases for computer equipment during the fourth quarter of 2010 and one in January 2014. These leases amounted to     $7.6 million     and are recorded in fixed assets and as capital lease obligations, which are included in short-term borrowings and other debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, and have lease terms that range from     48   to   60     months and interest rates that range from   0.60%   to   6.03%  .   As of     September 30, 2016  , t  he remaining balance on these capital leases was     $2.0 million  .  Interest expense was   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     and     2015   and   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  
  Letters of Credit 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has the following   nine     irrevocable letters of credit, related to leased office space, for which there is cash collateral pledged, which the Company pays a fee on the stated amount of the letter of credit. The Company also has a letter of credit, in the amount of     $5.5 million  , due March 2017, for which cash is pledged as collateral under a reinsurance agreement.

To the extent any letter of credit is drawn upon, interest will be assessed at the prime commercial lending rate  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   there were no amounts due related to these letters of credit  .  
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following tables summarize the Company's contractual cash obligations as of   September 30, 2016  :   

  Clawback obligations 
  For financial reporting purposes, the general partners of a real estate fund have recorded a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners, due to changes in the unrealized value of the fund's remaining investments and where the fund's general partner has previously received carried interest distributions. 
  The clawback liability, however, is not realized until the end of the fund's life.     The life of the real estate funds with a potential clawback obligation is currently in a winding-up phase whereby the remaining assets of the fund are being liquidated as promptly as possible so as to maximize value, however a final date for liquidation has not been set.    
  The fund is currently winding-down   as of   September 30, 2016   and the clawback obligations were   $6.2 million   (see Note   5   to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements).

Minimum payments for all debt outstanding 
  Annual scheduled maturities of debt and minimum payments for all debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , is as follows:  

(a) 
    Amount necessary to reduce net minimum payments to present value calculated at the Company's implicit rate at inception.  This amount also includes the unamortized discount on the convertible debt.   
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  . However, through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreement, customer activities may expose us to off-balance-sheet credit risk. Pursuant to the clearing agreement, we are required to reimburse our clearing broker, without limit, for any losses incurred due to a counterparty's failure to satisfy its contractual obligations. However, these transactions are collateralized by the underlying security, thereby reducing the associated risk to changes in the market value of the security through the settlement date. 
  Cowen and Company, Cowen Prime and ATM Execution are members of various securities exchanges. Under the standard membership agreement, members are required to guarantee the performance of other members and, accordingly, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the exchange, all other members would be required to meet the shortfall. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable.  Accordingly, no contingent liability is carried in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition for these arrangements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Critical accounting policies are those that require the Company to make significant judgments, estimates or assumptions that affect amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto. The Company bases its judgments, estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable and prudent. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
  The following is a summary of what the Company believes to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates. 
  Consolidation 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, and entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, including the Consolidated Funds, in which the Company has a controlling general partner interest. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s funds are not subject to these consolidation provisions with respect to their investments pursuant to their specialized accounting. 
  The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Consolidated Funds on a gross basis. The management fees and incentive income earned by the Company from the Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation; however, the Company s allocated share of net income from these funds was increased by the amount of this eliminated income. Hence, the consolidation of these funds had no net effect on the Company s net earnings. 
  The Company consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise, including those funds in which the Company either directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. In addition, the Company consolidates all variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.    
  
   79 

Table of Contents   

The Company adopted the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation accounting using the modified retrospective method with an effective adoption date of January 1, 2016. The modified retrospective method did not require the restatement of prior year periods. The adoption of the new accounting pronouncement also resulted in a reclassification of certain entities whic  h were previously considered voting interest entities and are considered variable interest entities  . 
  In accordance with these standards, the Company   presently consolidates     six     funds for which it acts as the general partner and investment manager.   As of September 30, 2016 the Company consolidated the following funds: Ramius Enterprise LP ( Enterprise LP ), Ramius Merger Fund LLC (the "Merger Fund"), Cowen Private Investments LP ("Cowen Private"), Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund ("Archview Feeder Fund"), Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Master Fund ("Archview Master Fund"), (as of May 1, 2016) Caerus Select Fund LP ("Caerus LP") and (as of July 11, 2016) Ramius Merger Arbitrage UCITS Fund ("UCITS Fund") (collectively the "Consolidated Funds").    
  The Company determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting operating entity ("VOE") or a variable interest entity ("VIE") under US GAAP.    
  Voting Operating Entities     VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders at risk have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.    
  Under US GAAP, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a VOE is ownership of a majority voting interest. Accordingly, the Company consolidates all VOEs in which it owns a majority of the entity's voting shares or units.  
  In connection with the adoption, the Company reevaluated all of its investment products for consolidation. As of January 1, 2016, the Company deconsolidated Quadratic Fund LLC ("Quadratic LLC") as the Company did not hold a significant voting interest in the fund. The adoption of the new accounting pronouncement also resulted in a reclassification of certain entities for which the Company was presumed to have control and will now be VIEs.     
  Variable Interest Entities   VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. In accordance with US GAAP, an enterprise must consolidate all VIEs of which it is the primary beneficiary. Under the US GAAP consolidation model for VIEs, an enterprise that (1) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE's economic performance, and (2) has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and thus is required to consolidate it.     
  The Company reconsiders whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing a periodic qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of the VIE that includes a review of, among other things, its capital structure, contractual agreements between the Company and the VIE, the economic interests that create or absorb variability, related party relationships and the design of the VIE.    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company also sponsors various other entities that it has determined to be VIEs. These VIEs are primarily funds and real estate entities for which the Company serves as the general partner, managing member and/or investment manager with decision-making rights.    
  The Company does not consolidate   certain   entities that are VIEs as it has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary in each instance. Fund investors are entitled to all of the economics of these VIEs with the exception of the management fee and incentive income, if any, earned by the Company. The Company's involvement with funds and real estate entities that are unconsolidated VIEs is limited to providing investment management services in exchange for management fees and incentive income. Although the Company may advance amounts and pay certain expenses on behalf of the funds and real estate entities that it considers to be VIEs, it does not provide, nor is it required to provide, any type of substantive financial support to these entities outside of regular investment management services  . 
  Equity Method Investments     For operating entities over which the Company exercises significant influence but which do not meet the requirements for consolidation as outlined above, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The Company's investments in equity method investees are recorded in other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company's share of earnings or losses from equity method investees is included in net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. The difference between the carrying value of the equity method investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment charge when the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.

Table of Contents   

Other     If the Company does not consolidate an entity, apply the equity method of accounting or account for an investment under the cost method, the Company accounts for such entities (primarily, all securities of such entity which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term as trading securities) in accordance with US GAAP, at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in fair value reflected within net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  Retention of Specialized Accounting     The Consolidated Funds and certain other consolidated companies are investment companies and apply specialized industry accounting for investment companies. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for these funds pursuant to US GAAP. The Company reports its investments on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition at their estimated fair value, with unrealized gains (losses) resulting from changes in fair value reflected within net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other transactions.  Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect different accounting policies for investments depending on whether or not they are held through a consolidated investment company. In addition, the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries     apply the specialized industry accounting for brokers and dealers in securities also prescribed under US GAAP. The Company also retains specialized accounting in consolidation.     
  Valuation of investments and derivative contracts 
  US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The     three     levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:     
  Level 1         Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has    
         the ability to access at the measurement date;    
  Level 2            Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including     
         inputs in markets that are not considered to be active; and    
  Level 3          Fair value is determined based on pricing inputs that are unobservable and includes situations where there is little,     
         if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in this     
         category requires significant management judgment or estimation.    
  Inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may include price information, volatility statistics, specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics, and other factors. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes  observable  requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company considers observable data to be that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the Company's perceived risk of that instrument.    For additional information regarding the use of unobservable inputs to fair value assets and liabilities see Note   6   in the accompanying condensed Consolidated Financial Statement in Part 1 Item 1.  
  The Company and its operating subsidiaries act as the manager for the Consolidated Funds. Both the Company and the Consolidated Funds hold certain investments which are valued by the Company, acting as the investment manager. The fair value of these investments is generally estimated based on proprietary models developed by the Company, which include discounted cash flow analysis, public market comparables, and other techniques and may be based, at least in part, on independently sourced market information. The material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows, the appropriateness of discount rates used, and, in some cases, the ability to execute, timing of, and estimated proceeds from expected financings. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the selection of an appropriate valuation methodology as well as the assumptions used in these models, and the timing and actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values derived based on the use of those estimates. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of the Company's investments and the investments held by the Consolidated Funds in the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Company's investments are relatively illiquid or thinly traded and may not be immediately liquidated on demand if needed. Fair values assigned to these investments may differ significantly from the fair values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and such differences could be material  . 
  The Company primarily uses the  market approach  to value its financial instruments measured at fair value. In determining an instrument's level within the hierarchy, the Company categorizes the Company's financial instruments into     three    
  
   81 

Table of Contents   

categories: securities, derivative contracts and other investments. To the extent applicable, each of these categories can further be divided between those held long or sold short.      
  The Company has the option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The election is made on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.  The Company has elected the fair value option for certain of its investments held by its operating companies.  This option has been elected because the Company believes that it is consistent with the manner in which the business is managed as well as the way that financial instruments in other parts of the business are recorded. 
  Securities      Securities with values based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  These securities include active listed equities, certain U.S. government and sovereign obligations, ETF's, mutual funds and certain money market securities. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.    
  Certain positions for which trading activity may not be readily visible, consisting primarily of convertible debt, corporate debt and loans and restricted equities, are stated at fair value and classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair values assigned by management are determined in good faith and are based on available information considering, trading activity, broker quotes, quotations provided by published pricing services, counterparties and other market participants, and pricing models using quoted inputs, and do not necessarily represent the amounts which might ultimately be realized. As level 2 investments include positions that are not always traded in active markets and/or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability. 
  Derivative contracts     Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or privately negotiated over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures contracts and exchange-traded option contracts, are typically classified within level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether or not they are deemed to be actively traded. OTC derivatives, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, have inputs which can generally be corroborated by market data and are therefore classified within level 2.   OTC derivatives, such as swaps and options where market data is not readily available or observable are classified as level 3. 
  Other investments     Other investments consist primarily of portfolio funds, real estate investments and equity method investments, which are valued as follows  : 
           i.  
    Portfolio funds     Portfolio funds ( Portfolio Funds ) include interests in funds and investment companies which may be managed by the Company or its affiliates. The Company follows US GAAP regarding fair value measurements and disclosures relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value ( NAV ) per share (or its equivalent). The guidance permits, as a practical expedient, an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies as defined by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment.     In accordance with US GAAP, investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
              ii.  
    Real estate investments     Real estate debt and equity investments are valued at fair value. The fair value of real estate investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. Real estate investments without a public market are valued based on assumptions and valuation techniques used by the Company. Such valuation techniques may include discounted cash flow analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates or earnings multiples applied to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, the Company considers several valuation techniques when measuring the fair value of a real estate investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate. Real estate investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Company for significant changes at the property level or a significant change in the overall market which would impact the value of the real estate investment resulting in unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
     Real estate and capital markets are cyclical in nature. Property and investment values are affected by, among other things, the availability of capital, occupancy rates, rental rates and interest and inflation rates. In addition, the Company invests in real estate and real estate related investments for which no liquid market exists. The market prices for such investments may be volatile and may not be readily ascertainable. Amounts ultimately realized by the Company from investments sold may differ from the fair values presented, and the differences could be material.

Table of Contents   

The Company's real estate investments are typically categorized as level 3 investments within the fair value hierarchy as management uses significant unobservable inputs in determining their estimated fair value.    
  Revenue recognition 
  The Company's principal sources of revenue are derived from two segments: an alternative investment segment and a broker-dealer segment, as more fully described below.   
  Our alternative investment segment generates revenue through three principal sources: management fees, incentive income and investment income from the Company's own capital. 
  Our broker-dealer segment generates revenue through three principal sources: investment banking, brokerage and investment income.  
  Management fees  
  The Company earns management fees from affiliated funds and certain managed accounts that it serves as the investment manager based on assets under management. The actual management fees received vary depending on distribution fees or fee splits paid to third parties either in connection with raising the assets or structuring the investment. Management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis at the beginning of each quarter in arrears and are prorated for capital inflows and redemptions. While some investors may have separately negotiated fees, in general the management fees are as follows: 
             
    Hedge Funds  .    Management fees for the Company's hedge funds are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of assets under management or notional trading level. Management fees are generally calculated monthly based on assets under management at the end of each month before incentive income  .   
                
    Registered Funds.      Management fees for the Company s registered funds (State Street/Ramius Managed Futures Strategy Fund and Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund) are generally charged at an annual rate of up to   1.50%     of assets under management  .  
                
    Alternative Solutions.   Management fees for the Alternative Solutions business are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of assets under management or notional trading level. Management fees are generally calculated monthly based on assets under management at the end of each month before incentive income or based on assets under management at the beginning of the month.  Management fees earned from the Alternative Solutions business are based and initially calculated on estimated net asset values and actual fees ultimately earned could be impacted to the extent of any changes in these estimates  .     
                
    Real Estate.   Management fees from the Company's real estate business are generally charged by their general partners at an annual rate from     0.25%   to   1.50%     of total capital commitments during the investment period and of invested capital or net asset value of the applicable fund after the investment period has ended. Management fees are typically paid to the general partners on a quarterly basis, at the beginning of the quarter in arrears, and are prorated for changes in capital commitments throughout the investment period and invested capital after the investment period. The general partners of the funds on the RCG Longview platform are owned jointly by the Company and third parties. Accordingly, the management fees (in addition to incentive income and investment income) generated by these real estate funds are split between the Company and the other general partners.     Pursuant to US GAAP,   these fees and other   income received by the general partners that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are reflected under net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.       
                
    HealthCare Royalty Partners.      During the investment period (as defined in the management agreement of the HealthCare Royalty Partners' funds), management fees for the funds and managed accounts advised by HealthCare Royalty Partners are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     2%     of committed capital. After the investment period, management fees are generally charged at an annual rate of up t  o   2%     of the net asset value of the funds or managed accounts or the aggregate cost basis of the unrealized investments held by the funds. Management fees for the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds are calculated on a quarterly basis.   
                
    Ramius Trading Strategies.   Management fees and platform fees for the Company's private commodity trading advisory business are generally charged at an annual rate of up to     0.5%  .    Management and platform fees are generally calculated monthly based on each account's notional trading level at the end of each month  .   
     Incentive income  
  The Company earns incentive income based on net profits (as defined in the respective investment management agreements) with respect to certain of the Company's funds and managed accounts, allocable for each fiscal year that exceeds  
  
   83 

Table of Contents   

cumulative unrecovered net losses, if any, that have been carried forward from prior years. For the products we offer, incentive income earned is typically up to     20%   for hedge funds and up to   10%     for alternative solutions products (in certain cases on performance in excess of a benchmark), of the net profits earned for the full year that are attributable to each fee-paying investor. Generally, incentive income on real estate funds is earned after the investor has received a full return of their invested capital, plus a preferred return. However, for certain real estate funds, the Company is entitled to receive incentive fees earlier, provided that the investors have received their preferred return on a current basis or on an investor by investor basis.  These funds are generally subject to a potential clawback of these incentive fees upon the liquidation of the fund if the investor has not received a full return of its invested capital plus the preferred return thereon.  Incentive income in the HealthCare Royalty Partners funds is generally earned only after investors receive a full return of their capital plus a preferred return.     Pursuant to US GAAP,   incentive   income received by the general partners that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are reflected under net gains (losses) on securities, derivatives and other investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    
  In periods following a period of a net loss attributable to an investor, the Company generally does not earn incentive income on any future profits attributable to that investor until the accumulated net loss from prior periods is recovered, an arrangement commonly referred to as a  high-water mark.  The Company has elected to record incentive income revenue in accordance with  Method 2  of US GAAP. Under Method 2, the incentive income from the Company's funds and managed accounts for any period is based upon the net profits of those funds and managed accounts at the reporting date. Any incentive income recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations may be subject to future reversal based on subsequent negative performance prior to the conclusion of the fiscal year, when all contingencies have been resolved.      
  Carried interest in the real estate funds is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest actually distributed to date exceeds the amount due to the Company based on cumulative results. As such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest, which is a component of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, represents all amounts previously distributed to the Company, less an assumed tax liability, that would need to be repaid to certain real estate funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. The actual clawback liability does not become realized until the end of a fund's life.  
  Investment Banking  
  The Company earns investment banking revenue primarily from fees associated with public and private capital raising transactions and providing strategic advisory services. Investment banking revenues are derived primarily from small and mid-capitalization companies within the Company's Target Sectors.     
  Investment banking revenue consists of underwriting fees, strategic/financial advisory fees and placement and sales agent fees.   
             
    Underwriting fees.   The Company earns underwriting fees in securities offerings in which the Company acts as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings, follow-on equity offerings, debt offerings, and convertible security offerings. Fee revenue relating to underwriting commitments is recorded when all significant items relating to the underwriting process have been completed and the amount of the underwriting revenue has been determined. This generally is the point at which all of the following have occurred: (i) the issuer's registration statement has become effective with the SEC or the other offering documents are finalized; (ii) the Company has made a firm commitment for the purchase of securities from the issuer; and (iii) the Company has been informed of the number of securities that it has been allotted.     
     When the Company is not the lead manager for an underwriting transaction, management must estimate the Company's share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the lead manager in order to recognize revenue. Transaction-related expenses are deducted from the underwriting fee and therefore reduce the revenue the Company recognizes as co-manager. Such amounts are adjusted to reflect actual expenses in the period in which the Company receives the final settlement, typically within 90 days following the closing of the transaction.    
             
    Strategic/financial advisory fees.   The Company's strategic advisory revenues include success fees earned in connection with advising companies, principally in mergers and acquisitions and restructuring transactions. The Company also earns fees for related advisory work such as providing fairness opinions. The Company records strategic advisory revenues when the services for the transactions are completed under the terms of each assignment or engagement and collection is reasonably assured. Expenses associated with such transactions are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded.      
                
    Placement and sales agent fees.   The Company earns agency placement fees and sales agent commissions in non-underwritten transactions such as private placements of loans and debt and equity securities, including, private investment in public equity transactions ( PIPEs ), and as sales agent in at-the-market offerings of equity securities.

  Brokerage revenue consists of commissions, principal transactions and equity research fees.    
             
    Commissions.   Commission revenue includes fees from executing client transactions. These fees are recognized on a trade date basis. The Company permits institutional customers to allocate a portion of their commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties. The amounts allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements. Commissions on soft dollar brokerage are recorded net of the related expenditures on an accrual basis.     
                
    Principal Transactions.   Principal transactions revenue includes net trading gains and losses from the Company's market-making activities in over-the-counter equity securities, trading of convertible securities, and trading gains and losses on inventory and other firm positions, which include warrants previously received as part of investment banking transactions. In certain cases, the Company provides liquidity to clients by buying or selling blocks of shares of listed stocks without previously identifying the other side of the trade at execution, which subjects the Company to market risk. These positions are typically held for a very short duration.     
                
    Equity Research Fees.   Equity and credit research fees are paid to the Company for providing equity and credit research. Revenue is recognized once an arrangement exists, access to research has been provided, the fee amount is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.    
     Investment Income 
  Investment income earned by the alternative investment and broker-dealer segments are earned from investing the Company's capital in various strategies an  d from investments in private capital raising transactions of its investment banking clients. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identifiable with the reporting unit. As a result, all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit. 
  In accordance with US GAAP, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at an interim period if events or changed circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under US GAAP, the Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform the two-step approach.    The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the related goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication that the related goodwill might be impaired and the step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.  
  The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Goodwill impairment tests involve significant judgment in determining the estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, economic forecast and other assumptions which are then used in acceptable valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earning and or transactions multiples) and / or income approach (discounted cash flow method). Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and any resulting impairment of goodwill.  
  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated average useful lives. The Company does not have any intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. An impairment

Table of Contents   

loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations if the sum of the estimated discounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. 
  Legal Reserves 
  The Company estimates potential losses that may arise out of legal and regulatory proceedings and records a reserve and takes a charge to income when losses with respect to such matters are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with US GAAP.  These amounts are reported in other expenses, net of recoveries, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note   12   "Commitments and Contingencies" in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016   for further discussion.

  Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. For a more detailed discussion concerning our market risk, see Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide a reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings       
  In the ordinary course of business, we   are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of securities, banking, anti-fraud, anti-money laundering, employment and other statutory and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief.    
  In the ordinary course of business, we   are also subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information gathering requests (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Certain   of our affiliates and subsidiaries   are investment banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, investment advisers or other regulated entities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S., state and foreign securities, commodity futures and other regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators,   we receive requests, and orders seeking documents and other information in connection with various aspects of our regulated activities.  
  Due to the global scope of our operations, and presence in countries around the world, we   may be subject to litigation, and governmental and regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially, and present substantially different risks, from those   we are subject to in the United States.

The Company seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter.    
  In accordance with US GAAP, the Company establishes reserves for contingencies when the Company believes that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses a contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred and there is no reserve for the loss because the conditions above are not met. The Company's disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters, for which an estimate can be made.  Neither a reserve nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote  .        
  The Company appropriately reserves for certain matters where, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of liability is probable and the extent of such liability is reasonably estimable. Such amounts are included within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the     accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and currently available information and involve a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the type and nature of the litigation, claim or proceeding, the progress of the matter, the advice of legal counsel, the Company's defenses and its experience in similar cases or proceedings as well as its assessment of matters, including settlements, involving other defendants in similar or related cases or proceedings. The Company may increase or decrease its legal reserves in the future, on a matter-by-matter basis, to account for developments in such matters.  The Company accrues legal fees as incurred.    
  The following information reflects developments with respect to the Company's legal proceedings that occurred in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
  On May 28, 2014, Energy Intelligence Group, Inc. and Energy Intelligence Group UK (collectively, "EIG") filed a lawsuit against Cowen and Company, LLC in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York (Energy Intelligence Group, Inc. and Energy Intelligence Group UK v. Cowen and Company, LLC, No. 14-CV-3789). The complaint alleges copyright infringement based on alleged impermissible distribution of EIG's publication, Oil Daily, by Cowen and Company and Dahlman Rose   Company, LLC, as Cowen's alleged predecessor-in-interest. EIG is seeking statutory damages based on alleged willful infringement of their copyrights. On November 12, 2014, the Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the EIG complaint.  On September 25, 2015, the Company filed its motion for partial summary judgment to dismiss certain of EIG s claims relating to Dahlman Rose s alleged copyright infringement.  During the second quarter the Company also filed a motion to disqualify EIG s copyright counsel based on a conflict of interest.  Both of the Company s motions were heard in the second quarter of 2016.  On July 15, 2016 the District Court ruled in favor of the Company on both of its motions.  The Company and EIG entered into a settlement agreement on September 30, 2016, pursuant to which EIG agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice.  The settlement amount paid by the Company and the current period impact of the settlement was not material to the Company s financial position or the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The dismissal of the lawsuit was approved by the District Court on October 4, 2016.    
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These risk factors describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.
