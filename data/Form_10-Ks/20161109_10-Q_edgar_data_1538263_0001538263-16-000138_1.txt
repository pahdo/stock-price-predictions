    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     The consolidated financial statements presented in this report include the accounts of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("HomeTrust"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, HomeTrust Bank (the "Bank"). As used throughout this report, the term the "Company" refers to HomeTrust and the Bank, its consolidated subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires. Effective December 31, 2015, the Bank converted from a national association to a North Carolina state bank. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations "Overview" for discussion of charter change. 
   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. It is recommended that these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   ("  2016   Form 10-K") filed with the SEC on September 13,   2016  . The results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  .  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements. These policies relate to (i) the determination of the provision and the allowance for loan losses, (ii) business combinations and acquired loans, (iii) the valuation of REO, (iv) the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, and (v) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These policies and judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Critical Accounting Policies) in our   2016   Form 10-K. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Further, subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and the Company's financial condition and operating results in future periods.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which defers the effective date of Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09 one year. ASU No. 2014-09 created Topic 606 and supersedes Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In general, the new guidance requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients, but does not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. ASU No. 2015-14 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. For financial reporting purposes, the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10) Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The ASU amends the guidance in GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU includes the following changes: i) equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) requires the use of exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; (iv) allows an equity investment that does not have readily determinable fair values, to be measured at cost minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer; (v) eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, and requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair

value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (vii) clarifies that a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities should be evaluated in combination with the organization s other deferred tax assets. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (ASC 842)." The guidance in this ASU requires most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to avoid misstating the lessee s balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." The ASU changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The ASU significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The ASU amends the guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and is intended to reduce the diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all entities beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Business Combinations 
     On September 21, 2016, the Company announced that HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and TriSummit Bancorp, Inc. ("TriSummit") entered into an agreement under which the Company will acquire TriSummit with   six   locations in Kingsport, TN, Johnson City, TN, and Bristol, VA (the  Tri-Cities  region) and also in Morristown and Jefferson City, TN. The acquisition will add approximately   $246.0 million   of loans and   $288.0 million   of deposits. Under the terms of the agreement, TriSummit shareholders will receive a total of   $8.80   per share in merger consideration consisting of   $4.40   in cash plus   $4.40   in HomeTrust common stock. This represents approximately   $31.8 million   of aggregate transaction consideration. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first calendar quarter of 2017, subject to TriSummit shareholder approval and customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

    Securities Available for Sale 
     Securities available for sale consist of the following at the dates indicated:

    HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Debt securities available for sale by contractual maturity at the dates indicated are shown below. Mortgage-backed securities are not included in the maturity categories because the borrowers in the underlying pools may prepay without penalty; therefore, it is unlikely that the securities will pay at their stated maturity schedule. 

The Company had no sales of securities available for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  Securities available for sale with costs totaling   $134,678   and   $151,359   with market values of   $137,064   and   $154,132   at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure various public deposits and other borrowings. 
  The gross unrealized losses and the fair value for securities available for sale aggregated by the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were as follows:   

The total number of securities with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016  , and   June 30, 2016   were   53   and   44  , respectively. Unrealized losses on securities have not been recognized in income because management has the intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future,

and has determined that it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities prior to a recovery in value. The decline in fair value was largely due to increases in market interest rates. The Company had   no   other than temporary impairment losses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
  As a requirement for membership, the Bank invests in stock of the FHLB of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ("FRB"). No ready market exists for this stock and the carrying value approximates its fair value based on the redemption provisions of the FHLB of Atlanta and the FRB. 
   
   Loans consist of the following at the dates indicated: 

All the qualifying one-to-four family first mortgage loans, HELOCs, and FHLB Stock are pledged as collateral by a blanket pledge to secure any outstanding FHLB advances.

The Company's recorded investment in loans, by segment and class, that are not accruing interest or are   90   days or more past due and still accruing interest at the dates indicated follow: 

PCI loans totaling   $6,149   at   September 30, 2016   and   $6,607   at   June 30, 2016   are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. 
  Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are loans which have renegotiated loan terms to assist borrowers who are unable to meet the original terms of their loans.  Such modifications to loan terms may include a lower interest rate, a reduction in principal, or a longer term to maturity. Additionally, all TDRs are considered impaired. The Company had no commitments to lend additional funds on these TDR loans at September 30, 2016. 
  The Company's loans that were performing under the payment terms of TDRs that were excluded from nonaccruing loans above at the dates indicated follow: 

An analysis of the allowance for loan losses by segment for the periods shown is as follows:

The Company's ending balances of loans and the related allowance, by segment and class, at the dates indicated follows: 

Loans acquired from acquisitions are initially excluded from the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company records these loans at fair value, which includes a credit discount, therefore, no allowance for loan losses are established for these acquired loans at acquisition. A provision for loan losses is recorded for any further deterioration in these acquired loans subsequent to the acquisition.

The Company's impaired loans and the related allowance, by segment and class, at the dates indicated follows: 

Impaired loans above excludes   $0   at   September 30, 2016   and   $2,541   at   June 30, 2016   in PCI loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. 
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, impaired loans with a recorded allowance increased primarily due to the change in methodology of measuring impairment for $5.2 million of loans from the collateral method to the present value of future cash flows method to better reflect the anticipated repayments of these loans.  
  The table above includes   $21,962   and   $19,762  , of impaired loans that were not individually evaluated at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, because these loans did not meet the Company's threshold for individual impairment evaluation. The recorded allowance above includes   $604   and   $164   related to these loans that were not individually evaluated at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively.

For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the following table presents a breakdown of the types of concessions made on TDRs by loan class:                                       

The following table presents loans that were modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Other TDRs include TDRs that have a below market interest rate and extended payment terms. The Company does not typically forgive principal when restructuring troubled debt.

    HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

In the determination of the allowance for loan losses, management considers TDRs for all loan classes, and the subsequent nonperformance in accordance with their modified terms, by measuring impairment based on either the value of the loan's expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or on the collateral value, net of the estimated costs of disposal, if the loan is collateral dependent. 
   
           6. 
    Real Estate Owned 
     The activity within REO for the periods shown is as follows:   

  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Bank had $  961   and $  824   respectively, of foreclosed residential real estate property in REO. The recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure totaled $  2,112   and $  1,681   for September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.

    Net Income per Share 
     Per the provisions of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. ESOP shares are considered outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share when the shares are committed to be released. 
  Net income is allocated between the common stock and participating securities pursuant to the two-class method, based on their rights to receive dividends, participate in earnings, or absorb losses.  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding participating nonvested restricted shares. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted net income per share of common stock: 

There were   46,500   and   40,000   outstanding stock options that were anti-dilutive for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
           8. 
    Equity Incentive Plan 
     The Company provides stock-based awards through the   2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan  , which   provides for awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights and cash awards to directors, emeritus directors, officers, employees and advisory directors  . The cost of equity-based awards under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the plan is   2,962,400  , including   2,116,000   for stock options and stock appreciation rights and   846,400   for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
  Shares of common stock issued under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or repurchased shares. During fiscal 2013, the Company had repurchased the   846,400   shares available for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan on the open market, for   $13,297  , at an average cost of   $15.71   per share.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Loan Commitments     Legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, loan commitments (excluding   $122,710   and   $125,157   of undisbursed portions of construction loans) totaled   $41,129   and   $39,609   of which   $9,144   and   $9,932   were variable rate commitments and   $31,985   and   $29,677   were fixed rate commitments. The fixed rate loans had interest rates ranging from   2.20%   to   5.75%   at   September 30, 2016   and   2.02%   to   7.99%   at   June 30, 2016  , and terms ranging from   three   to   30   years. Pre-approved but unused lines of credit (principally second mortgage home equity loans and overdraft protection loans) totaled   $339,185   and   $340,397   at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively. These amounts represent the Company's exposure to credit risk, and in the opinion of management have no more than the normal lending risk that the Company commits to its borrowers. The Company has two types of commitments related to loans held for sale: rate lock commitments and forward loan commitments. Rate lock commitments are commitments to extend credit to a customer that has an interest rate lock and are considered derivative instruments. The rate lock commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting. In order to mitigate the risk from interest rate fluctuations, we enter into forward loan sale commitments on a  best efforts  basis, which do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument. The fair value of these commitments was not material at   September 30, 2016   or   June 30, 2016  . 
  The Company grants construction and permanent loans collateralized primarily by residential and commercial real estate to customers throughout its primary market area. In addition, the Company grants municipal leases to customers throughout North and South Carolina. The Company's loan portfolio can be affected by the general economic conditions within these market areas.  Management believes that the Company has no concentration of credit in the loan portfolio. 
  Restrictions on Cash     The Bank is required by regulation to maintain a varying cash reserve balance with the Federal Reserve System. The daily average calculated cash reserve required as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   was   $2,413  , and   $2,346  , respectively, which was satisfied by vault cash and balances held at the FRB. 
  Guarantees     Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable and payment is only guaranteed upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary. Total commitments under standby letters of credit as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were   $2,139   and   $2,326  , respectively. There was no liability recorded for these letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   or   June 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Litigation         The Company is involved in several litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. These claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to actions to enforce liens on properties in which the Company holds a security interest. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations  .

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
  The Company groups assets at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 
           Level 1: 
    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 
              Level 2: 
    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
              Level 3: 
    Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 
     Following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value. The Company does not have any liabilities recorded at fair value. 
  Investment Securities Available for Sale 
  Securities available for sale are valued on a recurring basis at quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices of comparable securities. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities and debentures issued by government sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, and corporate debt securities. Level 3 securities include one community bank corporate bond that is thinly traded. The community bank corporate bond was acquired as part of a bank acquisition and is carried at book value, which approximates fair value. Because the bond is thinly traded we rely on public information to review the overall financial condition and capital level of the community bank.   
  Loans 
  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. From time to time, however, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, the fair value is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. The Company reviews all impaired loans each quarter to determine if an allowance is necessary. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. 
  The fair value of impaired loans is estimated in one of two ways, which include collateral value and discounted cash flows. Loans are considered collateral dependent if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. For these collateral dependent impaired loans, the Company obtains updated appraisals at least annually. These appraisals are reviewed for appropriateness and then discounted for estimated closing costs to determine if an allowance is necessary. As part of the quarterly review of impaired loans, the Company reviews these appraisals to determine if any additional discounts to the fair value are necessary. If a current appraisal is not obtained, the Company determines whether a discount is needed to the value from the original appraisal based on the decline in value of similar properties with recent appraisals. For loans that are not collateral dependent, estimated fair value is based on the present value of expected future cash flows using the interest rate implicit in the original agreement. Impaired loans where a charge-off has occurred or an allowance is established during the period being reported require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The Company records such impaired loans as a nonrecurring Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  
  Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale are adjusted to lower of cost or fair value.  Fair value is based upon investor pricing. The Company considers all loans held for sale carried at fair value as nonrecurring Level 3. 
  Real Estate Owned 
  REO is considered held for sale and is adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loan to foreclosed assets.  Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised value of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. The Company considers all REO that has been charged off or received an allowance during the period as nonrecurring Level 3.

The stated carrying value and estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , are summarized below: 

The Company had off-balance sheet financial commitments, which include approximately   $503,024   and   $505,163   of commitments to originate loans, undisbursed portions of interim construction loans, and unused lines of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively (see Note 9). Since these commitments are based on current rates, the carrying amount approximates the fair value. 
  Estimated fair values were determined using the following methods and assumptions: 
  Cash and interest-bearing deposits     The stated amounts approximate fair values as maturities are less than 90 days. 
  Commercial paper   - The stated amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. 
  Certificates of deposit in other banks     The stated amounts approximate fair values. 
  Securities available for sale     Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. The Company has one $1.0 million community bank corporate bond that is not actively traded and considered a level three asset.

Loans held for sale     The fair value of loans held for sale is determined by outstanding commitments from investors on a "best efforts" basis or current investor yield requirements, calculated on the aggregate loan basis. 
  Loans, net     Fair values for loans are estimated by segregating the portfolio by type of loan and discounting scheduled cash flows using current market interest rates for loans with similar terms and credit quality.  A prepayment assumption is used as an estimate of the portion of loans that will be repaid prior to their scheduled maturity.  Both the carrying value and estimated fair value amounts are shown net of the allowance for loan losses and purchase discounts. 
  FHLB and FRB stock    No ready market exists for these stocks and they have no quoted market value. However, redemptions of these securities have historically been at par value. Accordingly, cost is deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
  Deposits         Fair values for demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings accounts are the amounts payable on demand as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows using current market interest rates for accounts with similar maturities. 
  Borrowings     The fair value of advances from the FHLB is estimated based on current rates for borrowings with similar terms. 
  Accrued interest receivable and payable     The stated amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate the fair value. 
  Limitations     Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
  Fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, a significant asset not considered a financial asset is premises and equipment. In addition, tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

  As used throughout this report, the terms "we", "our", "us", "HomeTrust Bancshares" or the "Company" refer to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including HomeTrust Bank (the "Bank") unless the context indicates otherwise. 
   
  Overview 
  HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was organized in July 2012 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of HomeTrust Bank, upon the Bank's conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank ("Conversion"). The Conversion was completed on July 10, 2012. On August 25, 2014, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank charter to a national bank charter and the Company became a bank holding company. On December 31, 2015, the Bank converted from a national association to a North Carolina state bank. As a national bank, the Bank's primary regulator was the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). As a North Carolina state-chartered bank, and member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank's primary regulators are the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Bank's deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). 
  
   26 

HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. In connection with the recent charter change, the Company elected to be treated as a financial holding company, which allows it flexibility to engage in some non-bank activities that are financial in nature. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiary. 
  Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds in loans secured primarily by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences, including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, indirect automobile loans, and municipal leases. Municipal leases are secured primarily by a ground lease for a firehouse or an equipment lease for fire trucks and firefighting equipment to fire departments located throughout North and South Carolina. We also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, as well as, certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC. 
  We offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. 
  We are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as, government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. 
  Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking income and gains and losses from sales of securities. 
  An offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses which is required to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income. 
  Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, expenses for occupancy, marketing and computer services, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities. 
  In recent years, we have expanded our geographic footprint into five additional markets through strategic acquisitions as well as two de novo commercial loan offices. Looking forward, we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.  
  On September 21, 2016, the Company announced that HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and TriSummit entered into an agreement under which the Company will acquire TriSummit with six locations in Kingsport, TN, Johnson City, TN, and Bristol, VA (the  Tri-Cities  region) and also in Morristown and Jefferson City, TN. The acquisition will add approximately $246.0 million of loans and $288.0 million of deposits. The Company expects the acquisition to close during the first calendar quarter of 2017, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had 39 locations in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, the "Piedmont" region, Charlotte, and a loan production office in Raleigh), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley).  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. These policies relate to (i) the determination of the provision and the allowance for loan losses, (ii) business combinations and acquired loans, (iii) the valuation of REO, (iv) the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, and (v) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These policies and estimates are described in further detail in Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies with the 2016 Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the disclosure contained in the Company's   2016   Form 10-K. 
  On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an "emerging growth company" we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting

pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, although we have not done so to date. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards or disclosures. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.   Refer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include: tangible book value per share; tangible equity to tangible assets ratio; net interest income and net interest margin as adjusted to exclude additional FHLB borrowings and proceeds from such borrowings; net income, earnings per share ("EPS"), return on assets ("ROA"), and return on equity ("ROE") excluding merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, and gain from the sale of premises and equipment; and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans excluding acquired loans. Management elected to obtain additional FHLB borrowings beginning November 2014 as part of a plan to increase net interest income. The Company believes that showing the effects of the additional borrowings on net interest income and net interest margins is useful to both management and investors as these measures are commonly used to measure financial institutions performance and against peers.  
    
  Management has presented the non-GAAP financial measures in this discussion and analysis excluding merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, and gain from the sale of premises because it believes excluding these items is more indicative of and provides useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations while facilitating comparison of the quality and composition of the Company s earnings over time and in comparison to its competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, are not audited and are not a substitute for operating results or any analysis determined in accordance with GAAP. Where applicable, we have also presented comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies. See  Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  for more detailed information about our financial performance. 
  Set forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of tangible book value and tangible book value per share:

Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016    
  General.    Total assets at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were   $2.8 billion   and $2.7 billion, respectively. Total liabilities at both   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were $2.4 billion. The increase in borrowings of $45.5 million, or 9.3% and the cumulative decrease of $16.2 million, or 2.5%, in cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, certificates of deposit in other banks, and securities available for sale for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were redeployed to fund higher yielding loans and reduce higher cost certificates of deposit. We continue to utilize our leveraging strategy, where additional short-term FHLB borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income, as well as increased dividend income from the required purchase of additional FHLB stock. 
  Cash, cash equivalents, and commercial paper.    Total cash and cash equivalents   increased     $8.0 million  , or   15.1%  , to   $60.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $52.6 million   at   June 30, 2016  . In conjunction with our leveraging strategy, we purchase commercial paper to take advantage of higher returns with relatively low risk while remaining highly liquid. The commercial paper balance at September 30, 2016   decreased     $9.2 million  , or   4.0%   to   $220.7 million   from $229.9 million at June 30, 2016. 
  Investments.    Securities available for sale   decreased     $7.0 million  , or   3.5%  , to   $193.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $200.7 million   at   June 30, 2016  . During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , $13.0 million of securities available for sale were purchased, $12.6 million matured, and $6.6 million of principal payments were received. The securities purchased during this period were primarily short- to intermediate-term U.S. government agency notes. At   September 30, 2016  , certificates of deposits in other banks totaled   $153.4 million   compared to   $161.5 million   at   June 30, 2016  . All certificates of deposit in other banks are fully insured by the FDIC. Other investments at cost include FRB and FHLB stock totaling $6.2 million and $25.3 million at   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  In total, other investments increased $2.0 million, or 6.9% from June 30, 2016 as a result of additional FHLB stock purchases as required for our additional FHLB borrowings. 
  We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in market value. We do not believe that there are any other-than-temporary impairments at   September 30, 2016  ; therefore, no impairment losses have been recorded during the first   three   months of fiscal   2017  . 
  Loans held for sale.      Loans held for sale increased $3.0 million, or 52.7% at September 30, 2016 to $8.8 million from June 30, 2016. The increase was driven by volume increases as a result of expanding our mortgage operations into our newer market areas.  
  Loans.    Net loans receivable   increased     $49.0 million  , or   2.7%  , at   September 30, 2016   to   $1.9 billion   from   June 30, 2016   primarily due to $24.0 million in organic loan growth and $24.6 million in purchased HELOCs, net of repayments.  
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, retail loan portfolio originations increased $7.5 million from $67.1 million to $74.6 million, or 11.2% compared to the same period in the previous year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, commercial loan portfolio originations decreased $20.6 million from $97.5 million to $77.0 million, or 7.3% compared to the same period in the previous year.  The decrease in commercial loan originations was primarily a result of one loan origination occurring in the prior fiscal year's first quarter totaling $17.9 million.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, organic net loan growth, which excludes purchases of HELOCs was $24.0 million, or 5.7% annualized. Excluding the one-to-four family residential loan portfolio, our first quarter loan growth was $32.3 million or 11.4% annualized. Our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio continues to decline as a result of increasing customer demand for 30-year fixed rate loans, which we sell to third parties as compared to our shorter term fixed and variable rate loans that we retain in our loan portfolio - a trend we expect to continue during this low rate environment. 
  
   31 

Retail consumer and commercial loans consist of the following at the dates indicated:   

  Asset Quality.    Nonperforming assets   decreased   $1.8 million to   $22.7 million  , or   0.82%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $24.5 million, or 0.90% of total assets, at   June 30, 2016  . Nonperforming assets included   $17.0 million   in nonaccruing loans and   $5.7 million   in REO at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $18.5 million and $6.0 million, in nonaccruing loans and REO respectively, at June 30, 2016. Included in nonperforming loans are $6.3 million of loans restructured from their original terms of which $3.7 million were current with respect to their modified payment terms. The decrease in nonaccruing loans was primarily due to loans returning to performing status as payment history and the borrower's financial status improved. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $7.3 million  , or   42.7%  , of nonaccruing loans were current on their required loan payments. Purchased credit impaired loans aggregating $6.1 million were excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. 
  The ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to   2.07%   at   September 30, 2016   from 2.17% at June 30, 2016. Classified assets   decreased     3.1%   to   $57.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to $58.9 million at June 30, 2016. Delinquent loans (loans delinquent 30 days or more) decreased to   $18.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $19.5 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had identified   $43.6 million   of impaired loans compared to   $44.1 million   at June 30, 2016. Our impaired loans are comprised of loans on non-accrual status and all TDRs, whether performing or on non-accrual status under their restructured terms. Impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or on a collective basis as part of homogeneous pools. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were $21.6 million loans individually evaluated for impairment and   $22.0 million   were collectively evaluated. For more information on these impaired loans, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of this report. 
  Allowance for loan losses.    We establish an allowance for loan losses by charging amounts to the loan provision at a level required to reflect estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and current risk factors specifically related to each loan type. 
  The allowance for loan losses was   $21.0 million  , or 1.11% of total loans, at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $21.3 million  , or 1.16% of total loans, at   June 30, 2016  . The allowance for loan losses was 1.24% of gross loans at   September 30, 2016  , excluding acquired loans as the loans acquired from acquisitions are excluded from the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded these loans at fair value, which includes a credit discount, therefore, no allowance for loan losses is established for these acquired loans unless the credit quality deteriorates further subsequent to the acquisition.   
  There was no provision for loan loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. Net loan charge-offs totaled   $341,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $262,000 for the same period during the prior fiscal year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased slightly to   0.07%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from 0.06% for the same period last fiscal year. 
  The allowance as a percentage of nonaccruing loans increased to 123.2% at   September 30, 2016   from 115.0% at June 30, 2016.  
  We believe that the allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016   was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date.  While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our  
  
   32 

financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
  Real estate owned.   REO   decreased     $241,000  , to   $5.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The total balance of REO at   September 30, 2016   included $3.7 million in land, construction and development projects (both residential and commercial), $1.0 million in commercial real estate, and $961,000 in single-family homes. 
  Deferred income taxes.    Deferred income taxes decreased $2.1 million, or 3.8%, to $52.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $54.2 million at June 30, 2016. The realization of net operating losses through increases in net income was the primary driver in the decrease, but deferred income taxes were also further reduced by the revaluation of deferred tax assets relating to a change in North Carolina's corporate tax rate, as discussed below. 
  Deposits.    Deposits   decreased     $9.2 million  , or   0.5%  , to $1.8 billion at   June 30, 2016  . This decrease was primarily due to a managed run off of $25.4 million in higher cost certificates of deposit and brokered deposits partially offset by a net increase of $16.2 million in checking, savings, and money market accounts. 
  Borrowings.    Borrowings   increased   to   $536.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from $491.0 million at   June 30, 2016  . All FHLB advances have maturities of less than 90 days with a weighted average interest rate of 0.40% at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other liabilities.    Other liabilities decreased $4.3 million, or 7.0% to $57.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $62.0 million at June 30, 2016, primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease in official checks outstanding. 
  Equity.    Stockholders' equity at   September 30, 2016     increased   to   $364.4 million   from $360.0 million at   June 30, 2016  . The increase was a primarily a result of $3.8 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Tangible book value per share increased $0.26, or 1.4% to $19.31 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $19.05 at June 30, 2016.

Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost 
  The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest-earning assets), and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
  The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

_____________ 
  (1) Interest income used in the rate calculation includes the tax equivalent adjustment of $590,000 and $647,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, calculated based on a federal tax rate of 34%. 
   
  Comparison of Results of Operation for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  General.    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had net income of   $3.8 million  , a $1.2 million, or   49.1%   increase as compared to net income of   $2.6 million   for the   three   months ended September 30, 2015. On a basic and diluted per share basis, the Company earned   $0.22   per share for the first three months of fiscal year 2017, compared to   $0.14   per share in 2016. Earnings before merger-related expenses, certain state income tax expenses, and gain from the sale of premises and equipment were   $4.3 million  , or $0.25 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to   $3.1 million  , or $0.17 per share for the same period in the previous year. 
  Net Interest Income.    Net interest income increased   $566,000  , or   2.8%   to   $21.1 million   for the   three   months   September 30, 2016   compared to   $20.6 million   for the   three   months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was driven by a $782,000, or 3.6% increase in interest income and partially offset by a $216,000, or 15.0% increase in interest expense.  
  Interest income increased $782,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year, driven by an $845,000, or 4.3% increase in loan interest income and a $214,000, or 25.8% increase in interest from certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits. The additional loan interest income was due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and a $477,000, or 35.2% increase in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $1.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $1.4 million for the same quarter in 2015. 
  The average balance of interest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was   $2.5 billion   and was consistent with the comparable quarter in 2015. Net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased seven basis points to 3.44% from 3.37% for the same period last year. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $999,000 in interest income during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , at an average yield of 101 basis points, while the average cost of the borrowings was 42 basis points, resulting in approximately $589,000 in net interest income during the period. During the same three-month period in the prior fiscal year, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $664,000 in interest income, at an average yield of 60 basis points, while the average cost of borrowings was 21 basis points, resulting in approximately $433,000 in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the net interest margin would be 3.97% and 4.02% for the   three   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  
   35 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the average balance of loans receivable increased $119.2 million, or 6.9% from organic loan growth and the purchase of HELOCs, which partially led to the $845,000, or 4.3% increase in loan interest income. In addition, the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans increased $477,000, or 35.2% to $1.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $1.4 million for the same quarter in 2015. Accretable income on acquired loans stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on the PCI loan pools and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loan pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter. The amortization of purchase accounting discounts on loans increased the net interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) by 40 basis points for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a 20 basis points impact in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Overall, average loan yields decreased 13 basis points to 4.56% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from 4.69% in corresponding quarter in 2015. The decline compared to a year earlier primarily reflects lower average yields on loans recently originated and the refinancing of higher yielding loans as the relatively low interest rate environment continues.  
    
  Average interest-earning deposits with banks, investment securities, and other interest-earning assets, consisting of Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") stock, FHLB stock, and commercial paper had a cumulative decrease of $107.6 million, or 13.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year. This cumulative decrease partially offset the increase in interest income on loans by $63,000, or 2.7%.  
    
  Due to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of   September 30, 2016  , our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $576.5 million and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.02% of which $250.4 million, or 43.4%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points. 
  Interest expense   increased   by $216,000, or   15.0%   to   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   in comparison to 2015. This increase was primarily related to average borrowings, consisting of short-term FHLB advances, increasing by $58.0 million to $533.9 million due to our leveraging strategy, as well as a 21 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, primarily due to a $124.1 million decrease in average certificates of deposit to $430.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 as we continue to reduce higher rate certificates of deposit. The overall average cost of funds increased four basis points due primarily to the impact of the December 2015 increase in the federal funds rate on our borrowings.  
  Provision for Loan Losses.    There was no provision for loan losses during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015 as improved asset quality measures have been sufficient to offset the allowance needed for loan growth. Net charge-offs for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   $341,000   from   $262,000   for the same period in 2015. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased slightly to 0.07% for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from 0.06% for the same period last fiscal year.  
  See Comparison of Financial Condition - Asset Quality for additional details. 
  Noninterest Income.    Noninterest income   increased     $707,000  , or   21.0%  , to   $4.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a $248,000, or 34.1%, increase in mortgage banking income and fees. Reflecting our expansion into newer market areas and the continued low interest rate environment, originations of loans held for sale increased 72.5% to $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same quarter last year resulting in an increase in the volume of loans sold. In addition, we recognized a $385,000 gain on the sale of premises and equipment as we sold a previously closed branch office building during the current quarter. 
  Noninterest Expense.    Noninterest expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $870,000  , or   4.4%  , to   $19.0 million   compared to   $19.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The overall decrease was a result of management's focus on reducing operating expenses as shown in the cumulative decrease of $628,000, or 12.2% in net occupancy expense; marketing and advertising; telephone, postage, and supplies; and computer services. The $246,000, or 46.9% decrease in deposit insurance premiums was due to a decrease in the rates charged by the FDIC that occurred during the quarter. Partially offsetting these decreases were $307,000 of merger-related expenses as a result of our pending acquisition of TriSummit. 
  Income Taxes.    For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's income tax expense was   $2.4 million  , an increase of $883,000, or 57.3% compared to   $1.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was a result of pretax income for the quarter increasing $2.1 million, or 52.2% over the comparative quarter in prior year. In addition, the Company had a $490,000 and a $526,000 charge during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the decrease in value of our deferred tax assets based on recent decreases in North Carolina's corporate tax rate. The rate was reduced to 4.0% in August 2015 and to 3.0% in August 2016 once certain state revenue triggers were achieved. The Company's effective income tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   38.8%   compared to   37.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Liquidity 
  Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio. 
  
   36 

In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had an additional borrowing capacity of   $15.5 million   with the FHLB of Atlanta, a   $200.5 million   line of credit with the FRB and two lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $  60.0 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $536.5 million   in FHLB advances outstanding and nothing outstanding under our other lines of credit. Additionally, the Company classifies its securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our security portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. In addition, we have historically sold longer term fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At   September 30, 2016   brokered deposits totaled   $8.9 million  , or   0.5%   of total deposits. 
  Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper. HomeTrust Bancshares on a stand-alone level is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses. The Company's primary source of funds consists of the net proceeds retained from the Conversion. The Company also has the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of   $17.1 million  . 
  We use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At   September 30, 2016  , the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to   $163.8 million   and   $339.2 million  , respectively, as compared to   $164.8 million   and   $340.4 million  , respectively, as of   June 30, 2016  . Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $306.4 million  . It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with us. 
  During the first   three   months of fiscal   2017  , cash and cash equivalents   increased     $8.0 million  , or   15.1%  , from   $52.6 million   as of   June 30, 2016   to   $60.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Cash provided by financing activities was $36.3 million, while cash used in operating and investing activities was   $3.0 million   and   $25.3 million  , respectively. Primary sources of cash for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included $12.6 million in proceeds from the maturities of securities available for sale, a net increase in commercial paper of $9.7 million, $8.1 million in maturities of certificates of deposits in other banks, net of purchases, $6.6 million in principal repayments from mortgage-backed securities, and a $45.5 million increase in borrowings. Primary uses of cash during the period included a $9.2 million decrease in deposits, an increase in loans of $47.5 million, and $13.0 million in purchases of available for sale securities. All sources and uses of cash reflect our cash management strategy to increase our number of higher yielding investments and loans by increasing lower costing borrowings and reducing our holdings in lower yielding investments. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
  In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  A summary of our off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at   September 30, 2016  , is as follows (in thousands): 

Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , stockholder's equity totaled   $364.4 million  . HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the NCCOB and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank holding companies.  
  
   37 

Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as of that date.  Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a  well-capitalized  status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" at   September 30, 2016   under applicable regulatory requirements. 
  HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank's actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios     are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

In addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank now has to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted asses in January 2019. 
   
  Impact of Inflation 
  The effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions. While management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets, it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact. Management believes this to be the case due to the fact that  
  
   38 

generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index ("CPI") coincides with changes in interest rates. The price of one or more of the components of the CPI may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall CPI without having a corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the Company. In years of high inflation and high interest rates, intermediate and long-term interest rates tend to increase, thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities, mortgage loans and other long-term fixed rate loans. In addition, higher short-term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds. In other years, the opposite may occur. 
  
   39 

Item 3.          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
  There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in our   2016   Form 10-K. 
   
  Item 4.          Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")) as of   September 30, 2016  , was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer     and several other members of the Company's senior management.     The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In addition, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

  RULE 13a-14(a) CERTIFICATION 
  I, Dana L. Stonestreet, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company"); 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

              (b)

              5. 
    The Company's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
