PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1 -
Organization and Basis of Presentation   

Organization
and Line of Business   

Mountain High
Acquisitions Corp., formerly known as Wireless Attachments, Inc., (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Colorado on September 22, 2010. The Company was originally incorporated for the purpose of developing solar cloth
membranes for outdoor active wear that covert sunlight into electrical power and that can be used for charging and/or operating
mobile devices such as the iPod and the iPhone.  

The Company
is currently in the business of acquiring companies and technologies engaged in the development, production, sales and marketing
of CBD related products   

On April 30,
2015, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to sell Canna-Life Corporation (the  CL Agreement ), a
wholly owned subsidiary, to Evolution Equities Corporation and Alan Smith.( Purchasers ) Under the terms of the CL Agreement
the Company will sell 8,104,000 (100%) of its shares of Canna-Life and execute a note Payable for $80,000 to Evolutions Equities
Corporation in exchange for the extinguishment of $490,416 of debt due to the Purchasers at March 31, 2015 and $1.00 cash.  

On May 22, 2015
the Company completed the acquisition of Greenlife Botanix ( Greenlife ) as detailed in the First Amendment to the Shareholder
Agreement dated February 8, 2015. The Company issued 10,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Greenlife
in exchange for their 100% interest in Greenlife. The shares of were valued at the market value on the date of issuance, $0.23,
$2,300,000. The amount paid for Greenlife was recorded as Goodwill due to the start up nature of Greenlife and the minimal net
assets of Greenlife at the time of acquisition. Due changes in anticipated acquisitions and the remarketing of the Greenlife product
line, the Company evaluated the book value of the asset and elected to impair the Goodwill value of Greenlife and expensed the
$2,300,000 book value in the six months ended September 30, 2015.  

Going Concern   

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred a net loss of $269,549,
has an accumulated deficit of $5,666,264 and a working capital deficit of $473,760 as of September 30, 2016. These conditions
raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue
to raise capital to fund the Company s operations and believes that it can continue to raise equity or debt financing to
support its operations until the Company is able to generate positive cash flow from operations.  

Note
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( US GAAP ). The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented in United States
Dollars ($ or  USD ). The fiscal year end is March 31.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The accounts
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary GreenLife Botanix are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.  

Use of Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. It is possible that accounting estimates and assumptions may be material to the Company due to the
levels of subjectivity and judgment involved.  

Cash and
Cash Equivalents    

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.  

Revenue Recognition   

In accordance
with the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition ,
the Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company must meet all of the following four
criteria under SAB 104 to recognize revenue:  

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists  

  Delivery has occurred  

  The sales price is fixed or determinable  

  Collection is reasonably assured  

Inventories  

Inventories
consisting of cosmetic products are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method
and are adjusted to actual cost quarterly based on a physical count. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. 

Intangible Assets  

The Company accounts for intangibles in accordance
with ASC 350, Intangible-Goodwill and Other. The Company evaluates intangibles, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events
and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of intangibles is tested by comparing
the carrying amount to the fair value. The fair values are estimated using undiscounted projected net cash flows. If the carrying
amount exceeds its fair value, intangibles are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment
loss, if any. The Company evaluates the impairment of intangibles as of the end of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. These circumstances include: 

a
                                         significant decrease in the market value of an asset;    

a
                                         significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; or    

an
                                         accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the
                                         acquisition of an asset.    

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized
for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized
as a benefit only if it is  more likely than not  that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with
a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the  more likely than not  test, no tax benefit
is recorded. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties
that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Applicable interest and penalties associated with unrecognized
tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statements of operations. The open tax years are 2011, 2012, 2013,
2014, and 2015. 

The Company
has no tax positions at September 30, 2016, or March 31, 2016, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which
there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share   

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance
with the ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock warrants
were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, warrants are assumed
to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used
to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. There were 604,000 warrants outstanding at September 30,
2016, which were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Recent authoritative guidance issued by the
FASB (including technical corrections to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification), the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the SEC, did not, or are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

Note 3   Advances from Stockholder  

Alan Smith, the Company s Chief Executive
officer and a director, has advanced money to fund the Company s operations. The amount due to this stockholder at September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 was a 5% convertible note payable of $15,561 and $15,001, respectively. The $16,100 Advances from
related parties refers to an unsecured advance by the President of GreenLife Botanix, Brent McMahon. Mr. McMahon is not an officer
or Director of the Company. Mr. McMahon is a shareholder of MYHI stock. 

Note 4   Equity  

  Common Stock  

The Company has authorized 250,000,000 shares
of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per
share. 

In connection with a private placement offering,
in March 2014 the Company sold 604,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of the Company s common stock and a warrant
to purchase one share of the Company s common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $4.75 and expire on March 6,
2017. 

During March 2015, the Company sold 420,000
restricted shares of common stock through a private placement at $0.15 per share. These shares were issued on April 14,2015 

During the year ended March 31, 2016 the Company
issued 336,667 restricted shares through a private placement at $0.15 per share. 

On May 22, 2015, the Company issued
10,000,000 restricted shares to the shareholders of Greenlife Botanix pursuant to closing the Share Exchange Agreement dated
February 8, 2015. The shares were valued at the fair market trading value, $0.23, on the closing date. 

The Company issued 353,600 restricted shares
to a vendor in lieu of payment of $35,360 that was owed to the vendor at March 31, 2015. 

Pursuant to agreements with potential investors;
Alan Smith, CEO and a Director, retired 2,000,000 shares he received from the reverse merger referenced above. The share retirement
was valued at par $0.0001 per share. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company converted $162,629 of Notes Payable into 10,842,010 shares of common stock at $0.015 per share per the conversion agreements. 

Warrants  

The following table summarizes the warrant
activity: 

The number and weighted average exercise prices
of all warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

Note 5   Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes using
the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
based on anticipated future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax laws, attributable to temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts calculated for income tax purposes. 

The Company has federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $3,621,873, expiring in various years through 2037. The tax benefit of these net operating losses
has been offset by a full allowance for realization. The use of the net operating loss carryfowards may be limited due to the
change in control. 

Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following for the six
months ended September 30, 2016:  

The Company s effective tax rate differs from the high statutory
rate for the period ended September 30, 2016, due to the following (expressed as a percentage of pre-tax income):  

Federal taxes at statutory rate    
     $  34.0  %  
 
     State taxes, net of federal tax benefit    
        5.0  %  
 
     Valuation allowance    
        (39.0  )%  
 
     Effective income tax rate    
     $  0.0  %  

As of September 30, 2016, the components of these
temporary differences and the deferred tax asset were as follows:  

Note 6   Commitments and Contingencies  

None . 

Note 7 - Notes Payable  

During the Quarter ended September 30, 2016
the Company issued notes payable to private parties and converted some of these Notes Payable in to restricted common stock. Each
note had interest rates of 3%-5% and had a conversion provision allowing the holder to convert the note into shares of the Company
at a discount. The discount varied from 70% of the trading value at the conversion date to the lower of 80% of the share value
on the conversion date or $0.015, this is referred to as the Beneficial Conversion Feature,  BCF . Due to the fact that
the notes could be converted immediately or any time thereafter, there is no amortization of expense, so the Company has elected
to record an expense in the current year for the difference between the  BCF and the share value on the date the note was
executed, This resulted in an expense of $73,842 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and an aggregate expense of $253,640
to date through September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted $35,033 of existing
Notes Payable into 2,335,551 of common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also issued $68,267
of additional convertible Notes Payable. 

Note 8   Subsequent Events  

The Company has determined that there are no
subsequent events to report pertaining to the six months ended September 30, 2016.

Going Concern   

We have not attained profitable

auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue
as a going concern without further financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no significant
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to stockholders. 

Future Financings   

We will continue to rely
on equity sales of our common shares and advances from our majority stockholder in order to continue to fund our business operations.
Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any
additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our financial statements
and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on
a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We regularly evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included
in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information
from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this

The Company has implemented
all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
