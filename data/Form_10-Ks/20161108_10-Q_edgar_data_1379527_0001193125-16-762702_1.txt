  WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Master Fund   
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   
  September 30, 2016      (1)
Organization     The WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Fund (the  Fund   Fund  may also refer to the Fund and the Master Fund (as
defined below) collectively as the context requires) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on October 27, 2006, and WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Master Fund (the  Master Fund ) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on
October 27, 2006. WisdomTree Commodity Services, LLC (the  Managing Owner ) serves the Fund as commodity pool operator and managing owner.  
 Effective January 1, 2016, in accordance with the terms of a Unit Purchase Agreement dated October 29, 2015, GreenHaven LLC sold 100% of the issued
and outstanding membership interest in the Managing Owner to WisdomTree Investments Inc. Following the sale, the name of the Fund was changed from  GreenHaven Continuous Commodity Index Fund  to  WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index
Fund,  the name of the Master Fund was changed from  GreenHaven Continuous Commodity Index Master Fund  to  WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Master Fund,  and the name of the Managing Owner was changed from
 GreenHaven Commodity Services LLC  to  WisdomTree Commodity Services LLC.  As of January 1, 2016, the Fund s Sub-Advisor and commodity trading advisor is GreenHaven Advisors LLC.  
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the  Shares ). Upon inception of the Fund, 50 General Units of the Fund were issued to the
Managing Owner in exchange for a capital contribution of $1,500.    The proceeds from the offering of Shares are invested in the Master Fund (See Note 7 for
details of the procedures for creation and redemption of Shares in the Fund). The Master Fund actively trades exchange traded futures on the commodities comprising the Thomson Reuters Continuous Commodity Index (the  Index ), with a view
to tracking the performance of the Index over time. The Master Fund s Portfolio also includes U. S. Treasury obligations and other high credit-quality, short-term fixed income securities for deposit with the Master Fund s commodity broker
as margin. The Fund wholly owns the Master Fund. The Fund and Master Fund commenced investment operations on January 23, 2008 with the offering of 350,000 Shares in exchange for $10,500,000. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock
Exchange (now known as the NYSE Arca) on January 24, 2008 and, as of November 25, 2008, was listed on the NYSE Arca.    The Index is intended to
reflect the performance of certain commodities. Through January 6, 2013, the commodities comprising the Index (the  Index Commodities ) were: corn, soybeans, wheat, live cattle, lean hogs, gold, silver, copper, cocoa, coffee, sugar,
cotton, orange juice, platinum, crude oil, NY Harbor ULSD (formerly known as heating oil), and natural gas. The Index was revised on January 7, 2013 to include soybean oil and remove orange juice.  
 The Managing Owner and the Shareholders share in any profits and losses attributable to the Fund in proportion to the percentage interest owned by each.  
 The Managing Owner, the Funds, and the Master Fund retain the services of third party service providers for the ongoing operations of the Fund and the Master
Fund. (See Note (2)).    In accordance with Accounting Standard Update ( ASU )  2013-08,  Financial
Service-Investment Companies, the Fund qualifies as an investment company and is applying the accounting and reporting guidance for investment companies.  
  Unaudited Interim Financial Information     The financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of the Managing Owner, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on
the same basis as the annual financial statements and include all adjustments, which are of the normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the Fund s financial position, investments, results of operations and its cash flows.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be achieved for the year or for any other interim period or for any future year. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  
  (2) Service Providers and Related Party Agreements     (a)
 The Trustee    CSC Trust is the trustee for the Fund and Master Fund. CSC Trust is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.  
      17  

Table of Contents  

  (b)  The Managing Owner    WisdomTree Commodity Services, LLC (f/k/a GreenHaven Commodity
Services, LLC) is the managing owner of the Fund and Master Fund and is responsible for the day to day operations of both entities. The Managing Owner charges the Fund a management fee for its services. The Managing Owner is a Delaware limited
liability company with operations in New York, New York.    (c)  The Administrator    State Street Bank and Trust Company is the Fund s
Administrator. The Administrator performs or supervises the services necessary for the operation and administration of the Fund (other than making investment decisions) in accordance with various services agreements entered into with the Fund. These
services include calculating the daily Net Asset Value of the Fund (the  Net Asset Value ), accounting and other Fund administrative services. As the Fund s transfer agent, the Administrator processes creations and redemptions of
Shares. These transactions are processed on Depository Trust Company s ( DTC ) book entry system. The Administrator retains certain financial books and records, including: Basket creation and redemption books and records, fund
accounting records, ledgers with respect to assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses, the registrar, transfer journals and related details and trading and related documents received from futures commission merchants. State Street Bank and
Trust Company has an office in Boston, Massachusetts.    (d)  Commodity Broker    Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. )
is the Master Fund s Commodity Broker. In its capacity as the Commodity Broker, it executes and clears each of the Master Fund s futures transactions. MS Co. is based in New York, New York.  
 (e)  The Distributor    Foreside Fund Services LLC ( FFS ) is the Fund s Distributor. The Fund s Distributor assists the
Managing Owner and the Administrator with certain functions and duties relating to the creation and redemption of Baskets, including receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets, coordinating the
processing of such orders and related functions and duties. FFS has an office in Portland, Maine.    (f)  Authorized Participant   
Authorized Participants may create or redeem shares of the Fund. Each Authorized Participant must (1) be a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to
register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) be a participant in the DTC, and (3) have entered into a Participant Agreement with the Fund and the Managing Owner. The Participant Agreement sets forth the procedures for the
creation and redemption of Baskets of shares and for the delivery of cash required for such creations or redemptions. The current Authorized Participants are J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, and Morgan
Stanley   Co. Incorporated. A similar agreement between the Fund and Master Fund sets forth the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets of Master Units.  
  (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      (a)
Use of Estimates     The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the amounts of reported income and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     (b) Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
 No recently promulgated accounting standards are expected to have an effect on the Fund s financial statements.  
  (c) Cash Held by Broker     A portion of the Master
Fund s cash is held by MS Co. and is applied towards the daily variation margin movements on the Master Fund s open futures contracts. MS Co. allows the Master Fund to apply its U.S. Treasury Bill portfolio positions towards its
initial margin requirement for the Master Fund s futures positions, hence all cash held by broker is unrestricted cash. The cash and U.S. Treasury Bill positions are held in segregated accounts at MS Co. and are not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.     (d) U. S. Treasury Obligations   
 The Master Fund records purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury Obligations on a trade date basis. These holdings are marked to market based on quotations from
broker-dealers or independent service providers. The Master Fund may hold U.S. Treasury Obligations for deposit with the Commodity Broker as margin for trading and holding against initial margin of the open futures contracts. Interest income is
recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the U.S. Treasury Obligations.  
      18  

Table of Contents  

   (e) Income Taxes   
 The Fund and Master Fund are classified as a grantor trust and a partnership respectively, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, neither the Fund
nor the Master Fund is subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal, state, or local income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as investors are individually
liable for income taxes, if any, on their allocable share of the Fund s share of the Master Fund s income, gain, loss, deductions and other items.  
 The Fund accounts for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to the applicable accounting standard, which provides measurement, presentation and disclosure
guidance related to uncertain tax positions. The guidance addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Fund may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.  
  (f) Futures Contracts     The Master Fund purchases and
holds commodity futures for investment purposes. These contracts are recorded on a trade date basis and open contracts are valued daily at settlement prices provided by the relevant exchanges. In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition,
commodity futures are presented at their published settlement prices on the last business day of the period, in accordance with the fair value accounting standard. Since these contracts are actively traded in markets that are directly observable and
which provide readily available price quotes, their market value is deemed to be their fair value under the fair value accounting standard. (See Note 4   Fair Value Measurements). However, when market closing prices are not available, the
Managing Owner may value an asset of the Master Fund pursuant to such other principles as the Managing Owner deems fair and equitable provided such principles are consistent with the fair value accounting standard. Realized gains (losses) and
changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes
occur, respectively.     (g) Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   
 All of the capital raised by the Fund is used to purchase common units of beneficial interest of the Master Fund. The financial statement balances of the
Master Fund are consolidated with the Fund s financial statement balances and all significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. Separate financial statements of the Master Fund are presented to comply with SEC reporting
requirements as the Master Fund is a separate SEC registrant.     (h) Subsequent Events   
 For purposes of disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, the Fund has evaluated events occurring between the period ended September 30, 2016
and when the financial statements were issued.    During that period, 50,000 Limited Shares were created on November 2, 2016 and 0 Limited Shares were
redeemed resulting in 11,000,000 Limited Shares outstanding.    On October 4, 2016, the Managing Owner issued a press release announcing that the Fund had
temporarily suspended the ability of Authorized Participants to purchase new Baskets of Shares. The Fund filed the press release with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K on October 4, 2016.  
 On October 31, 2016, the Managing Owner announced that the Fund lifted its temporary suspension of the ability of Authorized Participants to purchase new
Baskets of Shares, and resumed the creation of new Baskets of Shares. The Fund filed the press release with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K on October 31, 2016.  
 Other than these events, the evaluation did not result in any subsequent events that necessitated disclosures and/or adjustments.  
  (4) Fair Value Measurements     The existing guidance for
fair value measurements establishes the authoritative definition for fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and outlines the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Fund uses a three-tier fair
value hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs as follows:    Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.    Level 2   Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or    liability, either directly or indirectly.  
 Level 3   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  
      19  

Table of Contents  

  The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities. The assets of the Fund are either exchange-traded securities that are valued at the official closing price on the exchange where they are principally traded or U.S. government securities that are valued using
dealer and broker quotations or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. A summary of the Fund s assets and liabilities at fair value as of September 30, 2016, classified according to the levels
used to value them, is as follows:      
   There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the Fund during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
Fund did not hold any Level 3 securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    A summary of the Fund s assets and liabilities at
fair value as of December 31, 2015, classified according to the levels used to value them, is as follows:      
   There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the Fund during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Fund did
not hold any Level 3 securities during the year ended December 31, 2015.     (5) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   
 The Fund uses derivative instruments as part of its principal investment strategy to achieve its investment objective. As of September 30, 2016, the Fund
was invested in commodity futures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, the volumes of derivative activity (based on average month-end notional amounts) were $219,094,034 and $247,056,205,
respectively.    The fair value of derivative instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:  

(i) 
 Values are disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition under  Net unrealized depreciation on futures contracts .    
      20  

Table of Contents  

  The following is a summary of the realized and unrealized gains and losses of the derivative instruments utilized
by the Fund for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      

(i) 
 Values are disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses under  Net realized gain (loss) from futures contracts.      

(ii) 
 Values are disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses under  Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from futures contracts.      
  (6) Financial Instrument Risk     In the normal course of
its business, the Fund may be party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result
in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are commodity futures, whose values are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or
through physical delivery. These instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts.    Market risk is the potential for changes in the
value of the financial instruments traded by the Fund due to market changes, including fluctuations in commodity prices. In entering into these contracts, there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by conditions,
resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interest positions at the same time, and the Managing Owner is unable to offset such positions, the Fund could experience substantial losses.  
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of an exchange clearinghouse to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit
risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as counterparty to the transactions. The Fund s risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to
the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments.  
 The Fund and the Master Fund have not utilized, nor do they expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet
financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business.  
  (7) Share Creations and Redemptions      (a) Creation of
Shares      General.  On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Fund s Distributor (as facilitated by the
Fund s Administrator) to create one or more Baskets. For purposes of processing both purchase and redemption orders, a  business day  means any day when NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 10:00
a.m., New York time. The day on which a valid purchase order is received is the purchase order date. Purchase orders are irrevocable. By placing a purchase order, and prior to delivery of such Baskets, an Authorized Participant s DTC account
will be charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.     Determination of Required Payment.  The total payment required to
create each Basket is the Net Asset Value of 50,000 Shares as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Index Commodities are traded, whichever is later, on the purchase order date. Baskets will be
issued as of 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day immediately following the purchase order date at Net Asset Value per Share as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Index Commodities are
traded, whichever is later, on the purchase order date during the continuous offering period, but only if the required payment has been timely received.  
 Because orders to create Baskets must be placed by 10:00 a.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a Basket during the continuous offering
period will not be determined until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a Basket at the time they submit an irrevocable
purchase order for the Basket. The Fund s Net Asset Value and the total amount of the payment required to create a Basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of
the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

   Rejection of Purchase Orders.  The Administrator may reject a creation order if:  
 (i) it determines that the creation order is not in proper form;  
 (ii) the Managing Owner believes that the purchase order would have adverse tax consequences to the Fund  
 or its Shareholders; or    (iii)
circumstances outside the control of the Managing Owner or the Distributor make it, for all practical    purposes, not feasible to process
creations of Baskets.    The Distributor and the Managing Owner will not be liable for the rejection of any purchase order.  
  (b) Redemption of Shares      General.  The procedures
by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Distributor (as facilitated by the Administrator) to
redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 10:00 a.m., New York time. The day on which a valid redemption order is received in proper form is the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. Individual Shareholders
may not redeem directly from the Fund.    By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through
DTC s book-entry system to the Fund not later than 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption distribution, an Authorized
Participant s DTC account will be charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.     Determination of Required Payment. 
The redemption proceeds from the Fund consists of the cash redemption amount equal to the Net Asset Value of the number of Basket(s) requested in the Authorized Participant s redemption order as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last
to close of the exchanges on which the Index Commodities are traded, whichever is later, on the redemption order date. The Managing Owner will distribute the cash redemption amount at 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day immediately
following the redemption order date through DTC to the account of the Authorized Participant as recorded on DTC s book entry system.     Delivery of
Redemption Proceeds.  The redemption proceeds due from the Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date if, by such time, the Fund s DTC
account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If the Fund s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Baskets received.
Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Baskets received if the Distributor receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the
Distributor may, from time-to-time, determine and the remaining Baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Fund s DTC account by 12:00 p.m., New York time, on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall
be cancelled. The Distributor is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund s DTC account by 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the business day immediately
following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book entry system on such terms as the Distributor and the Managing Owner may from time-to-time agree upon.
    Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders.  The Managing Owner may suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date,
(1) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the redemption distribution is not reasonably practicable, or (2) for such other period as the Managing Owner determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders.
The Managing Owner will not be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.    A
redemption order may be rejected if the order is not in proper form as described in the order form and/or Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.  
  (8) Operating Expenses      (a) Management Fee   
 The Fund pays the Managing Owner a management fee (the  Management Fee ) monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.85% per annum of the
average daily net asset value of the Master Fund. The management fee incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $478,945 and $536,536 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,398,546 and
$1,608,998, respectively. The Management Fees were charged to the Fund and paid to the Managing Owner.  
      22  

Table of Contents  

   (b) Organization and Offering Expenses   
 Expenses incurred in connection with organizing the Fund and the offering of the Shares were paid by GreenHaven, LLC. GreenHaven, LLC is the former sole member
of the Managing Owner. The Fund does not have an obligation to reimburse GreenHaven, LLC or its affiliates for organization and offering expenses paid on their behalf.  
  (c) Brokerage Commissions, Fees, and Routine Operational, Administrative, and Other Ordinary Expenses   
 The Fund will pay to the Commodity Brokers all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees. National Futures Association fees, give-up fees, pit
brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker are expected to be less than $20.00 per round-turn trade, although the Commodity
Broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The Fund will also reimburse the Managing Owner for any routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund and the
Master Fund paid by the Managing Owner (including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, filing fees, and printing, mailing and duplication costs), out of any
remaining portion of the 0.20% of the Fund s Net Asset Value accrued for the payment of brokerage commissions and fees.    Brokerage commissions and
fees are charged against the Fund s assets on a per transaction basis. The brokerage commissions, trading fees and routine operational, administrative, and other ordinary expenses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $112,692 and $126,244 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $329,067 and $378,588, respectively.     (9)
Termination     The term of the Fund is perpetual, unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances as defined in the Trust Agreement.  
  (10) Profit and Loss Allocations and Distributions     The
Managing Owner and the Shareholders share in any profits and losses of the Fund attributable to the Fund in proportion to the percentage interest owned by each. Distributions may be made at the sole discretion of the Managing Owner on a pro-rata
basis in accordance with the respective capital balances of the Shareholders, but the Fund is under no obligation to make periodic distributions to Shareholders. The Fund made no distributions to its Shareholders during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.     (11) Commitments and Contingencies   
 The Managing Owner, either in its own capacity or in its capacity as the Managing Owner and on behalf of the Fund, has entered into various service agreements
that contain a variety of representations, or provide indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interest of the Fund. As of September 30, 2016, no claims had
been received by the Fund and it was therefore not possible to estimate the Fund s potential future exposure under such indemnification provisions.  
  (12) Net Asset Value and Financial Highlights     The Fund
is presenting the following Net Asset Value and financial highlights related to investment performance and operations for a Limited Share outstanding for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The total return at
Net Asset Value is based on the change in Net Asset Value of the Shares during the period and the total return at market value is based on the change in market value of the Shares on the NYSE Arca during the period. An individual investor s
return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions.

Item 2.  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation        The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Funds  Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Funds  Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.   
  This Quarterly Report, including this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,  contains
forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Funds  actual results, performance or
achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Funds  future plans,
strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words  may,   will,   should,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   intend  or
 project,  the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Funds cannot assure investors that these
projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. The Funds  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.   
   Overview/Introduction      The Fund seeks to track
changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Thomson Reuters Continuous Commodity Index Total Return over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Master Fund s interest income from its holdings of U.S. Treasury Obligations and other
high credit-quality short-term fixed income securities over the expenses of the Funds. The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in an equal-weight portfolio of commodity futures.  
 The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund pursues its investment objective by
investing in a Portfolio of exchange-traded futures contracts on the commodities comprising the Index. Through January 6, 2013, the Index Commodities were wheat, corn, soybeans, live cattle, lean hogs, gold, silver, platinum, copper, cotton,
coffee, cocoa, orange juice, sugar, crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas. Following the tenth revision on January 7, 2013, orange juice was removed and soybean oil was added at an equivalent allocation.  
 The Index is composed of notional amounts of each of the Index Commodities. The notional amounts of each Index Commodity included in the Index are in equal
weight proportion to the Index Commodities or 1/17 weighting per index commodity rebalanced daily. The Master Fund s Portfolio also includes U.S. Treasury Obligations and other high credit-quality short-term fixed income securities for deposit
with the Master Fund s Commodity Broker. The Commodity Broker currently applies part of the total value of the cash and/or U.S. Treasury Obligations on deposit towards satisfying any margin requirements related to the futures contracts in the
Master Fund s futures account. The Index Sponsor is Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters is not an affiliate of the Fund, the Master Fund or the Managing Owner.  
 Under the Trust Agreements of each of the Fund and the Master Fund, CSC Trust, the Trustee of the Funds, has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive
management and control of all aspects of the business of the Funds. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing
Owner.    The Index Sponsor obtains information for inclusion in, or for use in the calculation of, the Index from sources the Index Sponsor considers
reliable. None of the Index Sponsor, the Managing Owner, the Fund, the Master Fund or any of their respective affiliates accepts responsibility for or guarantees the accuracy and/or completeness of the Index or any data included in the Index  
 The Shares are intended to provide investment results that generally correspond to the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the Index over time.
The value of the Shares is expected to fluctuate in relation to changes in the value of the Master Fund s Portfolio. The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the Net Asset Value per Share, but these two valuations are expected to
be very close.    The ticker symbol of the Fund is  GCC.   
   Performance Summary      There is no performance
history prior to the beginning of trading on January 24, 2008. For current five-year performance history subsequent to the beginning of trading, see the   Results of Operations   section below.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

    Net Asset Value    
 The Administrator calculates a Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund daily, based on closing prices of the underlying futures contracts. The first such
calculation was as of market close on January 24, 2008, the first day of trading. Values of the underlying Index are computed by Thomson Reuters America, LLC, and disseminated by NYSE Arca every 15 seconds during the trading day. Only
settlement and last-sale prices are used in the Index s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized   including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months,
the previous days  settlement price is used. This means that the underlying Index may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the Index value is based on the settlement prices of the component
commodities, and explains why the underlying Index often closes at or near the high or low for the day.      Critical Accounting Policies    
 Critical accounting policies for the Fund and Master Fund are as follows:  
 Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of
appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires the Managing Owner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Both the Fund and the Master Fund apply these policies that involve judgments and actual results may differ from the
estimates used.    The Master Fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and U.S. Treasury Obligations, both of which are recorded
on a trade date basis and at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of income and expenses. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related
unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the Fund s consolidated financial statements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).    When market closing prices are not available,
the Managing Owner may value an asset of the Master Fund pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards.  
 Interest income on U.S. Treasury Obligations is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted over the life of
the U.S. Treasury Obligations.    Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized gain (loss) on open positions are determined on a specific
identification basis and recognized in the consolidated statements of income and expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively.  
   Asset Valuation      The Fund records its futures
contracts and U.S. Treasury Obligations on a trade date basis and at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of income and expenses.  
 In determining fair value of U.S. Treasury Obligations and commodity futures, the Fund uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets and a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further information
regarding this accounting policy.      Market Risk    
 See Item 1A   Risk Factors and Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a complete discussion of market
risk.

Table of Contents  

    Credit Risk    
 The Master Fund holds two types of investments. The first is long positions in futures contracts on the seventeen commodities in the Index. Since the Index
allocates equally among the components and is rebalanced daily, performance risk of the futures contracts is divided equally among the components. Each of the component commodities is traded on the CME Group or ICE exchanges.  
 The CME Group and ICE exchanges guarantee the performance of its outstanding futures contracts. Each exchange is also publicly traded and, in
management s opinion, well-capitalized. Each uses a system of margining and daily cash settlement of unrealized gains and losses in open positions, which reduces counterparty risk for market participants. Hence, management believes that the
Fund faces minimal credit or counterparty risk in its futures trading and contract positions.    The Master Fund will also hold significant cash balances
representing the excess of invested funds above the margin requirements for its futures positions. To the extent practical, the Fund will hold this excess cash in short-term U.S. Treasury Obligations. Hence, management assigns no counterparty risk
to such holdings.      Liquidity      The Funds do not
anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Master Fund meets liquidity needs in the normal course of business from cash, cash equivalents, and/or from the sale of U.S. Treasury Obligations it holds. The
Funds  liquidity needs include: redeeming Shares, providing margin deposits for existing futures contracts, the purchase of additional futures contracts and paying expenses.  
 The Funds generate cash primarily from (i) the sale of creation Baskets, (ii) the sale of futures contracts, and (iii) interest earned on cash, cash
equivalents and investments in collateralizing U.S. Treasury Obligations. Substantially all of the net assets of the Master Fund are allocated to trading in futures contracts. Most of the assets of the Master Fund are held in U.S. Treasury
Obligations, cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in futures contracts. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the
futures contracts change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the Master Fund is paid to the Master Fund.    The investments of the Master Fund in
futures contracts could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. Such conditions could prevent the Master Fund from promptly liquidating a position in futures contracts.  
   Contractual Obligations      The Fund s
contractual obligations are with the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Master Fund s Net Asset Value. Commissions paid by the Fund to the
Commodity Broker are on a per trade basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments and commissions related to future trades.  
   Off-Balance Sheet Risk      In the normal course of
business, the Funds are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a
future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are standardized commodity futures traded on regulated exchanges and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value pursuant to the accounting standards for derivatives and
hedging activities,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.  As of the balance sheet date, the Funds have no unrecorded liabilities relating to futures contracts. However, until these contracts are closed, they will
fluctuate in value with changing commodity prices.      Results of Operations    
  FOR THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   
 The Fund was launched on January 23, 2008 at $30.00 per share and listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, formerly the American Stock Exchange, on
January 24, 2008.

   PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.   

The Fund and the Master Fund seek to track changes in the Thomson Reuters Equal Weight Continuous Commodity Index-Total
Return, or the  Index , over time. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Fund s Net Asset Value underperformed the Index by 1.03% and 0.70%, respectively.  

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         Introduction    
 The Funds are designed to replicate a commodity index. The market-sensitive instruments held by the Master Fund are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike
an operating company, the risk of market-sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Funds  main line of business.    Market movements
can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Master Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flows. The Funds  market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the price of commodities.  
   Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure    
 The Funds are unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital
resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties that will have a material effect on operations.      Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing
Risk Exposure      Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a
distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary powers increase, but remain circumscribed. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or
man-made disasters. The Managing Owner does not apply risk management techniques. The Master Fund initiates positions only on the  long  side of the market and does not employ  stop-loss  techniques.  
 Accordingly, tabular presentations of Market Risk or Sensitivity or Value-at-Risk analyses thereof are not applicable.

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures         Disclosure controls and procedures   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of the Managing Owner, including its chief executive officer and principal financial
officer, the Fund carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f))  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the Fund were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 The Managing Owner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Managing Owner s internal
control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  
 The Managing Owner does not believe that there have been any change in the Fund s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.
