NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS, PRESENTATION AND GOING
CONCERN  

Organization   

Freedom Leaf, Inc. (the  Company, 
 we,   us,   our,  or  Freedom Leaf ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
February 21, 2013, under the name of Arkadia International, Inc. The Company was originally engaged in the business of the acquisition
of in demand equipment, cars, and goods with the intent to resale these in the U.S. territory or export to overseas countries. 

On October 3, 2014, the Company experienced
a change in control. Richard C. Cowan acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance
with stock purchase agreements by and between Mr. Cowan and Vladimir and Galina Shekhtman ( Sellers ). On the closing
date, October 3, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Cowan purchased from the Sellers 6,950,100 shares
of the Company s outstanding restricted common stock for $100,000, representing 93%. 

On November 6, 2014, the Company merged
with Freedom Leaf, Inc., a private Nevada corporation. The Company changed its name from Arkadia International, Inc., to Freedom
Leaf, Inc. As a result of the merger, the private company was dissolved. See Note 2 for related discussion. 

For financial reporting
purposes, the Share Exchange represents a  reverse merger  rather than a business combination and Private Company is
deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization.
Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (Freedom Leaf, Inc., f/k/a Arkadia International,
Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical
financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at the historical cost
basis of the Private Company, and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities
of the Public Company and the Private Company, and the historical operations of Private Company and operations of both companies
from the closing date of the Share Exchange. 

Nature of Operations   

The Company is focused on being the premium
national and international news source for the Cannabis/Industrial Hemp industry. Through our online and print media channels,
our efforts are in dissemination of current legislation and legal news, arts and entertainment. Additional websites and online
partnerships are in the development stage that will give the Freedom Leaf brand greater exposure. The Company generates revenue
from paid advertising on both online and print publications as well as consulting fees and incubator fees for companies that want
to participate in the Cannabis/Industrial Hemp industry. Another segment of income generation by the Company is brand management
for both profit and non-profit organizations. An example is the contract with NORML which was entered into on May 26, 2015. This
contract authorizes the Company to undertake all of the commercial activities of NORML, earning income for both the non-profit
and the Company. 

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements of Freedom Leaf, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The results of operations for the interim period
ended September 30, 2016 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year
ending June 30, 2017. In the opinion of the Company s management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s results of operations, financial
position and cash flows. The unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed on October 7, 2016 and Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

The Company accounts for long-lived
assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360-10,  Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs
to sell.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company measures its financial assets
and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments, including
cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short term loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 

We follow accounting guidance for financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires
certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based
payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach
(present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement
cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little
or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market
participant would use. 

We currently measure and report at fair
value our intangible assets (due to our impairment analysis) and derivative liabilities. The fair value of intangible assets has
been determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows method. The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured
using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The following table summarizes our non-financial assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016: 

Following is a summary of activity through
September 30, 2016 of the fair value of intangible assets valued using Level 3 inputs: 

The Company evaluates its convertible
debt, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as
derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair
value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value
is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon
conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that
fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company accounts for stock-based instruments
issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations
the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of
an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line
attribution method. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition
provisions ASC Topic 505-50. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. 

Going Concern   

The Company has generated limited revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $120,554, has recurring net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
of $401,892, and a working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016 of $296,322, and used cash in operations of $21,878 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had a stockholders  deficit
and accumulated deficit of $407,352 and $4,412,230, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying condensed financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue its operations
is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity
markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company
were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying
value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

There can be no assurances that the Company
will be successful in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources to be used for operations. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities
that might be necessary. Based on the Company s current resources, the Company will not be able to continue to operate without
additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations,
the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period
for intangible assets, valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets, depreciable lives of the web site and property
and equipment, valuation of warrants and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts, valuation of derivatives, valuation of share-based
payments and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 

Reclassifications   

Certain amounts in the prior period financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
losses, total assets, or stockholders  equity as previously reported. 

Development Stage Company   

Since inception, the Company became a  development
stage company  as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 915  Development Stage Entities.  On June 10, 2014 the FASB issued authoritative guidance
which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity. The incremental reporting requirements for presenting the development
stage operations and cash flows since inception will no longer apply to development stage entities. The amendments of Topic 915
are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014. The Company has elected
early adoption of this guidance effective with the filing of its previous quarterly report.

  (f/k/a Arkadia International, Inc.)  

  Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

On November 6, 2014, the Company merged
with Freedom Leaf, Inc., a private Nevada corporation. The Company changed its name from Arkadia International, Inc., to Freedom
Leaf, Inc. As a result of the merger, the private company was dissolved. See Note 2 for related discussion. 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

In accordance with ASC 260-10,  Earnings
Per Share,  basic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) for the period by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common
stock equivalent shares which may dilute future earnings per share consist of convertible notes convertible into 20,225,000 common
shares. Equivalent shares are not utilized when the effect is anti-dilutive. 

Segment Information   

In accordance with the provisions of ASC
280-10,  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,  the Company is required to report financial
and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company does not have any operating segments as of September
30, 2016 and 2015. 

Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements
as issued. No new pronouncements had any material effect on these unaudited financial statements. The accounting pronouncements
issued subsequent to the date of these unaudited financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated
for the potential effect on these unaudited financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements
will have a material effect on these unaudited financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future
restatement of these unaudited financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued
subsequent to September 30, 2016 through the date these unaudited financial statements were issued. 

NOTE 2   ENTRY INTO A DEFINITIVE
AGREEMENT  

Freedom Leaf, Inc., (f/k/a Arkadia International,
Inc., the  Public Company,   we,   us,   our ) entered into a share exchange agreement
(the  Exchange Agreement ) with Freedom Leaf, Inc. (the  Private Company ), a Nevada corporation. Prior
to the reverse merger, Richard C. Cowan, an officer and director of the Company, post-merger, acquired 89,808,000, or 99.8% of
the outstanding shares of Freedom Leaf, Inc., the public company. Clifford J. Perry, an individual, and the Private Company s
sole officer and director ( Perry ), was the owner of record of all of the outstanding common shares of the Private
Company (the  Private Company Stock ). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the shareholders of the
Public Company (the  Shareholders ) and the cancellation by the Private Company of the certificates evidencing the
Private Company Stock as registered in the name of the Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Public Company in the
register of Shareholders maintained by Private Company as the new holder of the Public Company Stock and the issuance of the certificates
evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Private Company Stock in the name of the Public Company, the Public Company will
issue 83,401,200 shares (the  New Shares ) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of
the Company s common stock to the Shareholders (or their designees), and Perry will cause 100% of the shares of the Private
Company s common stock that he owns (the  Perry Stock,  together with the New Shares, the  Acquisition
Stock ) to be transferred to the Shareholders (or their designees), which collectively shall represent 48.1% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the Public Company immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the Private Company Stock, representing
100% of the issued share capital of the Private Company. As a result of the exchange of the Private Company Stock for the Acquisition
Stock (the  Share Exchange ), the Private Company will be dissolved. 

The closing of the Exchange Agreement was
conditioned upon certain, limited customary representations and warranties, as well as the satisfaction or waiver of specified
conditions to closing. As the parties satisfied all of the closing conditions, on November 6, 2014, we consummated the Share Exchange
contemplated by the Exchange Agreement. As a result, the shareholders of Private Company own approximately 48.1% of our issued
and outstanding common stock. 

Prior to the execution and delivery of
the Exchange Agreement, our board of directors approved the Share Exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby. Similarly,
the board of directors of Private Company approved the Share Exchange. Reference is hereby made regarding the completion of the
Share Exchange.

  Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

Following the Share Exchange, we have abandoned
our prior business plan and we are now pursuing Private Company s historical businesses. 

The foregoing description of the Exchange
Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Share Exchange Agreement, a copy of which has
been filed on Form 10-Q/A for the period ended December 31, 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Accounting Treatment of the Merger  

For financial reporting purposes, the Share
Exchange represents a  reverse merger  rather than a business combination and Private Company is deemed to be the accounting
acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. Private Company
is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (Freedom Leaf, Inc., f/k/a Arkadia International, Inc.)
is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial
statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of
the Private Company, and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities
of the Public Company and the Private Company, and the historical operations of Private Company and operations of both companies
from the closing date of the Share Exchange. 

Licensing Rights  

On February 8, 2016, the Company and Freedomleaf
Netherlands, b.v. ( FLNL ), a company located in the Netherlands, executed a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ),
wherein the Company granted FLNL a right of first refusal to license certain rights from the Company described below in exchange
for a payment of $25,000, and the parties agreed to negotiate a definite license agreement for such rights and with proposed terms
of the definitive agreement set forth in the MOU. Such rights include FLNL s rights to use various trademarks of the Company,
primarily  Freedom Leaf,  and other related rights, for use in the Netherlands by FLNL, including FLNL s right
to publish a Freedom Leaf magazine in the Netherlands, sell Freedom Leaf products and perform other activities related to the business
of the Company. Except for the grant of the right of first refusal, and the required payment has not been received by the Company.
FLNL is a shareholder (common stock and warrants to purchase additional common stock) of the Company. 

Incubation Agreement  

On January 18, 2016, the Company and Plants
to Paper, LLC ( PTP ), executed an Incubation Agreement. PTP owns the patent pending application 62/245,153 with the
title being  Rolling Papers and Blunt Wraps made from 100% Marijuana.  PTP transferred its ownership rights to the
Company and its Medical Marijuana / Cannabis / Hemp Industry Incubator program. The Company will supply management services and
to fund the early stage development of PTP. The Incubation Agreement is for a period of twelve months. PTP will provide the Company
with 20% of the outstanding membership shares of PTP in exchange for its services. The costs of patent registrations in the United
States and other countries will be the liability of PTP. As of June 30, 2016, PTP had no activity. 

NOTE 3   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Legal Matters  

From time to time, the Company may become
subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is not currently
a party to any material legal proceedings, nor is the Company aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that would have
a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition should such litigation
be resolved unfavorably. 

Lease Commitment

discussed in prior notes, as the Company s common stock continues to be thinly traded. Additionally, the Company issued Swiss
Allied four warrants as an incentive to the note, each for 20,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, for a total of

Allied exercises all warrants, the Company would receive an additional $400,000 for said shares of common stock. If Swiss Allied
does not exercise all 80,000,000 warrants, by the maturation dates, as described herein, the exercise price shall be adjusted to
$0.06, an increase of $0.055 per share as a penalty, which is payable to the Company at the time Swiss Allied requests to have
the Rule 144 restriction removed. The interest rate for each loan tranche is 8% and is accrued with a payment date of December
15, 2016 for the first tranche and January 15, 2017 for the second tranche. The conversion price for the $100,000, which may happen
any time prior to December 14, 2016, shall be the greater of $0.03 or 50% of the lowest closing price on the primary trading market

date, assuming that Swiss Allied has not exercised all 80,000,000 warrants for common stock. The conversion price for the $100,000,
assuming that Swiss Allied has exercised all 80,000,000 warrants for common stock, shall be $0.005 per share. Swiss Allied has
a right of first refusal on any future funding to the Company. Swiss Allied has the right to name a party to serve as a member
of the Company s board of directors if Swiss Allied owns at least 40,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
If Swiss Allied owns at least 80,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, they have the right to name two parties to
the Company s board of directors. The two directors will remain as long as Swiss Allied owns 55,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock. As of March 31, 2016, Swiss Allied had not exercised the first warrant therefore, the warrant had expired as of said
date. On April 8, 2016, Swiss Allied converted warrants for 4,800,000 shares of common stock in exchange for $24,000. The Company
agreed to amend the obligations of Swiss Allied to accommodate the extension of the warrant until June 5, 2016. As of June 30,

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

SPECIAL NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

We believe that it is important to communicate
our future expectations to our security holders and to the public. This report, therefore, contains statements about future events
and expectations which are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects
under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You
can expect to identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  may,   might,   could, 
 would,   will,   anticipate,   believe,   plan,   estimate, 
 project,   expect,   intend,   seek  and other similar expressions. Any statement
contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. Although we
believe that the plans, objectives, expectations and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are
reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements,
and we can give no assurance that our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects will be achieved.  

Important factors that might cause our
actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in the  Risk
Factors  section of and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and in our subsequent
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion of our results of operations should be read together
with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  

Company Overview  

The Company was
a startup company that was incorporated in Nevada under the name Arkadia International, Inc. on February 21, 2013. 

On October 3, 2014, the Company experienced
a change in control. Richard C. Cowan acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance
with stock purchase agreements by and between Mr. Cowan and Vladimir and Galina Shekhtman ( Sellers ). On the closing
date, October 3, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Cowan purchased from the Sellers 6,950,100 shares
of the Company s outstanding restricted common stock for $100,000, representing 93%. 

On November 4, 2014, the Company's
Board of Directors declared a twelve for one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.
As the stock split was approved by FINRA, the common share and per common share data in these financial statements and related
notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the stock split. The total number of authorized common
shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split. 

On November 6,
2014, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Freedom Leaf, Inc., a Nevada corporation
( Private Company ), and the Company s sole officer and director Clifford J. Perry ( Perry ), being
the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of Freedom Leaf, Inc. (the  FL Stock ). Pursuant to the Exchange
Agreement, the Shareholders received an aggregate of 83,401,200 shares (48.1%) our common stock (consisting of a new issuance of
shares and Mr. Perry s transfer of all of his shares) and we received the FL Stock. As a result of the exchange of the FL
Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the  Share Exchange ), Freedom Leaf, Inc. became our Company whereas the operations
of Arkadia International, Inc. ceased, and there was a change of control of the Company. 

Prior to the Share
Exchange, we were a startup company that originally intended to engage in the business of the acquisition of in demand equipment,
cars, and goods with the intent to resell these in the in the U.S. territories or export to overseas countries. 

We have had limited
operations and have been issued a  going concern  opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our
common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations. 

We have been devoting substantially all
of our efforts to migrate to the news, arts and entertainment niche, with both  in print  and online publications.
The Company is generating revenue through paid advertising in publications, both print and online, in the cannabis/hemp marketplace.
The Company will also earn revenue from providing consulting services to companies who are in our industry, contracting with companies
to brand, market, and sell their products and/or services, provide seminars in this space, and sell branded products for the Company
and others the Company represents. We have also started incubating other companies in the cannabis industry and have one
company that we are currently incubating. 

Plan of Operation  

We are currently devoting substantially
all of our efforts in the news, multi-media arts and entertainment industry, with both in print and online publications.   

Results of Operations  

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues  

Our revenue was $120,554 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily
due to licensing fee revenue of $104,760 for 2016. 

Operating Expenses  

Direct costs of revenues were $25,265 and
$41,309 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in direct costs of revenues, as a percent
of revenue, was primarily due to licensing fee revenue. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 our general and administrative expenses and marketing and selling expenses were $451,671 compared to $113,316 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in an increase of $338,355, contributable primarily to stock-based compensation of $256,900.
As a result, net loss was $401,892 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net loss of $144,166 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Overview  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
$2,999 in cash. We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate our business. We expect to incur a minimum of $50,000 in expenses
during the next twelve months of operations. We estimate that these expenses will be comprised primarily of general expenses including
overhead, legal and accounting fees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   

We used cash in operations of $21,878 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash used in operations of $76,861 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The negative cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to the Company's
net loss from operations of $401,892 primarily due to the issuance of common stock for services. Cash provided by operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 is attributable to the Company's net loss of $144,166 offset primarily by increase in
prepaid expenses offset by increase in accounts payable to related parties. 

We used cash in investing or financing
activities of $850 and $1,230 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We had cash provided by financing activities
of $23,968 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $81,000 for the same period in 2015. 

We will have to raise funds to pay for
our expenses. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with
a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no arrangements or
understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since we have no such
arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for our operations will have a severe negative impact on
our ability to remain a viable company. 

Going Concern  

The Company has generated limited revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $120,554, has recurring net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
of $401,892, and a working capital deficiency as of September 30, 2016 of $296,322, and used cash in operations of $21,878 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had a stockholders  deficit
and accumulated deficit of $407,352 and $4,412,230, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue
its operations is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt
and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If
the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to
the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements. 

There can be no assurances that the Company
will be successful in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources to be used for operations. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities
that might be necessary. Based on the Company s current resources, the Company will not be able to continue to operate without
additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations,
the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We currently have no off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates
and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future
conditions. 

See Item 7,  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
in our audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on October
7, 2016, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

Adjusted Net Earnings 

In addition to reporting net loss from
operations as defined under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the Company presents adjusted net earnings
from operations (adjusted net earnings), which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Adjusted net earnings consist of net loss from
operations after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. Adjusted net earnings does not represent, and should not
be considered an alternative to, GAAP measurements such as net loss from operations (its most comparable GAAP financial measure),
and the Company s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. By
eliminating the items shown below, the Company believes that the measure is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently
used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies. The Company s management
does not view adjusted net earnings in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as net loss from operation and revenues
to measure operating performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss from operations, the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented: 

Adjusted EBITDA 

In addition to reporting net loss from
operations as defined under GAAP, the Company also presents adjusted net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
depletion, and amortization from operations (adjusted EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists
of net loss from operations after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and
should not be considered an alternative to, GAAP measurements such as net loss from operations (its most comparable GAAP financial
measure), and the Company s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

By eliminating the items shown below, the
Company believes the measure is useful in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance. The Company also believes that
adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other
interested parties in their evaluation of companies. The Company s management uses adjusted EBITDA to manage its business,
including in preparing its annual operating budget and financial projections. The Company s management does not view adjusted
EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as net loss from operations and revenues to measure operating performance.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted
EBITDA for the periods presented: 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation
S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Securities and Exchange Commission
defines the term  disclosure controls and procedures  to mean a company's controls and other procedures of an issuer
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its chief executive and chief financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to
disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the chief executive and interim chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that
the Company continues to have the following deficiencies which represent a material weakness: 

1.  
      The Company intends to appoint additional independent directors;   
 
      2.  
      Lack of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;   
 
      3.  
      Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting;   
 
      4.  
      Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.   

To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends
to implement the following measures: 

The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint additional member(s) to the Audit Committee.   

The Company will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.   

The Company will hire staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting.   

Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures.   

The additional hiring is contingent upon
The Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results of its operations. Management expects
to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Except as set forth above, due to the new
business plan, we are in the process of finalizing our controls over the new business process. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of
Controls  

The Company s management, including
the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must
reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls
is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness
to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

There are no pending legal proceedings
in which we are a party or in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, any owner of record or beneficiary of more than
5% of any class of our voting securities is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us. Our property is not
the subject of any pending legal proceedings. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds  

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the following
issuances of unregistered securities were made. These securities were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the  Securities Act ), but were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.

In connection with
