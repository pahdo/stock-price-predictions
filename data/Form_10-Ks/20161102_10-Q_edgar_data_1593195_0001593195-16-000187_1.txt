CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the information contained in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are based largely on our current expectations and reflect various estimates and assumptions by us.  Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.  Such risks, trends and uncertainties, which in some instances are beyond our control, include:  competition and other economic conditions including fragmentation of the media landscape and competition from other media alternatives; changes in advertising demand, circulation levels and audience shares; our ability to develop and grow our online businesses; our success in implementing expense mitigation efforts; our success in implementing our strategic and branding initiatives; our reliance on revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications; changes in newsprint prices; macroeconomic trends and conditions; our ability to adapt to technological changes; our ability to realize benefits or synergies from acquisitions or divestitures or to operate our businesses effectively following acquisitions or divestitures; our reliance on third-party vendors for various services; adverse results from litigation, such as the stockholder derivative lawsuits, governmental investigations or tax-related proceedings or audits; our ability to attract, integrate and retain our senior management team and employees; our ability to satisfy pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations; changes in accounting standards; the effect of labor strikes, lockouts and labor negotiations; regulatory and judicial rulings; our indebtedness and ability to comply with debt covenants applicable to our debt facilities; our ability to satisfy future capital and liquidity requirements; our ability to access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms; and other events beyond our control that may result in unexpected adverse operating results.  For more information about these and other risks, see  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2016, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 5, 2016. 
  The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   could,   should,   intend,   may,   will,   plan,   seek  and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements.  However, such words are not the exclusive means for identifying forward-looking statements, and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward looking.  Whether or not any such forward-looking statements are, in fact, achieved will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are being made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

NOTE   1  : DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Description of Business   tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing Company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  tronc ) comprise a diversified media and marketing-solutions company that delivers innovative experiences for audiences and advertisers across all platforms.  The Company s diverse portfolio of iconic news and information brands includes   11   award-winning major daily titles, more than   60   digital properties and more than   180   verticals in markets including Los Angeles and San Diego, Ca.; Chicago, Il.; South Florida; Orlando, Fl.; Baltimore, Carroll County and Annapolis, Md.; Hartford, Ct.; Allentown, Pa., and Newport News, Va.  tronc also offers an array of customized marketing solutions, and operates a number of niche products, including   Hoy   and   El Sentinel  , making tronc the country s largest Spanish-language publisher. 
  Fiscal Periods   The Company s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.  Fiscal year 2016 ends on December 25, 2016 and fiscal year 2015 ended on December 27, 2015; both fiscal years are 52-week years with 13 weeks in each quarter. 
  Basis of Presentation   T  he accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (   U.S.   GAAP   ).    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of tronc as of   September 25, 2016   and December 27, 2015, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   and the cash flows for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  .  This includes all normal and recurring adjustments and elimination of intercompany transactions.  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications.  The year-end Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 
  The Company   assesses its operating segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280,    Segment Reporting.     In the three months ended June 26, 2016, the Company realigned under its new management team into two distinct segments, troncM and troncX.  troncM is comprised of the Company s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when sold with a print subscription.  troncX includes the Company s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, as well as Tribune Content Agency ( TCA ) and Forsalebyowner.com ( FSBO ).  The segregation of the digital business in troncX triggered an evaluation of the Company s operating and reportable segments in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.    Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc was managed by its chief operating decision maker, as defined by ASC Topic 280, as   one   business and   one   reportable segment.  Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc began managing its business as   two   distinct segments and, accordingly, has revised its segment reporting to   two   reportable segments.  The prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.  See Note 17 for additional segment information. 
  New Accounting Standards   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Topic 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating how the adoption of this standard will impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Topic 718,   Compensation Stock Compensation  .  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.  ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.  The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing how the adoption of this standard will impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

TRONC, INC. 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Topic 842,   Leases  .  This standard will require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases.  This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Topic 330,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.    This ASU requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which consists of the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.  This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The guidance is to be applied prospectively.  The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this standard had no effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract.  This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted the standard as of the first quarter of 2016 and is applying the standard prospectively.  The adoption of this standard had no effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively.  The new standard supersedes a majority of existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, and requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled.  Companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates while recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures to the financial statements.  ASU 2014-09 allows for either a  full retrospective  adoption or a  modified retrospective  adoption.  The amended effective date of ASU 2014-09 is for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Companies are permitted to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date which was reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company expects to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the revenue recognition impact this guidance will have once implemented and the implementation approach to be used. 
   
  NOTE 2: PROCEEDINGS UNDER CHAPTER 11  
  Chapter 11 Reorganization   On December 8, 2008, Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company ( TCO ) and   110   of its direct and indirect   wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a  Debtor  and, collectively, the  Debtors ), filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ).  A joint plan of reorganization for the Debtors (the  Plan ) became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012 (the  Effective Date ).  Certain of the legal entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of tronc were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken pursuant to the Plan, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors (collectively, the  tronc Debtors ).  
  On April 12, 2012, the Debtors and the official committee of unsecured creditors and creditors under certain TCO prepetition debt facilities filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court.  On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Confirmation Order.  Several notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order were filed.  The appellants sought, among other relief, to overturn the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, including the settlement of certain claims and causes of action related to the Leveraged ESOP Transactions that was embodied in the Plan.  There is currently no stay of the Confirmation Order in place pending resolution of the confirmation-related appeals.  In January 2013, TCO filed a motion before the Delaware District Court to dismiss the appeals as equitably moot, based on the substantial consummation of the Plan.  On June 18, 2014, the Delaware District Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss.  On July 16, 2014, notices of appeal of the Delaware District Court s order were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by Aurelius, Law Debenture, and Deutsche Bank.  On August 19, 2015, the Third Circuit affirmed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Aurelius s appeal of the Confirmation Order.  The

Third Circuit, however, reversed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Law Debenture s and Deutsche Bank s appeals of the Confirmation Order, and remanded those appeals for further proceedings on the merits.  On September 11, 2015, the Third Circuit denied Aurelius s petition for en banc review of the court s decision and on January 11, 2016, Aurelius filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  That petition was denied on March 31, 2016. 
  Prior to December 27, 2015, the Chapter 11 estates of   96   of the Debtors were closed by a final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court.  On May 11, 2016, the Chapter 11 estates of   8   more of the Debtors were closed by a final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court.  On August 12, 2016, the Chapter 11 estates of   2   more of the Debtors, including the last   one   of the tronc Debtors  cases, were closed by a final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court.  The remaining Chapter 11 cases relate to Debtors and successor legal entities that are subsidiaries of TCO and the cases continue to be administered under the caption  In re: Tribune Media Company, et al.,  Case No 08-13141. 
  Reorganization Items, Net   Reorganization items, net, generally includes provisions and adjustments to reflect the carrying value of certain prepetition liabilities at their estimated allowable claim amounts and, pursuant to ASC Topic 852,    Reorganizations,    is reported separately in the Company s   Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)  .  Reorganization items, net, may also include professional advisory fees and other costs directly associated with the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases. 
  Specifically identifiable reorganization provisions, adjustments and other costs directly related to the Company have been included in the Company s   Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)   for the three and   nine months ended September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   and consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The Company expects to incur certain expenses pertaining to the resolution of an unresolved claim in the Chapter 11 proceedings throughout 2016 and potentially in future periods. 
   
  NOTE 3: CHANGES IN OPERATIONS  
  Employee Reductions   In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered an Employee Voluntary Separation Program (     EVSP     ), which provided enhanced separation benefits to eligible non-union employees with more than   one year   of service.  The Company is funding the EVSP ratably over the payout period through salary continuation instead of lump sum severance payments.  The salary continuation started in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continues through the first half of 2018.  For the three and nine months ended   September 25, 2016  , the Company recorded an additional charge of   $0.8 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively, for related severance, benefits and taxes in connection with the EVSP.   
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company began the process to outsource its information technology function ( ITO ).  The Company recorded a pretax charge of   $1.5 million   and   $4.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 25, 2016  , respectively, for severance, benefits and taxes in connection with the ITO, and expects a total estimated cost of   $7.0 million  . 
  In addition to the ITO, the Company implemented additional reductions of   56   and   168   positions in the three and   nine months ended September 25, 2016  , respectively, and recorded a pretax charge related to these reductions and executive separations of   $1.5 million   and   $10.4 million  , respectively.   
  The Company identified reductions in its staffing levels of   24   and   298   in the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , respectively.  The Company recorded pretax charges related to these reductions of   $2.8 million   and   $6.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , respectively.

Manchester and Douglas W. Manchester, and MLIM, as amended effective May 21, 2015.  As of the closing of the transaction, the Company acquired   100%   of the equity interests in MLIM.  The results of operations of   The San Diego Union-Tribune   have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the closing date of the acquisition.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon fair values.  The inputs for fair value are level 3.  The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been completed and the final allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands): 

During the second quarter 2016, the Company completed the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and liabilities.  As a result, the fair value for the intangible assets for subscriber relationships was increased by   $8.0 million   from the original value of   $9.3 million   to   $17.3 million  .  A corresponding decrease in goodwill was also recorded, adjusting goodwill from the original value of   $82.3 million   to   $74.3 million  .  The cumulative impact of the change on amortization expense is not material.

  NOTE 7: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other  ( ASC Topic 350 ), the Company conducts an annual impairment review of its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter.  The impairment review includes a comparison of estimated fair values to book values at the reporting unit level and must be performed annually or more frequently if significant changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that an asset might be impaired.   
  During the second quarter 2016, the Company realigned under its new management team into   two   distinct segments: troncM and troncX.  As part of the re-segmentation, the Company determined that the   nine   media groups and the   four   digital businesses are the reporting units at which goodwill will be evaluated.  See Note   17   for additional segment information. 
  The re-segmentation of the digital business in troncX is considered a triggering event and as part of the re-segmentation, in the second quarter of 2016, the Company performed an interim assessment of the carrying value of its individual ASC Topic 350 reporting units as of immediately before and immediately after the re-segmentation.  T  he calculated fair value was determined using an average of the discounted cash flow method and the market comparable method, applying equal weight to both.  The calculated fair value uses level 3 inputs.  Estimates of fair value are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and are made at a specific point in time.  Thus, changes in key assumptions from period to period could significantly affect the estimates of fair value.  Significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates include projected revenues and related growth rates over time (the perpetuity growth rates used ranged from   (0.3)%   to   2.5%  ), forecasted revenue growth rates (forecasted revenue growth ranged from (  4.4%  ) to   3.3%  ), projected operating cash flow margins, estimated tax rates, depreciation expense, capital expenditures, required working capital needs, and an appropriate risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (the weighted average cost of capital used for troncM was   10.0%   and for troncX was   12.0%  ). 
  Based on the assessments performed, the estimated fair value of all of the Company s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts.

The effective tax rate on pretax income was   42.5%   and   51.0%   in the three and   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , respectively.  During the three months ended June 28, 2015, the Company increased the estimated deferred tax rate on net deferred tax assets from   39.5%   to   40.0%  , which resulted in a decrease in the current period income tax expense of   $0.5 million  .  For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2015, the rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, nondeductible expenses and the domestic production activities deduction, as well as the above described change in the deferred tax rate that was applied to non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities.

  Merrick Media, LLC 
  On February 3, 2016, the Company completed a   $44.4 million   private placement, pursuant to which the Company sold to Merrick Media, LLC ( Merrick Media )   5,220,000   shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of   $8.50   per share.  The Company intends to use the   $42.9 million   net proceeds from the sale to execute further on its growth strategy, including acquisitions and digital initiatives.  The shares of common stock acquired by Merrick Media (the  Merrick Shares ) are subject to certain lockup provisions that, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the purchase agreement dated February 3, 2016 among the Company, Merrick Media and Mr. Ferro (the  Merrick Purchase Agreement ), prohibit certain transfers of the Merrick Shares for the first   three   years following the date of issuance and, thereafter, any transfers of the Merrick Shares that would result in a transfer of more than   25%   of the Merrick Shares purchased under the Merrick

Purchase Agreement in any 12-month period.  The Merrick Purchase Agreement also includes covenants prohibiting the transfer of the Merrick Shares if the transfer would result in a person beneficially owning more than   4.9%   of the Company s then-outstanding shares of common stock following the transfer, as well as transfers to a material competitor of the Company in any of the then-existing primary geographical markets.  Merrick Media and Mr. Ferro and their respective affiliates, are also prohibited from acquiring additional equity if the acquisition could result in their beneficial ownership of more than   25%   of the Company s then-outstanding shares of common stock. 
   In connection with the private placement, Mr. Ferro was elected to fill a newly-created position on the Company s Board of Directors and was named non-executive Chairman of the Board.  The Company granted Merrick Media the right to designate a replacement individual for election as a director at each annual and special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected as part of the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors, subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Board s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in the event that Mr. Ferro is unable to continue to serve as a director.  Merrick Media s right to appoint a replacement director representative will expire either (a) on the date that Mr. Ferro or his replacement is not nominated for reelection as a director, is removed as a director, or is not reelected as a director if the Company has not recommended his or his replacement s reelection or (b) at such time as Merrick Media, Mr. Ferro and their respective affiliates no longer beneficially own at least   75%   of the shares originally acquired pursuant to the Merrick Purchase Agreement. 
  Additionally, in connection with the private placement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Merrick Rights Agreement ) with Merrick Media.  Pursuant to the Merrick Rights Agreement, Merrick Media will be entitled to certain registration rights under the Securities Act, with respect to the Merrick Shares.  The Merrick Rights Agreement provides that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause a registration statement with respect to the Merrick Shares to be declared effective no later than the earlier of (a)   three years   after the consummation of the private placement transaction contemplated by the Merrick Purchase Agreement and (b)   60 days   after the termination of the voting covenants of the Merrick Purchase Agreement as described above.  The Company will pay all of its own costs and expenses, including all fees and expenses of counsel for the Company, relating to the Merrick Rights Agreement. 
  Mr. Ferro is the manager of Merrick Venture Management, LLC, which is the sole manager of Merrick Media.  Because Merrick Venture Management, LLC serves as the sole manager of Merrick Media, Mr. Ferro may be deemed to indirectly control all of the shares of the Company s common stock owned by Merrick Media. 
  Dividends 
  On February 11, 2016, the Company paid a dividend of   $0.175   per share on common stock outstanding, to stockholders of record on January 11, 2016.  In February 2016, the Company s Board of Directors suspended the payment of cash dividends on the Company s outstanding common stock.  Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors, after taking into account the Company s financial results, capital requirements and other factors it may deem relevant. 
  Name Change and Stock Exchange Listing 
  The Company transferred its stock exchange listing from the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) to The Nasdaq Global Select Market ( Nasdaq ) and changed its corporate name to tronc, Inc.

  Stockholder Derivative Lawsuits 
  On June 1, 2016, Capital Structures Realty Advisors LLC, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the members of the Company s Board of Directors as of June 1, 2016, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital.  The complaint has named the Company as a nominal defendant.  The complaint alleges in relevant part that the Board breached its fiduciary duties by  refusing to negotiate with Gannett in good faith  and by  going forward with the stock sale  to Dr. Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital.  The complaint further alleges that Nant Capital and Dr. Soon-Shiong aided and abetted the Board s breaches of fiduciary duty.  On June 6, 2016, a second derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by Monroe County Employees Retirement System, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company.  On June 15, 2016, a third, mirror image, derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named John Solak, who purports to be a stockholder in the Company.  All   three   cases were consolidated on June 17, 2016, under the caption In re Tribune Publishing Co. Stockholder Litigation, Consolidated C.A. No. 12401-VCS.  On June 20, 2016, a fourth, mirror image derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named B.W. Tomasino, who purports to be a stockholder in the Company.  That case was consolidated with the other   three   derivative cases on July 7, 2016.  The plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief, including, without limitation, rescission of the stock sale to Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital, implementation of a special committee to consider Gannett and any other offer for the Company, money damages, and costs and

disbursements, and such other relief deemed just and proper.  The consolidated case is pending before Vice Chancellor Slights.   
  On September 2, 2016, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint.  The defendants filed motions to dismiss on October 3, 2016.  The defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend vigorously against the lawsuits.  Due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation, however, the Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the matter or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.  Additionally, the Company maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers, which we expect to provide coverage for this litigation; however, there can be no guarantees as to coverage or whether any such policies will be adequate to cover all costs associated with this litigation.

The Company s Board of Directors determined that the price reflected in Gannett s revised proposal was inadequate for a control investment and was not in the best interests of its shareholders and communicated such to Gannett.  Subsequently, the tronc Board, management team and their advisers engaged in substantive discussions and due diligence with Gannett regarding a potential transaction.  The parties agreed to a purchase price in mid-September and subsequently worked to finalize a merger agreement.  On November 1, 2016, the Company was informed that Gannett decided to terminate discussions regarding a potential business combination with tronc.

  OVERVIEW 
  tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing Company,   was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013.  tronc, Inc.,   and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  tronc ) comprise a diversified media and marketing-solutions company that delivers innovative experiences for audiences and advertisers across all platforms.  The Company s diverse portfolio of iconic news and information brands includes 11 award-winning major daily titles, more than 60 digital properties and more than 180 verticals in markets including Los Angeles and San Diego, Ca; Chicago, Il; South Florida; Orlando, Fl; Baltimore, Carroll County and Annapolis, Md.; Hartford, Ct.; Allentown, Pa.; and Newport News, Va. tronc also offers an array of customized marketing solutions, and operates a number of niche products, including   Hoy   and   El Sentinel  , making tronc the country s largest Spanish-language publisher. 
  On August 4, 2014 (the  Distribution Date ), Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company ( TCO )  completed the spin-off of its principal publishing operations into an independent company, Tribune Publishing Company (renamed tronc, Inc.) (the  Distribution ).  In the Distribution, 25,042,263 shares of tronc common stock were distributed to the TCO stockholders and holders of TCO warrants and TCO retained 381,354 shares of tronc common stock, representing 1.5% of outstanding common stock of tronc.  Subsequent to the Distribution, tronc became a separate publicly-traded company with its own board of directors and senior management team. 
  2016 Highlights and Recent Events 
             
    On February 3, 2016, the Company completed a $44.4 million private placement of the Company s common stock to Merrick Media, LLC ( Merrick Media ). 
                
    In February 2016, Homefinder.com LLC ( Homefinder ) sold substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities, excluding cash, to Placester, Inc. ( Placester ) for cash and stock representing 0.75% of outstanding Placester stock. 
                
    In March 2016, Contend, LLC ( Contend ) exercised its option to repurchase its Class A units from the Company.  The Company received   $1.2 million   for the units and recorded a gain of   $0.4 million   on the transaction.  
                
    On June 1, 2016, the Company completed a $70.5 million private placement of the Company s common stock to Nant Capital, LLC ( Nant Capital ). 
     Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc began managing its business as two distinct segments  , troncM and troncX.  troncM is comprised of the Company s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when sold with a print subscription.  troncX includes the Company s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, as well as Tribune Content Agency ( TCA ) and Forsalebyowner.com ( FSBO ).    Accordingly, the Company changed its segment reporting to   two   reportable segments.  The prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.  Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc was managed by its chief operating decision maker, as defined by ASC Topic 280, as   one   business and   one   reportable segment.   
  
   27 

troncM 
  troncM s media groups include the Chicago Tribune Media Group, the Los Angeles Times Media Group, the San Diego Media Group, the Sun Sentinel Media Group, the Orlando Sentinel Media Group, The Baltimore Sun Media Group, the Hartford Courant Media Group, the Morning Call Media Group and the Daily Press Media Group.  In May 2015, the Company   acquired   The San Diego Union-Tribune   newspaper (f/k/a the   U-T San Diego  ) and nine community weeklies.  
  In the   nine months ended September 25, 2016  ,   48.8%   of troncM s operating revenues were derived from advertising.  These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers and from the delivery of preprinted advertising supplements.  Approximately   35.3%   of operating revenues for the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   were generated from the sale of newspapers and other publications to individual subscribers or to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers.  The remaining   15.9%   of operating revenues for the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   were generated from the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services, and other related activities. 
  Newspaper print advertising is typically in the form of display, classified or preprint advertising.  Advertising and marketing services revenues are comprised of three basic categories: retail, national and classified.  Retail is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with the general public.  National is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with other businesses.  Classified is a type of advertising which is other than display or preprint. 
  Circulation revenue results from the sale of print editions of newspapers to individual subscribers and the sale of print editions of newspapers to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers.  
  Other revenues are derived from commercial printing and delivery services provided to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities.    The Company contracts with a number of national and local newspapers to both print and distribute their respective publications in local markets where it is a newspaper publisher.  In some instances where it prints publications, it also manages and procures newsprint, ink and plates on their behalf.  These arrangements allow the Company to leverage its investment in infrastructure in those markets that support its own publications.  As a result, these arrangements tend to contribute incremental profitability and revenues.  The Company currently distributes national newspapers (including   The New York Times  ,   USA Today  , and   The Wall Street     Journal  ) in its local markets under multiple agreements.  Additionally, in Los Angeles and Chicago the Company provides some or all of these services to other local publications. 
  Products and Services 
  Our product mix consists of three publication types: (i) daily newspapers, (ii) weekly newspapers and (iii) niche publications.  The key characteristics of each of these types of publications are summarized in the table below.

  Subsequent Event 
  In April 2016, the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Gannett Co., Inc. to acquire all outstanding shares of the Company common stock for $12.25 per share in cash which was revised in May 2016 to   $15   per share in cash with both proposals being subject to satisfactory due diligence by Gannett.  The Company s Board of Directors determined that the price reflected in Gannett s revised proposal was inadequate for a control investment and was not in the best interests of its shareholders and communicated such to Gannett. Subsequently, the tronc Board, management team and their advisers engaged in substantive discussions and due diligence with Gannett regarding a potential transaction.  The parties agreed to a purchase price in mid-September and subsequently worked to finalize a merger agreement.  On November 1, 2016, the Company was informed that Gannett decided to terminate discussions regarding a potential business combination with tronc. 
   
  Chapter 11 Reorganization 
  On December 8, 2008 (the      Petition Date   )  , TCO and   110   of its direct and indirect   wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a  Debtor  and, collectively, the  Debtors ), filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ).  A joint plan of reorganization for the Debtors (the  Plan ) became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on December 31, 2012 (the  Effective Date ).

Prior to December 27, 2015, the Chapter 11 estates of 96 of the Debtors have been closed by a final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court.  On May 11, 2016, the Chapter 11 estates of   8   of the Debtors were closed by a final decree issued by the Bankruptcy Court.  On August 12, 2016, the Chapter 11 estates of   2   more of the Debtors, including the last   one   of the tronc Debtors  cases, were closed by a final decree issued by the  
  
   30 

Bankruptcy Court.  The remaining Chapter 11 cases relate to Debtors and successor legal entities that are subsidiaries of TCO and the cases continue to be administered under the caption  In re: Tribune Media Company, et al.,  Case No 08-13141.

  Compensation Expense   Compensation expense   decreased     10.8%  , or   $17.0 million  , in the   three months ended September 25, 2016   due primarily to a decrease in salary expense of $17.4 million as a result of the reduction in headcount in the last quarter of 2015 related to the employee voluntary severance program ( EVSP ), and a decrease in payroll tax expense and 401(k) contributions of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $2.1 million compared to the prior year quarter. 
  Newsprint and Ink Expense   Newsprint and ink expense declined   13.7%  , or   $4.0 million  , in the   three months ended September 25, 2016   due mainly to a 6.3% increase in the average cost per ton of newsprint and a 14.3% decrease in consumption.

  Income Tax Expense (Benefit)   Income tax expense increased   $10.7 million   for the three month period ended   September 25, 2016   over the prior year period primarily due to a $7.1 million charge to adjust the Company s deferred taxes and a decrease in the Company s pre-tax loss.  See Note 10 for further explanation of the charge. 
  The effective tax rate on pretax income was   (71.1%)   in the three months ended   September 25, 2016  .  This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, a charge to adjust the Company s deferred taxes and nondeductible expenses.

The effective tax rate on pretax income was   42.5%   in the three months ended   September 27, 2015  .

   32 

Newsprint and Ink Expense   Newsprint and ink expense declined   16.0%  , or   $14.7 million  , in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   due mainly to a 2.9% decrease in the average cost per ton of newsprint and a 12.1% decrease in consumption, partially offset by consumption from acquisitions.  
  Outside Services Expense   Outside services expense   decreased     1.2%  , or   $4.6 million  , in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   due primarily to decreases in production and distribution expenses partially offset by increases in temporary help expenses. 
  Other Expenses   Other expenses   decreased     2.0%  , or   $4.7 million  , in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   due primarily to a decrease relating to a prior year litigation matter offset by increases in occupancy costs related to the permanently vacated leased space discussed above. 
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense   Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $2.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016  , due primarily to depreciation on prior year fixed asset additions and amortization related to acquisition assets.

  Interest Expense, Net   Interest expense, net increased   $1.0 million   for the nine month period ended   September 25, 2016  , over the prior year period.    The increase in interest expense is due to the $70 million additional borrowing under the Senior Term Facility in May 2015 related to the acquisition of   The San Diego Union-Tribune  .  
  Income Tax Expense (Benefit)   Income tax expense increased   $6.1 million   for the nine month period ended   September 25, 2016   over the prior year period primarily due to a $7.1 million charge to adjust the Company s deferred taxes offset by an increase in the Company s pre-tax loss.  See Note 10 for further explanation of the charge. 
  The effective tax rate on pretax income was   (34.5)%   in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016  .  This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, a charge to adjust the Company s deferred taxes, non-deductible expenses and the domestic production activities deduction.  For the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax benefit of   $2.8 million  .  The effective tax rate on pretax income was   51.0%   in the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  .  This rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, nondeductible expenses and the domestic production activities deduction.  Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , the Company increased the estimated deferred tax rate on net deferred tax assets from 39.5% to 40.0% which resulted in a decrease in the prior period income tax expense of $0.5 million. 
   
  Segments 
  Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc began managing its business as   two distinct segments, troncM and troncX.  troncM is comprised of the Company s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when sold with a print subscription.  troncX includes the Company s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local websites and mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, as well as Tribune Content Agency ( TCA ) and Forsalebyowner.com ( FSBO ).    Accordingly, the Company changed its segment reporting to   two   reportable segments.  The prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.  Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, tronc was managed by its chief operating decision maker, as defined by ASC Topic 280, as   one   business and   one   reportable segment.   
  The Company measures segment profit using income from operations, which is defined as net income before net interest expense, gain on investment transactions, reorganization items and income taxes.

Non-GAAP Measures 
  Adjusted EBITDA   The Company defines   Adjusted EBITDA as net income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, income taxes, loss on early debt extinguishment, interest expense, other (expense) income, realized gain (loss) on investments, reorganization items, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and other items that the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance.  These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance (including spin-related costs). 

* Represents positive or negative change in excess of 100% 
           (1) -  
    Restructuring and transaction costs include costs related to tronc s internal restructuring, such as severance and IT outsourcing costs, charges associated with vacated space and transaction costs related to completed and potential acquisitions. 
              (2) - 
    In the first quarter of 2015, the Company did not deduct a gain of $7.8 million related to the termination of certain postretirement benefits in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA.  Management reassessed this gain and determined it is expected to be a non-recurring item and should be deducted in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA.  Accordingly, the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA as presented, includes such adjustment for the non-recurring gain from termination of certain post-retirement benefits.  
              (3) - 
    Adjustment to litigation settlement reserve. 
     Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company s core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period.  The Company s management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company s Board of Directors concerning the Company s financial performance.      In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, is used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company is subject to in connection with certain credit facilities.  Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company s financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business. 
  
   37 

Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are:  
             
    they do not reflect the Company s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company s debt;   
                
    they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and 
                
    although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
      
  Liquidity   and Capital Resources 
  The Company believes that its working capital, future cash from operations and access to borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility discussed below will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future.  The Company s access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including its credit rating, the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy.  There can be no assurances that the Company will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms. 
  Sources and Uses 
  The Company expects to fund capital expenditures, interest and principal and pension payments due in 2016 and other operating requirements through a combination of existing cash and cash flows from operations and investments.  The Company also has available borrowing capacity under the Company s revolving credit facility.  The Company s financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and, despite the Company s current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, future borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and any refinancings thereof, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Company s future liquidity needs. 
  The table below details the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows for the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   (in thousands): 

Cash flow generated from operating activities is tronc s primary source of liquidity.  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $55.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 25, 2016  , down   $5.9 million   from   $61.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily driven by lower operating results in 2016 and higher pension contributions in 2016 partially offset by favorable changes in working capital.  
  Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $0.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016   and included   $1.3 million   used to purchase domain names including LA.com and   $15.9 million   used for capital expenditures, partially offset by   $17.0 million   provided by a reduction in restricted cash and   $1.2 million   provided by a sale of the Company s interest in Contend.  In the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , net cash used for investing activities totaled   $85.6 million   and included   $67.8 million   for the acquisition of   The   San Diego Union-Tribune   and     $27.5 million   for capital expenditures, partially offset by   $10.5 million   provided by a reduction in restricted cash. 
  
   38 

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $91.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 25, 2016  .  During the period the Company had net proceeds of   $113.3 million   from the private placement of 9.9 million shares of common stock, partially offset by   $15.8 million   used for principal payments on senior debt and   $4.9 million   used for payment of stockholder dividends.  In the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $42.2 million   which included proceeds from the issuance of senior debt of   $69.0 million  , partially offset by   $14.4 million   in loan payments on senior debt,   $9.1 million   paid for stockholder dividends and   $2.7 million   paid for financing costs related to the issuance of senior debt.

Ferro, Jr. (the  Merrick Purchase Agreement ), prohibit certain transfers of the Merrick Shares for the first three years following the date of issuance and, thereafter, any transfers of the Merrick Shares that would result in a transfer of more than 25% of the Merrick Shares purchased under the Merrick Purchase Agreement in any 12-month period.  The Merrick Purchase Agreement also includes covenants prohibiting the transfer of the Merrick Shares if the transfer would result in a person beneficially owning more than 4.9% of the Company s then-outstanding shares of common stock following the transfer, as well as transfers to a material competitor of the Company in any of the then-existing primary geographical markets.  Merrick Media and Mr. Ferro and their respective affiliates, are also prohibited from acquiring additional equity if the acquisition could result in their beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the Company s then-outstanding shares of common stock. 
   In connection with the private placement, Mr. Ferro was elected to fill a newly-created position on the Company s Board of Directors and was named non-executive Chairman of the Board.  The Company granted Merrick Media the right to designate a replacement individual for election as a director at each annual and special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected as part of the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors, subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Board s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in the event that Mr. Ferro is unable to continue to serve as a director.

Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors, after taking into account the Company s financial results, capital requirements and other factors it may deem relevant. 
  Employee Reductions 
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered the EVSP, which provided enhanced separation benefits to eligible non-union employees with more than one year of service.  The Company is funding the EVSP ratably over the payout period through salary continuation instead of lump sum severance payments.  The salary continuation started in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continues through the first half of 2018.  For the three and nine months ended   September 25, 2016  , the Company recorded an additional charge of   $0.8 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively, for related severance, benefits and taxes in connection with the EVSP.

  As of   September 25, 2016  , total principal outstanding under the secured loans (the  Term Loans ) provided for by the credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto dated August 4, 2014 (the  Senior Term Facility ) was   $384.9 million  .  The Term Loans bear interest at a variable interest rate based on either LIBOR or a base rate, in either case plus an applicable margin.  The Term Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments equal to   1.25%   of principal amounts borrowed against the Senior Term Facility with the balance payable on the maturity date, August 4, 2021.  tronc, Inc, is the borrower under the Senior Term Facility and each of the Company s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ), guarantee the payment obligations under the Senior Term Facility.  The Senior Term Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of tronc and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur more indebtedness; pay dividends; redeem stock or make other distributions in respect of equity; make investments; and certain other usual and customary covenants.  The weighted average interest rate for the variable rate debt is 5.75%.  As of   September 25, 2016  , the unamortized balance of the original issue discount was   $3.3 million   and the unamortized balance of the debt issuance costs associated with the term loans was   $7.9 million  .  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Term Facility. 
  Senior ABL Facility 
  The credit agreement between the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the lenders party thereto dated August 4, 2014 (the  Senior ABL Facility ) provides for senior secured revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $140.0 million  .  Up to   $75.0 million   of availability under the Senior ABL Facility is available for letters of credit and up to   $15.0 million   of availability under the Senior ABL Facility is available for swing line loans.  The Senior ABL Facility also permits tronc to increase the commitments under the Senior ABL Facility by up to   $75.0 million  .  The Senior ABL Facility bears interest at a variable interest rate based on either LIBOR or a base rate, in either case plus an applicable margin and will mature on  
  
   40 

August 4, 2019.  tronc, Inc. and the Subsidiary Guarantors are the borrowers under the Senior ABL Facility.  tronc, Inc. and the Subsidiary Guarantors guarantee the payment obligations under the Senior ABL Facility.  The Senior ABL Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of tronc and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur more indebtedness; pay dividends; redeem stock or make other distributions in respect of equity; make investments; and certain other usual and customary covenants.  Customary fees are payable in respect of the Senior ABL Facility, including commitment fees of   0.25%   and letter of credit fees.  As of   September 25, 2016  , there were no borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility and   $40.5 million   of the Senior ABL Facility availability supported outstanding undrawn letters of credit in the same amount.  
  Letter of Credit Agreement 
  On August 4, 2014, tronc, formerly Tribune Publishing Company, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as letter of credit issuer (the  L/C Issuer ) entered into a letter of credit agreement (the  Letter of Credit Agreement ).  The Letter of Credit Agreement provides for the issuance of standby letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal face of   $30.0 million  .  The Letter of Credit Agreement permits tronc, at the sole discretion of L/C Issuer, to request an increase of the amount available to be issued under the Letter of Credit Agreement up to an aggregate maximum face amount of   $50.0 million  .  The Letter of Credit Agreement is scheduled to terminate on August 4, 2019.  During the quarter ended September 27, 2015, the Company was notified that an outstanding letter of credit agreement was reduced from $27.5 million to $17.0 million.  Accordingly, the Company received $10.5 million from the cash collateral account during the quarter.  During the quarter ended September 25, 2016, the Company closed its letter of credit for $17.0 million and moved the letter of credit to Bank of America, N.A. under the Senior ABL facility.  This movement allowed for the release of the remaining $17.0 million held as restricted cash.  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company had no outstanding undrawn letters of credit against the Letter of Credit Agreement. 
  New Accounting Standards 
  See Note   1   for a description of new accounting standards issued and/or adopted in the nine months ended   September 25, 2016  . 
   
  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  As of   September 25, 2016  , there had been no material changes in the Company s exposure to market risk from the disclosure included in the annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016. 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company carried out an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the     Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 25, 2016, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2015 (the  Management Internal Controls Report ), the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
  Notwithstanding the material weaknesses noted above, the Company s principal executive officer and the principal financial officer have certified that, based on their knowledge, the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the period ends, and for each of the periods presented in this report. 
  During the nine months ended September 25, 2016, except as discussed below and pertaining to the remediation of identified material weaknesses, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   41 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  In response to the identified material weaknesses, management has identified several enhancements to the Company s internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses discussed in the Management Internal Controls Report.  These ongoing efforts include the following: 
             
    appointment of an executive over the Corporate Compliance function to assist management in its efforts related to effective control design, documentation and implementation, as well as remediate ineffective controls; 
                
    enhancement of the documentation process for our preprint advertising forecasting; 
                
    the Company has formalized the process for single copy rate changes to ensure compliance with contractual rates and maintenance of supporting documentation and has enhanced processes to ensure supporting documentation for all circulation rate changes is properly maintained; 
                
    modification of the Company s processes and controls over advertising insert variance analyses to ensure the appropriate controls are in place to address the associated risks; 
                
    streamlining the Company s commission and sales bonus plans to limit the number of different plans and enhance control thereof, as well as implementation of a more robust sales and commission calculation, authorization and monitoring process, incorporating increased automation and eliminating many manual processes;  
                
    implementation of a more controlled repository for retaining control execution evidence; and 
                
    providing training and guidance throughout the year to re-educate control owners about control owner accountability and retaining required supporting control documentation. 
     Although management believes the Company has made improvements in these areas, additional efforts are underway to ensure remediation of the material weaknesses.  Accordingly, the Company will  continue to enhance overall monitoring of SOX compliance throughout the organization and more effectively integrate the controls into the day-to-day business operations while ensuring the associated risks are appropriately mitigated. 
  In addition, under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, management will continue to develop and implement policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Management believes the foregoing efforts will ensure effective remediation of the material weaknesses.  As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine additional measures are necessary to address control deficiencies or determine that it is necessary to modify the remediation plan described above.  Management cannot provide assurance as to when the Company will remediate such weaknesses, nor can management be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. 
   
  PART II. 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  The legal entities comprising our operations are defendants from time to time in actions for matters arising out of their business operations.  In addition, the legal entities comprising our operations are involved from time to time as parties in various regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. 
  Stockholder Derivative Lawsuits  
  On June 1, 2016, Capital Structures Realty Advisors LLC, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the members of the Company s Board of Directors as of June 1, 2016, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital LLC ( Nant Capital ).  The complaint has named the Company as a nominal defendant.  The complaint alleges in relevant part that the Board breached its fiduciary duties by  refusing to negotiate with Gannett in good faith  and by  going forward with the stock sale  to Dr. Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital.  The complaint further alleges that Nant Capital and Dr. Soon-Shiong aided and abetted the Board s breaches of fiduciary duty.  On June 6, 2016, a second derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by Monroe County Employees Retirement System, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company.  On June 15, 2016, a third, mirror image, derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named John Solak, who purports to be a stockholder in the Company.  All three cases were consolidated on June 17, 2016, under the caption In re Tribune Publishing Co. Stockholder Litigation, Consolidated C.A. No. 12401-VCS.  On June 20, 2016, a fourth, mirror image derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named B.W. Tomasino, who purports to be  
  
   42 

a stockholder in the Company.  That case was consolidated with the other three derivative cases on July 7, 2016.  The plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief, including, without limitation, rescission of the stock sale to Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital, implementation of a special committee to consider Gannett and any other offer for the Company, money damages, and costs and disbursements, and such other relief deemed just and proper.  The consolidated case is pending before Vice Chancellor Slights. 
  On September 2, 2016, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint.  The defendants filed motions to dismiss on October 3, 2016.  The defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend vigorously against the lawsuits.  Due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation, however, the Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the matter or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.  Additionally, the Company maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers, which we expect to provide coverage for this litigation; however, there can be no guarantees as to coverage or whether any such policies will be adequate to cover all costs associated with this litigation.   
  Tribune Company Bankruptcy 
  On December 31, 2012, Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company ( TCO ), and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ) on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) emerged from Chapter 11.  Certain of the legal entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of tronc were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken at the time of the Debtors  emergence, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors.  
  On April 12, 2012, the Debtors, the official committee of unsecured creditors and creditors under certain TCO prepetition debt facilities filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court.  On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Confirmation Order.  Several notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order were filed.  The appellants sought, among other relief, to overturn the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, including the settlement of certain claims and causes of action related to the Leveraged ESOP Transactions that was embodied in the Plan.  There is currently no stay of the Confirmation Order in place pending resolution of the confirmation-related appeals.  In January 2013, TCO filed a motion before the Delaware District Court to dismiss the appeals as equitably moot, based on the substantial consummation of the Plan.  On June 18, 2014 the Delaware District Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss.  On July 16, 2014, notices of appeal of the Delaware District Court s order were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by Aurelius, Law Debenture, and Deutsche Bank.  On August 19, 2015, the Third Circuit affirmed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Aurelius s appeal of the Confirmation Order.  The Third Circuit, however, reversed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Law Debenture s and Deutsche Bank s appeals of the Confirmation Order, and remanded those appeals for further proceedings on the merits.  On September 11, 2015, the Third Circuit denied Aurelius s petition for en banc review of the court s decision and on January 11, 2016, Aurelius filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  That petition was denied on March 31, 2016. 
  On March 16, 2015, July 24, 2015, May 11, 2016, and August 12, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees collectively closing 106 of the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases.  The remaining Debtors  Chapter 11 cases have not yet been closed by the Bankruptcy Court, and certain claims asserted against the Debtors in the Chapter 11 cases remain unresolved.    
  The Company does not believe that any matters or proceedings presently pending will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  However, legal matters and proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.  As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters and proceedings will not materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  In addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the discussion under  Risk Factors  in Item 1A as filed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016 and supplemented in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  There have been no material changes to our risk factors as disclosed in such filings. 
  
   43 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  In August 2015, our Board of Directors authorized $30 million to be used for stock repurchases for 24 months from the date of authorization.  No repurchases were made in the   three months ended September 25, 2016  , and the Company has $28.6 million of remaining authorization under the stock repurchase plan as of   September 25, 2016  . 
   
  Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
  None. 
   
  Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures 
  Not applicable. 
   
  Item 5.  Other Information 
  None. 
   
  Item 6.  Exhibits
