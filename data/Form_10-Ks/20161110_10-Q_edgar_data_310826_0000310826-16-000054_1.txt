1.                                            BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Protective Life Insurance Company (the  Company ), a stock life insurance company, was founded in 1907. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Protective Life Corporation ( PLC ), an insurance holding company. On February 1, 2015, PLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, a   kabushiki kaisha   organized under the laws of Japan ( Dai-ichi Life ), when DL Investment (Delaware), Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life, merged with and into PLC (the  Merger ). Prior to February 1, 2015, and for the periods reported as  predecessor , PLC s stock was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequent to the Merger date, PLC and the Company remain as SEC registrants within the United States. PLC is a holding company with subsidiaries that provide financial services through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and investment products. 
    
  In conjunction with the Merger, the Company elected to apply  pushdown  accounting by applying the guidance allowed by ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , including the initial recognition of most of the Company s assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition date, and similarly recognizing goodwill calculated based on the terms of the transaction and the fair value of the new basis of net assets of the Company. The new basis of accounting will be the basis of the accounting records for assets and liabilities held at the acquisition date in the preparation of future financial statements and related disclosures after the Merger date. 
    
  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for the interim periods presented herein. Such accounting principles differ from statutory reporting practices used by insurance companies in reporting to state regulatory authorities. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 (  Successor Company  ). The year-end consolidated condensed financial data included herein was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP within this report. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ). 
    
  The operating results of companies in the insurance industry have historically been subject to significant fluctuations due to changing competition, economic conditions, interest rates, investment performance, insurance ratings, claims, persistency, and other factors. 
    
  Entities Included 
    
  The consolidated condensed financial statements for the predecessor and successor periods presented in this report include the accounts of Protective Life Insurance Company and its affiliate companies in which the Company holds a majority voting or economic interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

2.                                            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  For a full description of significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ). There were no significant changes to the Company's accounting policies during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted 
    
    Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-02-Consolidation-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   This Update makes several targeted changes to generally accepted accounting principles, including a) eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and b) eliminating the consolidation model specific to limited partnerships. The amendments also clarify when fees and related party relationships should be considered in the consolidation of variable interest entities. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Update did not impact the Company's financial position or results of operations, and the Company has revised its policies and processes to comply with the revised guidance. 
    
    ASU No. 2015-03-Interest-Imputation of Interest.   The objective of this Update is to eliminate diversity in practice related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in this Update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update. The Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires revised presentation of debt issuance costs in all periods presented in the financial statements. The Update did not impact  

Table of Contents  

the Company's financial position or results of operations, and the Company has revised its policies and processes to comply with the revised guidance. 
    
    ASU No. 2015-15 - Interest - Imputation of Interest - Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.   The objective of this Update is to clarify the SEC Staff s position on presenting and measuring debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements given the lack of guidance on the topic in ASU No. 2015-03. This Update reflects the SEC Staff s decision to not object when an entity defers and presents debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The Update did not impact the Company's financial position or results of operations, and the Company has revised its policies and processes to comply with the revised guidance. 
    
    ASU No. 2015-05 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software.   The amendments in this Update provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts. The Update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Update did not impact the Company's financial position or results of operations, and the Company has revised its policies and processes to comply with the new standard. 
    
     Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
    
  ASU No. 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This Update provides for significant revisions to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers across various industries. Under the new guidance, entities are required to apply a prescribed 5-step process to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The accounting for revenues associated with insurance products is not within the scope of this Update. The Update was originally effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 -   Revenues from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date  , to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption will be allowed, but not before the original effective date. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the requirements in this Update, upon adoption, and assessing the impact this standard will have on its non-insurance operations. 
    
    ASU No. 2014-15-Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   This Update will require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and will require footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Under the updated guidance, management should consider relevant conditions and evaluate whether it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date of the financial statements. The Update is effective for annual periods ending December 31, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this Update will not impact the Company s financial position or results of operations. However, the new guidance will require a formal assessment of going concern by management based on criteria prescribed in the new guidance. The Company is prepared to comply with the revised guidance, upon adoption. 
    
    ASU No. 2015-09 - Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts.   The amendments in this Update require additional disclosures for short-duration contracts issued by insurance entities. The additional disclosures focus on the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and include incurred and paid claims development information by accident year in tabular form, along with a reconciliation of this information to the statement of financial position. For accident years included in the development tables, the amendments also require disclosure of the total incurred-but-not-reported liabilities and expected development on reported claims, along with claims frequency information unless impracticable. Finally, the amendments require disclosure of the historical average annual percentage payout of incurred claims. With the exception of the current reporting period, claims development information may be presented as supplementary information. The Update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not anticipate that the additional disclosures introduced in this Update will be material to its financial statements. 
    
    ASU No. 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most notably, the Update requires that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the revised guidance. 
    
    ASU No. 2016-02 - Leases.   The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leases. The most significant change will relate to the accounting model used by lessees. The Update will require all leases with terms greater than 12 months to be recorded on the balance sheet in the form of a lease asset and liability. The amendments in the Update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the revised guidance. 
    
    ASU No. 2016-13 - Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The amendments in this Update introduce a new impairment model for certain financial assets, including mortgage loans and reinsurance receivables. The new model will not apply to debt securities classified as available-for-sale. For assets within the  

Table of Contents  

scope of the new model, an entity will recognize as an allowance its estimate of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected. This differs from the current impairment model, which requires recognition of credit losses when they have been incurred. The Update also makes targeted changes to the current impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, which comprise the majority of the Company s invested assets. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the requirements in this Update, upon adoption, and assessing the impact this standard will have on its operations and financial results. 
    
    ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments in this Update are intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Specific transactions addressed in the new guidance include:     Debt prepayment/extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investments. The Update does not introduce any new accounting or financial reporting requirements, and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the requirements in this Update, upon adoption. 
    
    ASU No. 2016-16 - Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.   The objective of this Update is to reduce complexity and diversity in practice related to certain types of intra-entity asset transfers. Under the revised guidance, entities will be required to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of an assets other than inventory when those transfers occur. The Update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently reviewing the Update to determine whether the amendments will impact its financial position or results of operations, and whether changes are needed to its policies and processes to comply with the revised guidance. 

3.                                            REINSURANCE AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS 
    
  On January 15, 2016, the Company completed the transaction contemplated by the Master Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 (the  Master Agreement ), with Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company ( GLAIC ). Pursuant to the Master Agreement, effective January 1, 2016, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement (the  Reinsurance Agreement ) under the terms of which the Company coinsures certain term life insurance business of GLAIC (the  GLAIC Block ). In connection with the reinsurance transaction, on January 15, 2016, Golden Gate Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Steel City, LLC ( Steel City ), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of PLC, entered into an   18  -year transaction to finance   $2.188 billion   of  XXX  reserves related to the acquired GLAIC Block and the other term life insurance business reinsured to Golden Gate by the Company and West Coast Life Insurance Company ( WCL ), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Steel City issued notes with an aggregate initial principal amount of   $2.188 billion   to Golden Gate in exchange for a surplus note issued by Golden Gate with an initial principal amount of   $2.188 billion  . Through the structure, Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (Bermuda) Ltd., The Canada Life Assurance Company (Barbados Branch) and Nomura Americas Re Ltd. (collectively, the  Risk-Takers ) provide credit enhancement to the Steel City notes for the   18  -year term in exchange for credit enhancement fees. The transaction is  non-recourse  to PLC, WCL and the Company, meaning that none of these companies are liable to reimburse the Risk-Takers for any credit enhancement payments required to be made. In connection with the transaction, PLC has entered into certain support agreements under which it guarantees or otherwise supports certain obligations of Golden Gate or Steel City, including a guarantee of the fees to the Risk-Takers. As a result of the financing transaction described above, the   $800 million   of Golden Gate Series A Surplus Notes held by PLC were contributed to the Company and then subsequently contributed to Golden Gate, which resulted in the extinguishment of these notes. Also on January 15, 2016, Golden Gate paid an extraordinary dividend of   $300 million   to the Company as approved by the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. 
    
  The transactions described above resulted in an increase to total assets and total liabilities of   $2.8 billion  . Of the   $2.8 billion   increase in total assets,   $0.6 billion   was the result of the reinsurance transaction with GLAIC which included a   $280 million   increase in VOBA. The remaining   $2.2 billion   increase to total assets and liabilities is associated with the financing transaction between Golden Gate and Steel City.  
    
  The Company considered whether the Reinsurance Agreement constituted the purchase of a business for accounting and reporting purposes pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations. While the transaction included a continuation of the revenue-producing activities associated with the reinsured policies, it did not result in the acquisition of a market distribution system, sales force or production techniques. Based on Management s decision not to pursue distribution opportunities or future sales related to the reinsured policies, the Company accounted for the transaction as a reinsurance agreement under ASC 944, Insurance Contracts and asset acquisition under ASC 805. Accordingly, the Company recorded the assets and liabilities acquired under the reinsurance agreement at fair value and recognized an intangible asset (value of business acquired or  VOBA ) equal to the excess of the fair value of assets acquired over liabilities assumed, measured in accordance with the Company's accounting policies for insurance and reinsurance contracts that it issues or holds pursuant to ASC 944. 

4.                                            DAI-ICHI MERGER 
    
  On February 1, 2015 PLC, subsequent to required approvals from PLC s shareholders and relevant regulatory authorities, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Dai-ichi Life and DL Investment (Delaware), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life, which provided for the Merger of DL Investment (Delaware), Inc. with and into PLC, with PLC surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life. On February 1, 2015 each share of PLC s common stock outstanding was converted into the right to receive   $70   per share, without interest (the  Per Share Merger Consideration ). The aggregate cash consideration paid in connection with the Merger for the outstanding shares of common stock was approximately   $5.6 billion   and paid directly to the  

Table of Contents  

shareowners of record by Dai-ichi Life. The Merger provided Dai-ichi Life with a platform for growth in the United States, where it did not previously have a significant presence. In connection with the completion of the Merger, PLC s previously publicly traded equity was delisted from the NYSE, although PLC and the Company remain SEC registrants for financial reporting purposes in the United States. 
    
  The Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting under ASC Topic 805. In accordance with ASC Topic 805-20-30, all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. On the date of the Merger, goodwill of   $735.7 million   represented the cost in excess of the fair value of PLC s net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in the Merger, and reflected the Company s assembled workforce, future growth potential and other sources of value not associated with identifiable assets. During the measurement period subsequent to February 1, 2015, the Company made adjustments to provisional amounts related to certain tax balances that resulted in a decrease to goodwill of   $3.3 million   from the amount recorded at the Merger date. The balance of goodwill associated with the Merger as of December 31, 2015 (Successor Company) and   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) was   $732.4 million  .   None   of the goodwill is tax deductible. 

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: 

Treatment of Benefit Plans 
    
  At or immediately prior to the Merger, each stock appreciation right with respect to shares of PLC s Common Stock granted under any Stock Plan (each, a  SAR ) that were outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Merger and that had a base price per share of Common Stock underlying such SAR (the  Base Price ) that was less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (each such SAR, an  In-the-Money SAR ), whether or not exercisable or vested, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash less any applicable withholding taxes, determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the Per  

Table of Contents  

Share Merger Consideration over the Base Price of such In-the-Money SAR by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money SAR (such amount, the  SAR Consideration ). 
    
  At or immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each restricted stock unit with respect to a share of PLC Common Stock granted under any Stock Plan (each, a  RSU ) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, whether or not vested, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of RSUs. 
    
  The number of performance shares earned for each award of performance shares granted under any Stock Plan was calculated by determining the number of performance shares that would have been paid if the subject award period had ended on the December 31 immediately preceding the Merger (based on the conditions set for payment of performance share awards for the subject award period), provided that the number of performance shares earned for each award were not less than the aggregate number of performance shares at the target performance level. Each performance share earned that was outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, whether or not vested, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Performance Shares. 

5.                                            MONY CLOSED BLOCK OF BUSINESS 
    
  In 1998, MONY Life Insurance Company ( MONY ) converted from a mutual insurance company to a stock corporation ( demutualization ). In connection with its demutualization, an accounting mechanism known as a closed block (the  Closed Block ) was established for certain individuals  participating policies in force as of the date of demutualization. Assets, liabilities, and earnings of the Closed Block are specifically identified to support its participating policyholders. The Company acquired the Closed Block in conjunction with the acquisition of MONY in 2013. 
    
  Assets allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of each Closed Block s policyholders and will not revert to the benefit of MONY or the Company. No reallocation, transfer, borrowing or lending of assets can be made between the Closed Block and other portions of MONY s general account, any of MONY s separate accounts or any affiliate of MONY without the approval of the Superintendent of The New York State Department of Financial Services (the  Superintendent ). Closed Block assets and liabilities are carried on the same basis as similar assets and liabilities held in the general account. 
    
  The excess of Closed Block liabilities over Closed Block assets (adjusted to exclude the impact of related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI )) at the acquisition date of October 1, 2013, represented the estimated maximum future post-tax earnings from the Closed Block that would be recognized in income from continuing operations over the period the policies and contracts in the Closed Block remain in force. In connection with the acquisition of MONY, the Company developed an actuarial calculation of the expected timing of MONY s Closed Block s earnings as of October 1, 2013. Pursuant to the acquisition of the Company by Dai-ichi Life, this actuarial calculation of the expected timing of MONY s Closed Block earnings was recalculated and reset as of February 1, 2015, along with the establishment of a policyholder dividend obligation as of such date. 
    
  If the actual cumulative earnings from the Closed Block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be recognized in the Company s net income. Actual cumulative earnings in excess of expected cumulative earnings at any point in time are recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation because they will ultimately be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an additional policyholder dividend unless offset by future performance that is less favorable than originally expected. If a policyholder dividend obligation has been previously established and the actual Closed Block earnings in a subsequent period are less than the expected earnings for that period, the policyholder dividend obligation would be reduced (but not below zero). If, over the period the policies and contracts in the Closed Block remain in force, the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block are less than the expected cumulative earnings, only actual earnings would be recognized in income from continuing operations. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside the Closed Block. 
    
  Many expenses related to Closed Block operations, including amortization of VOBA, are charged to operations outside of the Closed Block; accordingly, net revenues of the Closed Block do not represent the actual profitability of the Closed Block operations. Operating costs and expenses outside of the Closed Block are, therefore, disproportionate to the business outside of the Closed Block.

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity fixed maturities as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), by expected maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities of securities without a single maturity date are allocated based on estimated rates of prepayment that may differ from actual rates of prepayment. 

The chart below summarizes the Company's other-than-temporary impairments of investments. All of the impairments were related to fixed maturities. 

There were   no   other-than-temporary impairments related to fixed maturities or equity securities that the Company intended to sell or expected to be required to sell for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), for the period of February 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), and for the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company). 
    
  The following chart is a rollforward of available-for-sale credit losses on fixed maturities held by the Company for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss):

The following table includes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ): 

RMBS and CMBS had gross unrealized losses greater than twelve months of   $4.1 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). Factors such as the credit enhancement within the deal structure, the average life of the securities, and the performance of the underlying collateral support the recoverability of these investments. 
    
  The other asset-backed securities had a gross unrealized loss greater than twelve months of   $15.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). This category predominately includes student-loan backed auction rate securities, the underlying collateral, of which is at least   97%   guaranteed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ). At this time, the Company has no reason to believe that the U.S. Department of Education would not honor the FFELP guarantee, if it were necessary. 
    
  The states, municipalities, and political subdivisions category had gross unrealized losses greater than twelve months of   $20.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). These declines were related to changes in interest rates. 
    
  The corporate securities category had gross unrealized losses greater than twelve months of   $684.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). The aggregate decline in market value of these securities was deemed temporary due to positive factors supporting the recoverability of the respective investments. Positive factors considered include credit ratings, the financial health of the issuer, the continued access of the issuer to capital markets, and other pertinent information 
    
  As of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ), the Company had a total of     1,230     positions that were in an unrealized loss position, but the Company does not consider these unrealized loss positions to be other-than-temporary. This is based on the aggregate factors discussed previously and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until the fair values recover, and the Company does not intend to sell or expect to be     required to sell the securities before recovering the Company s amortized cost of the securities.

The following table includes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ): 

The book value of the Company s investment portfolio was marked to fair value as of February 1, 2015 (  Successor Company  ), in conjunction with the Dai-ichi Merger which resulted in the elimination of previously unrealized gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income. The level of interest rates as of February 1, 2015 (  Successor Company  ) resulted in an increase in the carrying value of the Company s investments. Since February 1, 2015 (  Successor Company  ), interest rates have increased resulting in net unrealized losses in the Company s investment portfolio. 
    
  The Company does not consider these unrealized loss positions to be other-than-temporary, based on the aggregate factors discussed previously and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until the fair values recover, and does not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell the securities before recovering the Company's amortized cost of the securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company had securities in its available-for-sale portfolio which were rated below investment grade of   $1.9 billion   and had an amortized cost of   $2.0 billion  . In addition, included in the Company s trading portfolio, the Company held   $266.4 million   of securities which were rated below investment grade. Approximately   $328.6 million   of the available-for-sale and trading securities that were below investment grade were not publicly traded. 
    
  The change in unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax, on fixed matur  ity and equity securities, classified as available-for-sale is summarized as follows:

The amortized cost and fair value of the Company s investments classified as held-to-maturity as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) and   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), are as follows: 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of February 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company), the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairments on held-to-maturity securities.  
    
  The Company s held-to-maturity securi  ties had     $121.1 million     of gross unrealized gains and     $1.8 million   of gross unrecognized holding losses by maturity as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). The Company does not consider these unrecognized holding losses to be other-than-temporary based on certain positive factors associated with the securities which include credit ratings of the guarantor, financial health of the issuer and guarantor, continued access of the issuer to capital markets and other pertinent information. These held-to-maturity securities are issued by affiliates of the Company which are considered variable interest entities ("VIE's"). The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities and thus the securities are not eliminated in consolidation. These securities are collateralized by non-recourse funding obligations issued by captive insurance companies that are affiliates of the Company. 
    
  The Company s held-to-maturity securities had   $78.3 million   of gross unrecognized holding losses as of   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ). The Company does not consider these unrecognized holding losses to be other-than-temporary based on certain positive factors associated with the securities which include credit ratings of the guarantor, financial health of the issuer and guarantor, continued access of the issuer to capital markets and other pertinent information. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  The Company holds certain investments in entities in which its ownership interests could possibly be considered variable interests under Topic 810 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC  or  Codification ) (excluding debt and equity securities held as trading, available for sale, or held to maturity). The Company reviews the characteristics of each of these applicable entities and compares those characteristics to applicable criteria to determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). If the entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company then performs a detailed review to determine whether the interest would be considered a variable interest under the guidance. The Company then performs a qualitative review of all variable interests with the entity and determines whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. ASC 810 provides that an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if the entity has 1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
    
  Based on this analysis, the Company had an interest in   one   wholly owned subsidiary, Red Mountain, LLC ("Red Mountain") as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), that was determined to be a VIE. 
    
  The activity most significant to Red Mountain is the issuance of a note in connection with a financing transaction involving Golden Gate V Vermont Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate V ) and the Company in which Golden Gate V issued non-recourse funding obligations to Red Mountain and Red Mountain issued the note to Golden Gate V. Credit enhancement on the Red Mountain Note is provided by an unrelated third party. For details of this transaction, see Note 12,   Debt and Other Obligations  . The Company had the power, via its   100%   ownership through an affiliate, to direct the activities of the VIE, but did not have the obligation to absorb losses related to the primary risks or sources of variability to the VIE. The variability of loss would be borne  

Table of Contents  

primarily by the third party in its function as provider of credit enhancement on the Red Mountain Note. Accordingly, it was determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company s risk of loss related to the VIE is limited to its investment of   $10,000  . Additionally, the Company has guaranteed Red Mountain s payment obligation for the credit enhancement fee to the unrelated third party provider. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), no payments have been made or required related to this guarantee. 

7.                                         FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The Company determined the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in FASB guidance referenced in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company has adopted the provisions from the FASB guidance that is referenced in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic for non-financial assets and liabilities (such as property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis. The effect on the Company s periodic fair value measurements for non-financial assets and liabilities was not material. 
    
  The Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three level hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 
    
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows: 
    
     Level 1:   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 

Level 2:   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or significant inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include the following: 
       
  a)                                         Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
  b)                                         Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets 
  c)                                          Inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable 
  d)                                         Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. 

Level 3:   Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. They reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ): 

(1)Includes certain freestanding and embedded derivatives. 
      (2)Represents liabilities related to fixed indexed annuities.

Determination of fair values 
    
  The valuation methodologies used to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities reflect market participant assumptions and are based on the application of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable market inputs over unobservable inputs. The Company determines the fair values of certain financial assets and financial liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company also determines certain fair values based on future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. Fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Company s credit standing, liquidity, and where appropriate, risk margins on unobservable parameters. The following is a discussion of the methodologies used to determine fair values for the financial instruments as listed in the above table. 

The fair value of fixed maturity, short-term, and equity securities is determined by management after considering   one   of   three   primary sources of information: third party pricing services, non-binding independent broker quotations, or pricing matrices. Security pricing is applied using a  waterfall  approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party pricing services, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for non-binding prices, or lastly, securities are priced using a pricing matrix. Typical inputs used by these three pricing methods include, but are not limited to: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research publications. Third party pricing services price approxi  mately     91%     of the   Company s available-for-sale and trading fixed maturity securities. Based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for available-for-sale and trading fixed maturities, third party pricing services derive the majority of security prices from observable market inputs such as recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information outlined above. If there are no recent reported trades, the third party pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate. Certain securities are priced via independent non-binding broker quotations, which are considered to have no significant unobservable inputs. When using non- binding independent broker quotations, the Company obtains   one   quote per security, typically from the broker from which we purchased the security. A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is unable to obtain or effectively rely on either a price from a third party pricing service or an independent broker quotation. 
    
  The pricing matrix used by the Company begins with current spread levels to determine the market price for the security. The credit spreads, assigned by brokers, incorporate the issuer s credit rating, liquidity discounts, weighted- average of contracted cash flows, risk premium, if warranted, due to the issuer s industry, and the security s time to maturity. The Company uses credit ratings provided by nationally recognized rating agencies. 
    
  For securities that are priced via non-binding independent broker quotations, the Company assesses whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through an analysis using internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and, when available, market indices. The Company uses a market-based cash flow analysis to validate the reasonableness of prices received from independent brokers. These analytics, which are updated daily, incorporate various metrics (yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates, etc.) to determine the valuation of such holdings. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the analytics, the price received from the independent broker is adjusted accordingly. The Company did not adjust any quotes or prices received from brokers during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  The Company has analyzed the third party pricing services  valuation methodologies and related inputs and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs that is in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC. Based on this evaluation and investment class analysis, each price was classified into Level 1, 2, or 3. Most prices provided by third party pricing services are classified into Level 2 because the significant inputs used in pricing the securities are market observable and the observable inputs are corroborated by the Company. Since the matrix pricing of certain debt securities includes significant non-observable inputs, they are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Asset-Backed Securities 
    
  This category mainly     consists of residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities (collectively referred to as asset-backed securities or  ABS ). As of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ), the Company held     $4.7 billion     of ABS classified as Level 2. These securities are priced from information provided by a third party pricing service and independent broker quotes. The third party pricing services and brokers mainly value securities using both a market and income approach to valuation. As part of this valuation process they consider the following characteristics of the item being measured to be relevant inputs: 1) weighted-average coupon rate, 2) weighted-average years to maturity, 3) types of underlying assets, 4) weighted-average coupon rate of the underlying assets, 5) weighted-average years to maturity of the underlying assets, 6) seniority level of the tranches owned, and 7) credit ratings of the securities. 
    
  After reviewing these characteristics of the ABS, the third party pricing service and brokers use certain inputs to determine the value of the security. For ABS classified as Level 2, the valuation would consist of predominantly market observable inputs such as, but not limited to: 1) monthly principal and interest payments on the underlying assets, 2) average life of the security, 3) prepayment speeds, 4) credit spreads, 5) treasury and swap yield curves, and 6) discount margin. The Company reviews the methodologies and valuation techniques (including the ability to observe inputs) in assessing the information received from external pricing services and in consideration of the fair value presentation. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company held   $722.6 million   of Level 3 ABS, which included   $553.2 million   of other asset-backed securities classified as available-for-sale and   $145.8 million   of other asset-backed securities classified as trading. These securities are predominantly ARS whose underlying collateral is at least   97%   guaranteed by the FFELP. As a result of the ARS market collapse during 2008, the Company prices its ARS using an income approach valuation model. As part of the valuation process the Company reviews the following characteristics of the ARS in determining the relevant inputs: 1) weighted-average coupon rate, 2) weighted-average years to maturity, 3) types of underlying assets, 4) weighted-average coupon rate of the underlying assets, 5) weighted-average years to maturity of the underlying assets, 6) seniority level of the tranches owned, 7) credit ratings of the securities, 8) liquidity premium, and 9) paydown rate. 

C  orporate Securities, U.S. Government-Related Securities, States, Municipals, and Political Subdivisions, and Other Government Related Securities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company classified approximately   $32.0 billion   of corporate securities, U.S. government-related securities, states, municipals, and political subdivisions, and other government-related securities as Level 2. The fair value of the Level 2 securities is predominantly priced by broker quotes and a third party pricing service. The Company has reviewed the valuation techniques of the brokers and third party pricing service and has determined that such techniques used Level 2 market observable inputs. The following characteristics of the securities are considered to be the primary relevant inputs to the valuation: 1) weighted- average coupon rate, 2) weighted-average years to maturity, 3) seniority, and 4) credit ratings. The Company reviews the methodologies and valuation techniques (including the ability to observe inputs) in assessing the information received from external pricing services and in consideration of the fair value presentation. 
    
  The brokers and third party pricing service utilize valuation models that consist of a hybrid income and market approach to valuation. The pricing models utilize the following inputs: 1) principal and interest payments, 2) treasury yield curve, 3) credit spreads from new issue and secondary trading markets, 4) dealer quotes with adjustments for issues with early redemption features, 5) liquidity premiums present on private placements, and 6) discount margins from dealers in the new issue market. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company classified approximately   $759.1 million   of securities as Level 3 valuations. Level 3 securities primarily represent investments in illiquid bonds for which no price is readily available. To determine a price, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model with both observable and unobservable inputs. These inputs are entered into an industry standard pricing model to determine the final price of the security. These inputs include: 1) principal and interest payments, 2) coupon rate, 3) sector and issuer level spread over treasury, 4) underlying collateral, 5) credit ratings, 6) maturity, 7) embedded options, 8) recent new issuance, 9) comparative bond analysis, and 10) an illiquidity premium. 
    
  Equities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company held approximately   $66.5 million   of equity securities classified as Level 2 and Level 3. Of this total,   $65.7 million   represents Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) stock. The Company believes that the cost of the FHLB stock approximates fair value.  
    
  Other long-term investments and Other liabilities 
    
  Other long-term investments and other liabilities consist entirely of free-standing and embedded derivative financial instruments. Refer to Note 8,   Derivative Financial Instruments   for additional information related to derivatives. Derivative financial instruments are valued using exchange prices, independent broker quotations, or pricing valuation models, which utilize market data inputs. Excluding embedded derivatives, as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   78.1%   of derivatives based upon notional values were priced using exchange prices or independent broker quotations. The remaining derivatives were priced by pricing valuation models, which predominantly utilize observable market data inputs. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest swap rates, credit spreads, interest rate and equity market volatility indices, equity index levels, and treasury rates. The Company performs monthly analysis on derivative valuations that includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses. 
    
  Derivative instruments classified as Level 1 generally include futures and options, which are traded on active exchange markets. 
    
  Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 primarily include interest rate and inflation swaps, options, and swaptions. These derivative valuations are determined using independent broker quotations, which are corroborated with observable market inputs. 
    
  Derivative instruments classified as Level 3 were embedded derivatives and include at least one significant non-observable input. A derivative instrument containing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs will be classified as a Level 3 financial instrument in its entirety if it has at least one significant Level 3 input. 
    
  The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instruments may not be classified within the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated assets and liabilities. Therefore, the changes in fair value on derivatives reported in Level 3 may not reflect the offsetting impact of the changes in fair value of the associated assets and liabilities. 
    
  The embedded derivatives are carried at fair value in  other long-term investments  and  other liabilities  on the Company s consolidated condensed balance sheet. The changes in fair value are recorded in earnings as  Realized investment gains (losses)-Derivative financial instruments . Refer to Note 8,   Derivative Financial Instruments   for more information related to each embedded derivatives gains and losses. 
    
  The fair value of the GMWB embedded derivative is derived through the income method of valuation using a valuation model that projects future cash flows using multiple risk neutral stochastic equity scenarios and policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk neutral scenarios are generated using the current swap curve and projected equity volatilities and correlations. The projected equity volatilities are based on a blend of historical volatility and near- term equity market implied  

volatilities. The equity correlations are based on historical price observations. For policyholder behavior assumptions, expected lapse and utilization assumptions are used and updated for actual experience, as necessary. The Company assumes age-based mortality from the   the Ruark 2015 ALB table with attained age factors varying from   91.1%     -     106.6%  . The present value of the cash flows is determined using the discount rate curve, which is based upon     LIBOR     plus a credit spread (to represent the Company s non-performance risk). As a result of using significant unobservable inputs, the GMWB embedded derivative is categorized as Level 3. These assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
    
  The balance of the FIA embedded derivative is impacted by policyholder cash flows associated with the FIA product that are allocated to the embedded derivative in addition to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative during the reporting period. The fair value of the FIA embedded derivative is derived through the income method of valuation using a valuation model that projects future cash flows using current index values and volatility, the hedge budget used to price the product, and policyholder assumptions (both elective and non-elective). For policyholder behavior assumptions, expected lapse and withdrawal assumptions are used and updated for actual experience, as necessary. The Company assumes age-based mortality from the 1994 Variable Annuity MGDB mortality table modified for company experience, with attained age factors varying from   46%   -   113%  . The present value of the cash flows is determined using the discount rate curve, which is based upon   LIBOR   up to one year and constant maturity treasury rates plus a credit spread (to represent the Company s non-performance risk) thereafter. Policyholder assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. As a result of using significant unobservable inputs, the FIA embedded derivative is categorized as Level 3. 
    
  The balance of the indexed universal life ( IUL ) embedded derivative is impacted by policyholder cash flows associated with the IUL product that are allocated to the embedded derivative in addition to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative during the reporting period. The fair value of the IUL embedded derivative is derived through the income method of valuation using a valuation model that projects future cash flows using current index values and volatility, the hedge budget used to price the product, and policyholder assumptions (both elective and non-elective). For policyholder behavior assumptions, expected lapse and withdrawal assumptions are used and updated for actual experience, as necessary. The Company assumes age-based mortality from     SOA 2015 VBT Primary Tables modified with company experience, with attained age factors varying from     38%     -     153%  . The present value of the cash flows is determined using the discount rate curve, which is based upon     LIBOR     up to one year and constant maturity treasury rates plus a credit spread (to represent the Company s non-performance risk) thereafter. Policyholder assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. As a result of using significant unobservable inputs, the IUL embedded derivative is categorized as Level 3. 
    
  The Company has assumed and ceded certain blocks of policies under modified coinsurance agreements in which the investment results of the underlying portfolios inure directly to the reinsurers. As a result, these agreements contain embedded derivatives that are reported at fair value. Changes in their fair value are reported in earnings. The investments supporting these agreements are designated as  trading securities  therefore changes in their fair value are also reported in earnings. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the fair value of the embedded derivative is based upon the relationship between the statutory policy liabilities (net of policy loans) of   $2.4 billion   and the statutory unrealized gain (loss) of the securities of   $265.6 million  . As a result, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the related investments and each are reported in earnings. The fair value of the embedded derivative is considered a Level 3 valuation due to the unobservable nature of the policy liabilities. 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries have entered into interest support, yearly renewable term ( YRT ) premium support, and portfolio maintenance agreements with PLC. These agreements meet the definition of a derivative and are accounted for at fair value and are considered Level 3 valuations. The fair value of these derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) was   $50.7 million   and is included in Other long-term investments. For information regarding realized gains on these derivatives please refer to Note 8,   Derivative Financial Instruments  . 
    
  The Interest Support Agreement provides that PLC will make payments to Golden Gate II if actual investment income on certain of Golden Gate II s asset portfolios falls below a calculated investment income amount as defined in the Interest Support Agreement. The calculated investment income amount is a level of investment income deemed to be sufficient to support certain of Golden Gate II s obligations under a reinsurance agreement with the Company, dated July 1, 2007. The derivative is valued using an internal valuation model that assumes a conservative projection of investment income under an adverse interest rate scenario and the probability that the expectation falls below the calculated investment income amount. This derivative had a fair value of   $44.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), no payments have been triggered under this agreement, however, certain interest support agreement obligations to Golden Gate II of approximately   $1.5 million   have been collateralized by PLC. Re-evaluation and, if necessary, adjustments of any support agreement collateralization amounts occur annually during the first quarter pursuant to the terms of the support agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been triggered under this agreement. 
    
  The YRT premium support agreements provide that PLC will make payments to Golden Gate and Golden Gate II in the event that YRT premium rates increase. The derivatives are valued using an internal valuation model. The valuation model is a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The value is primarily a function of the likelihood and severity of future YRT premium increases. The fair value of these derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) was   $2.7 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been made under these agreements. 
    
  The portfolio maintenance agreements provide that PLC will make payments to Golden Gate, Golden Gate V, and WCL in the event of other-than-temporary impairments on investments that exceed defined thresholds. The derivatives are valued using an internal discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable inputs are the projected probability and severity of credit losses used to project future cash flows on the investment portfolios. The fair value of the portfolio maintenance  

agreements as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), was   $3.6 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been made under these agreements. 
    
  The Funds Withheld derivative results from a reinsurance agreement with Shades Creek where the economic performance of certain hedging instruments held by the Company is ceded to Shades Creek. The value of the Funds Withheld derivative is directly tied to the value of the hedging instruments held in the funds withheld account. The hedging instruments predominantly consist of derivative instruments the fair values of which are classified as a Level 2 measurement; as such, the fair value of the Funds Withheld derivative has been classified as a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of the Funds Withheld derivative as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) was a liability of   $112.3 million  . 
    
  Annuity account balances 
    
  The Company records certain of its FIA reserves at fair value. The fair value is considered a Level 3 valuation. The FIA valuation model calculates the present value of future benefit cash flows less the projected future profits to quantify the net liability that is held as a reserve. This calculation is done using multiple risk neutral stochastic equity scenarios. The cash flows are discounted using LIBOR plus a credit spread. Best estimate assumptions are used for partial withdrawals, lapses, expenses and asset earned rate with a risk margin applied to each. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually as a part of the formal unlocking process. If an event were to occur within a quarter that would make the assumptions unreasonable, the assumptions would be reviewed within the quarter. 
    
  The discount rate for the fixed indexed annuities is based on an upward sloping rate curve which is updated each quarter. The discount rates for   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), ranged from a one month rate of   0.73%  , a 5 year rate of   1.99%  , and a 30 year rate of   2.97%  . A credit spread component is also included in the calculation to accommodate non-performance risk. 
    
  Separate Accounts 
    
  Separate account assets are invested in open-ended mutual funds and are included in Level 1. 

Valuation of Level 3 Financial Instruments 
    
  The following table presents the valuation method for material financial instruments included in Level 3, as well as the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of those financial instruments: 

(1)The fair value for the GMWB embedded derivative is presented as a net liability for the purposes of this chart. Excludes modified coinsurance arrangements. 
  (2)Represents liabilities related to fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  The chart above excludes Level 3 financial instruments that are valued using broker quotes and those which book value approximates fair value. 

The Company has considered all reasonably available quantitative inputs as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), but the valuation techni  ques and inputs used by some brokers in pricing certain financial instruments are not shared with the Company. This resulted in     $210.6 million     of financial instruments being classified as Level 3 as of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ). Of the     $210.6 million  ,     $178.4 million     are other asset-backed securities and     $32.2 million     are corporate securities. 
    
  In certain cases the Company has determined that book value materially approximates fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company held   $66.5 million   of financial instruments where book value approximates fair value which were predominantly FHLB stock. 

The following table presents the valuation method for material financial instruments included in Level 3, as well as the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of those financial instruments: 

(1)The fair value for the GMWB embedded derivative is presented as a net liability, for the purposes of this chart.  Excludes modified coinsurance arrangements. 
  (2)Represents liabilities related to fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  The chart above excludes Level 3 financial instruments that are valued using broker quotes and those which book value approximates fair value. 
    
  The Company has considered all reasonably available quantitative inputs as of   December 31, 2015   (Successor Company), but the valuation techniques and inputs used by some brokers in pricing certain financial instruments are not shared with the Company. This resulted in   $197.5 million   of financial instruments being classified as Level 3 as of   December 31, 2015   (Successor Company). Of the   $197.5 million  ,   $152.9 million   are other asset backed securities and   $44.6 million   are corporate securities. 

In certain cases the Company has determined that book value materially approximates fair value. As of   December 31, 2015   (Successor Company), the Company held   $66.5 million   of financial instruments where book value approximates fair value which are predominantly FHLB stock. 
    
  The asset-backed securities classified as Level 3 are predominantly ARS. A change in the paydown rate (the projected annual rate of principal reduction) of the ARS can significantly impact the fair value of these securities. A decrease in the paydown rate would increase the projected weighted average life of the ARS and increase the sensitivity of the ARS  fair value to changes in interest rates. An increase in the liquidity premium would result in a decrease in the fair value of the securities, while a decrease in the liquidity premium would increase the fair value of these securities. 
    
  The fair value of corporate bonds classified as Level 3 is sensitive to changes in the interest rate spread over the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate. This spread represents a risk premium that is impacted by company specific and market factors. An increase in the spread can be caused by a perceived increase in credit risk of a specific issuer and/or an increase in the overall market risk premium associated with similar securities. The fair values of corporate bonds are sensitive to changes in spread. When holding the treasury rate constant, the fair value of corporate bonds increases when spreads decrease, and decreases when spreads increase. 
    
  The fair value of the GMWB embedded derivative is sensitive to changes in the discount rate which includes the Company s nonperformance risk, volatility, lapse, and mortality assumptions. The volatility assumption is an observable input as it is based on market inputs. The Company s nonperformance risk, lapse, and mortality are unobservable. An increase in the three unobservable assumptions would result in a decrease in the fair value of the liability and conversely, if there is a decrease in the assumptions the fair value would increase. The fair value is also dependent on the assumed policyholder utilization of the GMWB where an increase in assumed utilization would result in an increase in the fair value of the liability and conversely, if there is a decrease in the assumption, the fair value would decrease. 
    
  The fair value of the FIA account balance liability is predominantly impacted by observable inputs such as discount rates and equity returns. However, the fair value of the FIA embedded derivative is sensitive to non-performance risk, which is unobservable. The value of the liability increases with decreases in discount rate and non-performance risk and decreases with increases in the discount rate and non-performance risk. The value of the liability increases with increases in equity returns and the liability decreases with a decrease in equity returns. 
    
  The fair value of the FIA embedded derivative is predominantly impacted by observable inputs such as discount rates and equity returns. However, the fair value of the FIA embedded derivative is sensitive to non-performance risk, which is unobservable. The value of the liability increases with decreases in the discount rate and non-performance risk and decreases with increases in the discount rate and nonperformance risk. The value of the liability increases with increases in equity returns and the liability decreases with a decrease in equity returns. 
    
  The fair value of the IUL embedded derivative is predominantly impacted by observable inputs such as discount rates and equity returns. However, the fair value of the IUL embedded derivative is sensitive to non-performance risk, which is unobservable. The value of the liability increases with decreases in the discount rate and non-performance risk and decreases with increases in the discount rate and non-performance risk. The value of the liability increases with increases in equity returns and the liability decreases with a decrease in equity returns.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for fair value measurements for the period of   February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), for which the Company has used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

(1)Represents certain freestanding and embedded derivatives. 
  (2)Represents liabilities related to fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  For the period of   February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), there were   no   transfers of securities into Level 3.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for fair value measurements for period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ), for which the Company has used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

(1)Represents certain freestanding and embedded derivatives. 
  (2)Represents liabilities related to fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  For the period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ),   $43.2 million   of securities were transferred into Level 3. This amount was transferred from Level 2. These transfers resulted from securities that were priced by independent pricing services or brokers in previous periods, using no significant unobservable inputs, but were priced internally using significant unobservable inputs where market observable inputs were no longer available as of January 31, 2015 (  Predecessor Company  ). All transfers are recognized as of the end of the period. 
    
  For the period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ), there were   no   transfers from Level 3 to Level 2. 
    
  For the period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ), there were   no   transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 and there were   no   transfers out of Level 1. 
    
       Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) on Level 3 assets and liabilities are primarily reported in either realized investment gains (losses) within the consolidated condensed statements of income (loss) or other comprehensive income (loss) within shareowner s equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the item. 
    
  Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, net, represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period. Such activity primarily relates to purchases and sales of fixed maturity securities and issuances and settlements of fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period. Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are  

reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur. The asset transfers in the table(s) above primarily related to positions moved from Level 3 to Level 2 as the Company determined that certain inputs were observable. 
    
  The amount of total gains (losses) for assets and liabilities still held as of the reporting date primarily represents changes in fair value of trading securities and certain derivatives that exist as of the reporting date and the change in fair value of fixed indexed annuities. 
    
  Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of the periods shown below are as follows: 

Except as noted below, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices. 
    
   (1)       Securities purchased from unconsolidated affiliates, Red Mountain LLC and Steel City LLC. 
   (2)       Of this carrying amount,     $2.7 billion  , fair value of     $2.9 billion  , as of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ), and     $500.0 million  , fair value of     $495.5 million  , as of     December 31, 2015     (Successor Company), relates to non-recourse funding obligations issued by Golden Gate and Golden Gate V. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Mortgage loans on real estate 
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of mortgage loans using an internally developed model. This model includes inputs derived by the Company based on assumed discount rates relative to the Company s current mortgage loan lending rate and an expected cash flow analysis based on a review of the mortgage loan terms. The model also contains the Company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to credit and liquidity risks. 
    
  Policy loans 
    
  The Company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates book value. Policy loans are funds provided to policy holders in return for a claim on the policy. The funds provided are limited to the cash surrender value of the underlying policy. The nature of policy loans is to have a negligible default risk as the loans are fully collateralized by the value of the policy. Policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid either by the policyholder or with proceeds from the policy. Due to the collateralized nature of policy loans and unpredictable timing of repayments, the Company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates carrying value. 
    
  Fixed maturities, held-to-maturity 
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of its fixed maturity, held-to-maturity securities using internal discounted cash flow models. The discount rates used in the model are based on a current market yield for similar financial instruments. 
    
  Stable Value Product and Annuity Account Balances 
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of stable value product account balances and annuity account balances using models based on discounted expected cash flows. The discount rates used in the models are based on a current market rate for similar financial instruments. 

Non-recourse Funding Obligations 
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of its non-recourse funding obligations using internal discounted cash flow models. The discount rates used in the model are based on a current market yield for similar financial instruments. 

8.                                       DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Types of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies 
    
  The Company utilizes a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to certain risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency exchange risk, volatility risk, and equity market risk. These strategies are developed through the Company s analysis of data from financial simulation models and other internal and industry sources, and are then incorporated into the Company s risk management program. 
    
  Derivative instruments expose the Company to credit and market risk and could result in material changes from period to period. The Company attempts to minimize its credit risk by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties. The Company manages the market risk by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may be undertaken. The Company monitors its use of derivatives in connection with its overall asset/liability management programs and risk management strategies. In addition, all derivative programs are monitored by our risk management department. 
    
  Derivatives Related to Interest Rate Risk Management 
    
  Derivative instruments that are used as part of the Company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps, and interest rate swaptions. The Company s inflation risk management strategy involves the use of swaps that requires the Company to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate that is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ). 
    
  Derivatives Related to Risk Mitigation of Certain Annuity Contracts 
    
  The Company may use the following types of derivative contracts to mitigate its exposure to certain guaranteed benefits related to VA contracts and fixed indexed annuities: 
    
     Foreign Currency Futures 
     Variance Swaps 
     Interest Rate Futures 
     Equity Options 
     Equity Futures 
     Credit Derivatives 
     Interest Rate Swaps 
     Interest Rate Swaptions 
     Volatility Futures 
     Volatility Options 
     Funds Withheld Agreement 
     Total Return Swaps 
    
  Other Derivatives 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have derivatives with PLC. These derivatives consist of an interest support agreement, YRT premium support agreements, and portfolio maintenance agreements with PLC. 
    
  The Company has a funds withheld account that consists of various derivative instruments held by us that is used to hedge the GMWB and GMDB riders. The economic performance of derivatives in the funds withheld account is ceded to Shades Creek. The funds withheld account is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument. 
    
  Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company records its derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet in  other long-term investments  and  other liabilities  in accordance with GAAP, which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. The change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is reported either in the statement of income or in other comprehensive income (loss), depending upon whether it qualified for and also has been properly identified as being part of a hedging relationship, and also on the type of hedging relationship that exists. 
    
  For a derivative financial instrument to be accounted for as an accounting hedge, it must be identified and documented as such on the date of designation. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of their realized gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item impacts earnings. Any remaining gain or loss, the ineffective portion, is recognized in current earnings. For fair value hedge derivatives, their gain or loss as well as the offsetting loss or gain attributable to the hedged risk of the hedged item is recognized in current earnings. Effectiveness of the Company s hedge relationships is assessed on a quarterly basis. 

Table of Contents  

The Company reports changes in fair values of derivatives that are not part of a qualifying hedge relationship through earnings in the period of change. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are recognized in current earnings are reported in  Realized investment gains (losses)-Derivative financial instruments . 
    
  Derivative Instruments Designated and Qualifying as Hedging Instruments 
    
  Cash-Flow Hedges 

In connection with the issuance of inflation-adjusted funding agreements, the Company has entered into swaps to essentially convert the floating CPI-linked interest rate on these agreements to a fixed rate. The Company pays a fixed rate on the swap and receives a floating rate primarily determined by the period s change in the CPI. The amounts that are received on the swaps are almost equal to the amounts that are paid on the agreements.   None   of these positions were held as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), as these funding agreements and correlating swaps matured in June of 2015. 
       
  Derivative Instruments Not Designated and Not Qualifying as Hedging Instruments 
    
  The Company uses various other derivative instruments for risk management purposes that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings during the period of change. 
    
  Derivatives Related to Variable Annuity Contracts

The table below present information about the nature and accounting treatment of the Company s primary derivative financial instruments and the location in and effect on the consolidated condensed financial statements for the periods presented below: 

(1)These derivatives include the Interest, YRT premium support, and portfolio maintenance agreements between certain of the Company s subsidiaries and PLC. 
    
  During the first quarter 2016, the Company revised its methodology for estimating notional amounts associated with the YRT Support Agreements among certain of its affiliates. The Company's revised approach reflects its position that no reasonably estimable notional amounts exist for the YRT Support Agreements, which contain payment positions based on the movement of the underlying premium rates, as described in Note 7,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  . Current period amounts disclosed above reflect this change in estimate, which did not impact the Company's financial position or results of operations. 

9.               OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
    
  Certain of the Company s derivative instruments are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of all derivative contracts between the Company and a counterparty in the event of default or upon the occurrence of certain termination events. Collateral support agreements associated with each master netting arrangement provide that the Company will receive or pledge financial collateral in the event either minimum thresholds, or in certain cases ratings levels, have been reached. Additionally, certain of the Company s repurchase agreements provide for net settlement on termination of the agreement. Refer to Note 12,   Debt and Other Obligations   for details of the Company s repurchase agreement programs.

10.                                      MORTGAGE LOANS 
    
  Mortgage Loans 
    
  The Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in commercial mortgage loans. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the Company s mortgage loan holdings were appr  oximately     $5.9 billion  . The Company has specialized in making loans on either credit-oriented commercial properties or credit-anchored strip shopping centers and apartments. The Company s underwriting procedures relative to its commercial loan portfolio are based, in the Company s view, on a conservative and disciplined approach. The Company concentrates on a small number of commercial real estate asset types associated with the necessities of life (retail, multi-family, senior living, professional office buildings, and warehouses). The Company believes that these asset types tend to weather economic downturns better than other commercial asset classes in which it has chosen not to participate. The Company believes this disciplined approach has helped to maintain a relatively low delinquency and foreclosure rate throughout its history. The majority of the Company s mortgage loans portfolio was underwritten by the Company. From time to time, the Company may acquire loans in conjunction with an acquisition. 
    
  The Company s commercial mortgage loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, and net of valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan s contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. 
    
  As of February 1, 2015, all mortgage loans were measured at fair value. Each mortgage loan was individually analyzed to determine the fair value. Each loan was either analyzed and assigned a discount rate or given an impairment, based on whether facts and circumstances which, as of the acquisition date, indicated less than full projected collections of contractual principal and interest payments. Various market factors were considered in determining the net present value of the expected cash flow stream or underlying real estate collateral, including the characteristics of the borrower, the underlying collateral, underlying credit worthiness of the tenants, and tenant payment history. Known events and risks, such as refinancing risks, were also considered in the fair value determination. In certain cases, fair value was based on the net present value of the expected cash flow stream or the underlying value of the real estate collateral. 
    
  Certain of the mortgage loans have call options that occur within the next   12     years  . However, if interest rates were to significantly increase, we may be unable to exercise the call options on our existing mortgage loans commensurate with the  

Table of Contents  

significantly inc  reased market rates. As of     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company), assuming the loans are called at their next call dates, approximately     $28.1 million     of principal would become due for the remainder of 2016,     $972.7 million     in 2017 through 2021,     $235.0 million     in 2022 through 2026, and     $11.0 million     thereafter. 
    
  The Company offers a type of commercial mortgage loan under which the Company will permit a loan-to-value ratio of up to   85%   in exchange for a participating interest in the cash flows from the underlying real estate. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) and   December 31, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), approximately   $549.2 million   and   $449.2 million  , respectively, of the Company s total mortgage loan principal balance have this participation feature. Cash flows received as a result of this participation feature are recorded as interest income. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of   February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), and   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ), the Company recognized   $3.3 million  ,   $15.8 million  ,   $3.3 million  ,   $8.4 million  , and   $0.1 million  , respectively, of participating mortgage loan income. 
    
  As of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ), approximately     $1.0 million     of invested assets consisted of nonperforming mortgage loans, restructured mortgage loans, or mortgage loans that were foreclosed and were converted to real estate properties. The Company does not expect these investments to adversely affect its liquidity or ability to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. During the nine months ended     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company),     the Company did not enter into any mortgage loan transactions that would have been accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. If the Company had troubled debt restructurings, these transactions would include either the acceptance of assets in satisfaction of principal during the respective periods or at a future date, and were the result of agreements between the creditor and the debtor  . During the nine months ended     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company), the Company did not accept or agree to accept assets in satisfaction of principal. As of     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company), the Company did not have any mortgage loan transactions accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. 
    
  The Company s mortgage loan portfolio consists of   two   categories of loans: 1) those not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement and 2) those subject to a contractual pooling and servicing agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   $1.0 million   of mortgage loans not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement were nonperforming mortgage loans, restructured, or mortgage loans that were foreclosed and were converted to real estate properties. The Company foreclosed on   $1.0 million   of nonperforming loans not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   none   of the loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement were nonperforming or restructured. The Company did not foreclose on any nonperforming loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). 
    
  As of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ), the Company had an allowance for mortgage loan credit losses of     $3.4 million     and     no     allowance as of December 31, 2015 (Successor Company). Due to the Company s loss experience and nature of the loan portfolio, the Company believes that a collectively evaluated allowance would be inappropriate. The Company believes an allowance calculated through an analysis of specific loans that are believed to have a higher risk of credit impairment provides a more accurate presentation of expected losses in the portfolio and     is consistent with the applicable guidance for loan impairments in ASC Subtopic 310. Since the Company uses the specific identification method for calculating the allowance, it is necessary to review the economic situation of each borrower to determine those that have higher risk of credit impairment. The Company has a team of professionals that monitors borrower conditions such as payment practices, borrower credit, operating performance, and property conditions, as well as ensuring the timely payment of property taxes and insurance. Through this monitoring process, the Company assesses the risk of each loan. When issues are identified, the severity of the issues are assessed and reviewed for possible credit impairment. If a loss is probable, an expected loss calculation is performed and an allowance is established for that loan based on the expected loss. The expected loss is calculated as the excess carrying value of a loan over either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, or the current estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral. A loan may be subsequently charged off at such point that the Company no longer expects to receive cash payments, the present value of future expected payments of the renegotiated loan is less than the current principal balance, or at such time that the Company is party to foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings associated with the borrower and does not expect to recover the principal balance of the loan. 
    
  A charge off is recorded by eliminating the allowance against the mortgage loan and recording the renegotiated loan or the collateral property related to the loan as investment real estate on the balance sheet, which is carried at the lower of the appraised fair value of the property or the unpaid principal balance of the loan, less estimated selling costs associated with the property.

It is the Company s policy to cease to carry accrued interest on loans that are over   90 days   delinquent. For loans less than   90 days   delinquent, interest is accrued unless it is determined that the accrued interest is not collectible. If a loan becomes over   90 days   delinquent, it is the Company s general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current is in place. For loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement, there are certain additional restrictions and/or requirements related to workout proceedings, and as such, these loans may have different attributes and/or circumstances affecting the status of delinquency or categorization of those in nonperforming status. An analysis of the delinquent loans is shown in the following chart.  

The Company s commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that are collateralized by real estate. Due to the collateralized nature of the loans, any assessment of impairment and ultimate loss given a default on the loans is based upon a consideration of the estimated fair value of the real estate. The Company limits accrued interest income on impaired loans to   90 days   of interest. Once accrued interest on the impaired loan is received, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. For information regarding impaired loans, please refer to the following chart:  

As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), the Company did not carry any mortgage loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring.  

11.                                     GOODWILL 
    
  As permitted by ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , the Company measured its assets and liabilities at fair value on the date of the Merger, February 1, 2015. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of PLC s assets and liabilities resulted in the establishment of goodwill as of the date of the Merger. As of February 1, 2015 (Successor Company), the Company was allocated an aggregate goodwill balance of   $735.7 million  . During the measurement period subsequent to February 1, 2015, the Company has made adjustments to provisional amounts related to certain tax balances that resulted in a decrease to goodwill of   $3.3 million   from the amount recorded at the Merger date. This reduction in Goodwill was applied to the Life Marketing segment's goodwill. The balance of goodwill associated with the Merger as of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company) was   $732.4 million  . There has been   no   change in the goodwill during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  Accounting for goodwill requires an estimate of the future profitability of the associated lines of business to assess the recoverability of the capitalized acquisition goodwill. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill at the segment (or reporting unit) level at least annually and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: 1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2) unanticipated competition, or 3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company first determines through qualitative analysis whether relevant events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that segment goodwill balances are impaired as of the testing date. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, the Company compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company utilizes a fair value measurement (which includes a discounted cash flows analysis) to assess the carrying  

Table of Contents  

value of the reporting units in consideration of the recoverability of the goodwill balance assigned to each reporting unit as of the measurement date. The Company s material goodwill balances are attributable to certain of its operating segments (which are each considered to be reporting units). The cash flows used to determine the fair value of the Company s reporting units are dependent on a number of significant assumptions. The Company s estimates, which consider a market participant view of fair value, are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future results and cash flows, which are impacted by such things as policyholder behavior, competitor pricing, capital limitations, new product introductions, and specific industry and market conditions. 
    
  The balance recognized as goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently as events or circumstances may warrant, including those circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company s reporting units below its carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company performed its annual evaluation of goodwill based on information as of September 30, 2015 (Successor Company) and determined that no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the Company did not identify any events or circumstances which would indicate that the fair value of its operating segments would have declined below their book value, either individually or in the aggregate. Accordingly,   no   impairment to the Company s goodwill balance has been recorded.  

12.                                   DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS 
    
  In conjunction with the Merger and in accordance with ASC Topic 805, the Company adjusted the carrying value of debt to fair value as of the date of the Merger, February 1, 2015. This resulted in the Company establishing premiums and discounts on its outstanding debt, subordinated debentures and non-recourse funding obligations. The carrying value of the Company s revolving line of credit approximates fair value due to the nature of the borrowings and the fact the Company pays a variable rate of interest that reflects current market conditions. The fair value of the Company s senior notes, subordinated debt, non-recourse funding obligations associated with Golden Gate II Captive Insurance Company and MONY Life Insurance Company, were determined using market prices as of February 1, 2015. The fair value of the Golden Gate V non-recourse funding obligation was determined using a discounted cash flow model with inputs derived from comparable financial instruments. The premiums and discounts established as of February 1, 2015 are amortized over the expected life of the instruments using the effective interest method. The amortization of premiums and discounts are recorded as a component of interest expense and are recorded in  Other operating expenses  on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. 
    
  On February 2, 2015, the Company and PLC amended and restated the Credit Facility (the  Credit Facility ). Under the Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to borrow on an unsecured basis up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.0 billion  . The Company has the right in certain circumstances to request that the commitment under the Credit Facility be increased up to a maximum principal amount of   $1.25 billion  . Balances outstanding under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Borrowers, (i)   LIBOR   plus a spread based on the ratings of PLC s Senior Debt, or (ii) the sum of (A) a rate equal to the highest of (x) the Administrative Agent s   prime rate  , (y)   0.50%   above the   Federal Funds rate  , or (z) the   one-month LIBOR   plus   1.00%   and (B) a spread based on the ratings of PLC s Senior Debt. The Credit Facility also provided for a facility fee at a rate that varies with the ratings of PLC s Senior Debt and that is calculated on the aggregate amount of commitments under the Credit Facility, whether used or unused. The initial facility fee rate was   0.15%   on February 2, 2015, and was adjusted to   0.125%   upon PLC s subsequent ratings upgrade on February 2, 2015. The Credit Facility provides that PLC is liable for the full amount of any obligations for borrowings or letters of credit, including those of the Company, under the Credit Facility. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is February 2, 2020. The Company is not aware of any non-compliance with the financial debt covenants of the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ). PLC had an outstanding balance of     $385.0 million     bearing interest at a rate of     LIBOR     plus     1.00%     as     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ). As of June 30, 2016 (  Successor Company  ), the Company had used     $30.0 million     of borrowing capacity by executing a Letter of Credit under the Credit Facility for the benefit on an affiliated captive reinsurance subs  idiary of the Company. This Letter of Credit was terminated during the period and no Letter of Credit was outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  Non-Recourse     Funding Obligations 
    
  Golden Gate Captive Insurance Company 
    
  On January 15, 2016, Golden Gate Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate ), a Vermont special purpose financial insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Steel City, LLC ( Steel City ), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of PLC, entered into an   18  -year transaction to finance   $2.188 billion   of  XXX  reserves related to the acquired GLAIC Block and the other term life insurance business reinsured to Golden Gate by the Company and WCL, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Steel City issued notes (the "Steel City Notes") with an aggregate initial principal amount of   $2.188 billion   to Golden Gate in exchange for a surplus note issued by Golden Gate with an initial principal amount of   $2.188 billion  . Through the structure, Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (Bermuda) Ltd., The Canada Life Assurance Company (Barbados Branch) and Nomura Americas Re Ltd. (collectively, the  Risk-Takers ) provide credit enhancement to the Steel City Notes for the   18  -year term in exchange for credit enhancement fees. The transaction is  non-recourse  to PLC, WCL and the Company, meaning that none of these companies, other than Golden Gate, are liable to reimburse the Risk-Takers for any credit enhancement payments required to be made. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the aggregate principal balance of the Steel City Notes   was     $2.135 billion  . In connection with this transaction, PLC has entered into certain support agreements under which it guarantees or otherwise supports certain obligations of Golden Gate or Steel City. The support agreements provide that amounts would become payable by PLC if Golden Gate s annual general corporate expenses were higher than modeled amounts, certain reinsurance rates applicable to the subject business increase beyond modeled amounts or in the event write-downs due to other-than-temporary impairments on assets held in certain accounts exceed defined threshold levels. Additionally, PLC  

Table of Contents  

has entered into a separate agreement to guarantee payment of certain fee amounts in connection with the credit enhancement of the Steel City Notes. As of     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company),     no     payments have been made under these agreements. 
    
  In connection with the transaction outlined above, Golden Gate had a   $2.135 billion   outstanding non-recourse funding obligation as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). This non-recourse funding obligation matures in 2034 and accrues interest at a fixed annual rate of   4.75%  . 
       
  Prior to this transaction Golden Gate had   three   series of non-recourse funding obligations with a total outstanding balance of   $800 million  . PLC held the entire outstanding balance of non-recourse funding obligations. Series A1 non-recourse funding obligations had a balance of   $400 million   and accrued interest at   7.375%  , the Series A2 non-recourse funding obligations had a balance of   $100 million   and accrued interest at   8.00%  , and the Series A3 non-recourse funding obligations had a balance of   $300 million   and accrued interest at   8.45%  . As a result of the transaction described above, the   $800 million   of Golden Gate Series A Surplus Notes held by PLC were contributed to the Company and then subsequently contributed to Golden Gate, which resulted in the extinguishment of these notes. The contribution of the non-recourse funding obligations from PLC to the Company, and the subsequent contribution of the obligations by the Company to Golden Gate, was recognized based on the respective carrying value of the obligations, which was approximately   $1.15 billion  . This carrying value included a premium over the outstanding principal balance of the no  te issuances due to the effect of purchase accounting applied as a result of the Merger on February 1, 2015. As of the transaction date, the respective carrying value of the non-recourse funding obligation asset previously held by PLC was also approximately     $1.15 billion  ; therefore this transaction did not result in the recognition of a gain or loss for PLC or the Company. 
    
    Golden Gate II Captive Insurance Company 
    
  Golden Gate II Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate II ), a South Carolina special purpose financial captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary, had   $575 million   of outstanding non-recourse funding obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). These outstanding non-recourse funding obligations were issued to special purpose trusts, which in turn issued securities to third parties. Certain of our affiliates own a portion of these securities. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), securities related to   $58.6 million   of the outstanding balance of the non-recourse funding obligations were held by external parties, securities related to   $220.3 million   of the non-recourse funding obligations were held by nonconsolidated affiliates, and   $296.1 million   were held by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. PLC has entered into certain support agreements with Golden Gate II obligating it to make capital contributions or provide support related to certain of Golden Gate II s expenses and in certain circumstances, to collateralize certain of PLC s obligations to Golden Gate II. These support agreements provide that amounts would become payable by PLC to Golden Gate II if its annual general corporate expenses were higher than modeled amounts or if Golden Gate II s investment income on certain investments or premium income was below certain actuarially determined amounts. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been made under these agreements; however, certain support agreement obligations to Golden Gate II of approximately   $1.5 million   have been collateralized by PLC. Re-evaluation and, if necessary, adjustments of any support agreement collateralization amounts occur annually during the first quarter pursuant to the terms of the support agreements.  There are no support agreements between the Company and Golden Gate II. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the Company and its affiliates repurchased   $11.3 million   of its outstanding non-recourse funding obligations, at a discount. These repurchases did not result in a material gain or loss for the Company. During the period of February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015 (Successor Company) and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company), the Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding non-recourse funding obligations. 
    
  Golden Gate V Vermont Captive Insurance Company 
    
  On October 10, 2012, Golden Gate V Vermont Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate V ), a Vermont special purpose financial insurance company and Red Mountain, LLC ( Red Mountain ), both wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a   20  -year transaction to finance up to   $945 million   of  AXXX  reserves related to a block of universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees issued by the Company and its subsidiary, West Coast Life Insurance Company ( WCL ). Golden Gate V issued non-recourse funding obligations to Red Mountain, and Red Mountain issued a note with an initial principal amount of   $275 million  , increasing to a maximum of   $945 million   in 2027, to Golden Gate V for deposit to a reinsurance trust supporting Golden Gate V s obligations under a reinsurance agreement with WCL, pursuant to which WCL cedes liabilities relating to the policies of WCL and retrocedes liabilities relating to the policies of the Company. Through the structure, Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America ( Hannover Re ), the ultimate risk taker in the transaction, provides credit enhancement to the Red Mountain note for the   20  -year term in exchange for a fee. The transaction is  non-recourse  to Golden Gate V, Red Mountain, WCL, PLC, and the Company, meaning that none of these companies are liable for the reimbursement of any credit enhancement payments required to be made. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the principal balance of the Red Mountain note was   $550 million  . Future scheduled capital contributions to prefund credit enhancement fees amount to approximately   $134.2 million   and will be paid in annual installments through 2031. In connection with the transaction, PLC has entered into certain support agreements under which PLC guarantees or otherwise supports certain obligations of Golden Gate V or Red Mountain. The support agreements provide that amounts would become payable by PLC if Golden Gate V s annual general corporate expenses were higher than modeled amounts or in the event write-downs due to other-than-temporary impairments on assets held in certain accounts exceed defined threshold levels. Additionally, PLC has entered into separate agreements to indemnify Golden Gate V with respect to material adverse changes in non-guaranteed elements of insurance policies reinsured by Golden Gate V, and to guarantee payment of certain fee amounts in connection with the credit enhancement of the Red Mountain note. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been made under these agreements.

  Golden Gate III Vermont Captive Insurance Company 
    
       Golden Gate III Vermont Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate III ), a Vermont special purpose financial insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary, is party to a Reimbursement Agreement (the  Reimbursement Agreement ) with UBS AG, Stamford Branch ( UBS ), as issuing lender. Under the original Reimbursement Agreement, dated April 23, 2010, UBS issued a letter of credit (the  LOC ) in the initial amount of   $505 million   to a trust for the benefit of WCL. The Reimbursement Agreement was subsequently amended and restated effective November 21, 2011 (the  First Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement ), to replace the existing LOC with one or more letters of credit from UBS, and to extend the maturity date from April 1, 2018, to April 1, 2022. On August 7, 2013, Golden Gate III entered into a Second Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement with UBS (the  Second Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement ), which amended and restated the First Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. Under the Second and Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement a new LOC in an initial amount of   $710 million   was issued by UBS in replacement of the existing LOC issued under the First Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. The term of the LOC was extended from April 1, 2022 to October 1, 2023, subject to certain conditions being satisfied including scheduled capital contributions being made to Golden Gate III by one of its affiliates. The maximum stated amount of the LOC was increased from   $610 million   to   $720 million   in   2016   if certain conditions had been met. On June 25, 2014, Golden Gate III entered into a Third Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement with UBS (the  Third Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement ), which amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. Under the Third Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement, a new LOC in an initial amount of   $915 million   was issued by UBS in replacement of the existing LOC issued under the Second Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. The term of the LOC was extended from October 1, 2023 to April 1, 2025, subject to certain conditions being satisfied including scheduled capital contributions being made to Golden Gate III by one of its affiliates. The maximum stated amount of the LOC was increased from   $720 million   to   $935 million   in 2015. The LOC is held in trust for the benefit of WCL, and supports certain obligations of Golden Gate III to WCL under an indemnity reinsurance agreement originally effective April 1, 2010, as amended and restated on November 21, 2011, and as further amended and restated on August 7, 2013 and on June 25, 2014 to include additional blocks of policies, and pursuant to which WCL cedes liabilities relating to the policies of WCL and retroc  edes liabilities relating to the policies of the Company. The LOC balance reached its scheduled peak amount of     $935 million   in 2015 and remained at this level as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). The term of the LOC is expected to be approximately   15 years   from the original issuance date. This transaction is  non-recourse  to WCL, PLC, and the Company, meaning that none of these companies other than Golden Gate III are liable for reimbursement on a draw of the LOC. PLC has entered into certain support agreements with Gol  den Gate III obligating PLC to make capital contributions or provide support related to certain of Golden Gate III s expenses and in certain circumstances, to collateralize certain of PLC s obligations to Golden Gate III. Future scheduled capital contributions amount to approximately     $122.5 million     and will be paid in     three     installments with the last payment occurring in 2021, and these contributions may be subject to potential offset against dividend payments as permitted under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. The support agreements provide that amounts would become payable by PLC to Golden Gate III if Golden Gate III s annual general corporate expenses were higher than modeled amounts or if specified catastrophic losses occur during defined time periods with respect to the policies reinsured by Golden Gate III. Pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated letter agreement with UBS, PLC has continued to guarantee the payment of fees to UBS as specified in the Third Amended and Restated Reimbursement Agreement. As of     September 30, 2016     (  Successor Company  ),     no     payments have been made under these agreements.

Golden Gate IV Vermont Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate IV ), a Vermont special purpose financial insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary, is party to a Reimbursement Agreement with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as issuing lender. Under the Reimbursement Agreement, dated December 10, 2010, UBS issued an LOC in the initial amount of   $270 million   to a trust for the benefit of WCL. The LOC balance, in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, reached its scheduled peak amount of   $790 million   during the second quarter of 2016 and remained at this level as of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). The term of the LOC is expected to be   12 years   from the original issuance date (stated maturity of December 30, 2022). The LOC was issued to support certain obligations of Golden Gate IV to WCL under an indemnity reinsurance agreement, pursuant to which WCL cedes liabilities relating to the policies of WCL and retrocedes liabilities relating to the policies of the Company. This transaction is  non-recourse  to WCL, PLC, and the Company, meaning that none of these companies other than Golden Gate IV are liable for reimbursement on a draw of the LOC.

As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ),   no   payments have been made under these agreements. 
    
  Repurchase Program Borrowings 
    
  While the Company anticipates that the cash flows of its operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet its investment commitments and operating cash needs in a normal credit market environment, the Company recognizes that investment commitments scheduled to be funded may, from time to time, exceed the funds then available. Therefore, the Company has established repurchase agreement programs for certain of its insurance subsidiaries to provide liquidity when needed. The Company expects that the rate received on its investments will equal or exceed its borrowing rate. Under this program, the Company may, from time to time, sell an investment security at a specific price and agree to repurchase that security at another specified price at a later date. These borrowings are typically for a term less than   90 days  . The market value of securities to be repurchased is monitored and collateral levels are adjusted where appropriate to protect the counterparty against credit exposure. Cash received is invested in fixed maturity securities, and the agreements provided for net settlement in the event of default or on termination of the agreements. As of   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the fair value of securities pledged under the repurchase program was   $224.8 million   and the repurchase obligation of   $219.5 million   was included in the Company s consolidated condensed balance sheets (at an average borrowing rate of   43   basis points). During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the maximum balance outstanding at any one point in time related to these programs was   $725.0 million  . The average daily balance was   $453.0 million   (at an average borrowing rate of   41   basis points) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ). As of   December 31, 2015   (Successor Company), the fair value of securities pledged under the repurchase program was   $479.9 million   and the repurchase obligation of   $438.2 million   was included in the Company's consolidated condensed balance sheets. During   2015  , the maximum balance outstanding at any one point in time related to these programs was   $912.7 million  . The average daily balance was   $540.3 million   and   $77.4 million   (at an average borrowing rate of   20   and   16   basis points) during the period of February 1, 2015 to   December 31, 2015   (Successor Company) and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (  Predecessor Company  ).

Under insurance guaranty fund laws, in most states insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. In addition, from time to time, companies may be asked to contribute amounts beyond prescribed limits. Most insurance guaranty fund laws provide that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer s own financial strength. The Company does not believe its insurance guaranty fund assessments will be materially different from amounts already provided for in the financial statements. 
    
  A number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers, broker-dealers and other providers of financial services involving sales, refund or claims practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise representatives, relationships with agents or persons with whom the insurer does business, and other matters. Often these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive and non-economic compensatory damages. In some states, juries, judges, and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive non-economic compensatory damages which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration. Arbitration awards are subject to very limited appellate review. In addition, in some class action and other lawsuits, companies have made material settlement payments. Public companies in general and the financial services and insurance industries in particular are also sometimes the target of law enforcement and regulatory investigations relating to the numerous laws and regulations that govern such companies. Some companies have been the subject of law enforcement or regulatory actions or other actions resulting from such investigations. The Company, in the ordinary course of business, is involved in such matters. 
    
  The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory actions when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no liability is established. For such matters, the Company may provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly and annual basis and updates its established liabilities, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of loss based on such reviews. 
    
  In 2012, the IRS proposed favorable and unfavorable adjustments to the Company s 2003 through 2007 reported taxable income. The Company protested certain unfavorable adjustments and sought resolution at the IRS  Appeals Division. In October 2015, Appeals accepted the Company s earlier proposed settlement offer. In September 2015, the IRS proposed favorable and unfavorable adjustments to the Company s 2008 through 2011 reported taxable income. The Company agreed to these adjustments. As a result, pending a routine review by Congress  Joint Committee on Taxation, the Company expects to receive an approximate   $6.2 million     ne  t tax refund in a future period. This refund will not materially affect the Company s effective tax rate. 
    
  Certain of the Company s insurance subsidiaries, as well as certain other insurance companies for which the Company has coinsured blocks of life insurance and annuity policies, are under audit for compliance with the unclaimed property laws of a number of states. The audits are being conducted on behalf of the treasury departments or unclaimed property administrators in such states. The focus of the audits is on whether there have been unreported deaths, maturities, or policies that have exceeded limiting age with respect to which death benefits or other payments under life insurance or annuity policies should be treated as unclaimed property that should be escheated to the state. The Company is presently unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from the audits due to a number of factors, including uncertainty as to the legal theory or theories that may give rise to liability, the early stages of the audits being conducted, and, with respect to one block of life insurance policies that is co-insured by a subsidiary of the Company, uncertainty as to whether the Company or other companies are responsible for the liabilities, if any, arising in connection with such policies. The Company will continue to monitor the matter for any developments that would make the loss contingency associated with the audits reasonably estimable. 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are under a targeted multi-state examination with respect to their claims paying practices and their use of the U.S. Social Security Administration s Death Master File or similar databases (a  Death Database ) to identify unreported deaths in their life insurance policies, annuity contracts and retained asset accounts. There is no clear basis in previously existing law for requiring a life insurer to search for unreported deaths in order to determine whether a benefit is owed, and substantial legal authority exists to support the position that the prevailing industry practice was lawful. A number of life insurers, however, have entered into settlement or consent agreements with state insurance regulators under which the life insurers agreed to implement procedures for periodically comparing their life insurance and annuity contracts and retained asset accounts against a Death Database, treating confirmed deaths as giving rise to a death benefit under their policies, locating beneficiaries and paying them the benefits and interest, escheating the benefits and interest to the state if the beneficiary could not be found, and paying penalties to the state, if required. It has been publicly reported that the life insurers have paid administrative and/or examination fees to the insurance regulators in connection with the settlement or consent agreements. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that insurance regulators could demand from the Company administrative and/or examination fees relating to the targeted multi-state examination. Based on publicly reported payments by other life insurers, the Company estimates the range of such fees to be from   $0   to   $4.5 million  .

  Beginning with the December 31, 2015 measurement, PLC changed its method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying a spot rate approach.  Historically, PLC utilized a single weighted average discount rate derived from a selected yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation as of the measurement date.  Under the new spot rate approach, the actual calculation of service and interest cost will reflect an array of spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. PLC made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot rates from the selected yield curve. This new approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. 

Table of Contents  

Components of the net periodic benefit cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of   February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), and the period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ), are as follows:  

On May 5, 2016, the Board of Directors of Protective Life Corporation decided to convert the accrued benefit payable under the excess benefit plan as of March 31, 2016 to John D. Johns, PLC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, into a lump sum amount. On September 30, 2016, the lump sum amount was allocated to a book entry account that will be treated as though it were a deferral account under PLC s deferred compensation plan for officers. Mr. Johns will continue to accrue benefits with respect to his continued service as an employee of PLC after March 31, 2016 in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the excess benefit plan. The conversion event required PLC to re-measure the excess benefit plan as of May 31, 2016 and resulted in the recognition of   $2.1 million     in set  tlement expense during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), PLC contributed   $1.9 million   to its defined benefit pension plan for the 2015 plan year. PLC will make contributions in future periods as necessary to at least satisfy minimum funding requirements. PLC may also make additional contributions in future periods to maintain an adjusted funding target attainment percentage ( AFTAP ) of at least   80%   and to avoid certain Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) reporting triggers.

16.                                     INCOME TAXES 
    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

In 2012, the IRS proposed favorable and unfavorable adjustments to the Company's 2003 through 2007 reported taxable income. The Company protested certain unfavorable adjustments and sought resolution at the IRS' Appeals Division. In October 2015, Appeals accepted the Company's earlier proposed settlement offer. In September 2015, the IRS proposed favorable and unfavorable adjustments to the Company's 2008 through 2011 reported taxable income. The Company agreed to these adjustments. The resulting net adjustment to the Company's current income taxes for the years 2003 through 2011 will not materially affect the Company or its effective tax rate. 
    
  In July 2016, the IRS proposed favorable and unfavorable adjustments to the Company's 2012 and 2013 reported taxable income. The Company agreed to these adjustments. The resulting settlement paid in September 2016 did not materially impact the Company or its effective tax rate. 
    
  These agreements with the IRS are the primary cause for the reductions of unrecognized tax benefits shown in the chart above. The Company believes that in the next 12 months,   none   of the unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 will be reduced. 
    
  In general, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for tax years that began before 2013. Nevertheless, certain of these pre-2013 years have pending U.S. tax refunds. Due to their size, these refunds are being reviewed by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned IRS adjustments to the Company's pre-2013 taxable income, the Company is amending certain of its 2003 through 2013 state income tax returns. Such amendments will cause such years to remain open, pending the states' acceptances of the returns. At this time, the Company believes that the Joint Committee's review of its U.S. tax refunds and the states' acceptance of its amending returns will be completed next year. The underlying statutes of limitations are expected to close in due course on or before December 31, 2017. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), the Company entered into a reinsurance transaction, as discussed in Note 3,   Reinsurance and Financing Transactions  . This transaction is expected to generate an operating loss on the Company s consolidated 2016 US income tax return. The Company has evaluated its ability to carry this loss back to receive refunds of previously-paid taxes, plus utilize the remaining loss in future years. The Company expects to receive refunds for substantially all of the US income taxes that it paid in 2014 and 2015, as well as fully utilize the remaining operating loss carryforward during the carryforward period. Based on the Company s current assessment of future taxable income, including available tax planning opportunities, the Company anticipates that it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of its material deferred tax assets. The Company did not record a valuation allowance against its material deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  The Company used its respective estimates of its annual 2016 and 2015 incomes in computing its effective income tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of February 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company). The effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of February 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company) were   22.2%  ,   31.4%  ,   27.3%  ,   28.0%  , and   32.8%  , respectively.  

17.                                     OPERATING     SEGMENTS 
    
  The Company has several operating segments, each having a strategic focus. An operating segment is distinguished by products, channels of distribution, and/or other strategic distinctions. The Company periodically evaluates its operating segments, as prescribed in the ASC Segment Reporting Topic, and makes adjustments to its segment reporting as needed. There were no  

Table of Contents  

changes to the Company s operating segments made or required to be made as a result of the Merger on February 1, 2015. A brief description of each segment follows. 

The Life Marketing segment markets fixed universal life ( UL ), indexed universal life ("IUL"), variable universal life ( VUL ), bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI ), and level premium term insurance ( traditional ) products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers, broker-dealers, financial institutions, independent marketing organizations, and affinity groups. 

The Acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies acquired from other companies. The segment s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals. The level of the segment s acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors, including available capital, operating capacity, potential return on capital, and market dynamics. Policies acquired through the Acquisitions segment are typically blocks of business where no new policies are being marketed. Therefore earnings and account values are expected to decline as the result of lapses, deaths, and other terminations of coverage unless new acquisitions are made. 

The Annuities segment markets fixed and VA products. These products are primarily sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions, and independent agents and brokers. 

The Stable Value Products segment sells fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, money market funds, bank trust departments, and other institutional investors. This segment also issues funding agreements to the FHLB, and markets guaranteed investment contracts ( GICs ) to 401(k) and other qualified retirement savings plans. The Company also has an unregistered funding agreement-backed notes program which provides for offers of notes to both domestic and international institutional investors.  

The Asset Protection segment markets extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers  investments in automobiles and recreational vehicles. In addition, the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ) product. GAP coverage covers the difference between the loan pay-off amount and an asset s actual cash value in the case of a total loss. 

The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net investment income on assets supporting our equity capital, unallocated corporate overhead and expenses not attributable to the segments above. This segment includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, various investment-related transactions, the operations of several small subsidiaries, and the repurchase of non-recourse funding obligations. 
       
       The Company's management and PLC's Board of Directors analyzes and assesses the operating performance of each segment using "pre-tax operating income (loss)". Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, pre-tax operating income (loss) is the Company's measure of segment performance. Pre-tax operating income (loss) is calculated by adjusting  "income (loss) before income tax," by excluding the following items: 

realized gains and losses on investments and derivatives,  
                
    changes in the GMWB embedded derivatives exclusive of the portion attributable to the economic cost of the GMWB,  
                
    actual GMWB incurred claims, and  
                
    the amortization of DAC, VOBA, and certain policy liabilities that is impacted by the exclusion of these items.  
       
  These items are important to understanding the overall results of operations. Pre-tax operating income (loss) is not a substitute for net income (loss), and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that pre-tax operating income (loss) enhances management's and the Board of Directors' understanding of the ongoing operations, the underlying profitability of each segment, and helps facilitate the allocation of resources. 
    
  In determining the components of the pre-tax operating income (loss) for each segment, premiums and policy fees, other income, benefits and settlement expenses, and amortization of DAC and VOBA are attributed directly to each operating segment. Net investment income is allocated based on directly related assets required for transacting the business of that segment. Realized investment gains (losses) and other operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner that most appropriately reflects the operations of that segment. Investments and other assets are allocated based on statutory policy liabilities net of associated statutory policy assets, while DAC/VOBA and goodwill are shown in the segments to which they are attributable. 
    
  There were no significant intersegment transactions during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  Successor Company  ), the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company), the period of   February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   (  Successor Company  ), and the period of   January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015   (  Predecessor Company  ).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
    
  On January 15, 2016, we completed the transaction contemplated by the Master Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 (the  Master Agreement ), with Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company ( GLAIC ), as previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed October 1, 2015 and January 15, 2016. Pursuant to the Master Agreement, effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a reinsurance agreement (the  Reinsurance Agreement ) under the terms of which we coinsure certain term life insurance business of GLAIC (the  GLAIC Block ). In connection with the reinsurance transaction, on January 15, 2016, Golden Gate Captive Insurance Company ( Golden Gate ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Steel City, LLC ( Steel City ), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of PLC, entered into an 18-year transaction to finance $2.188 billion of  XXX  reserves related to the acquired GLAIC Block and the other term life insurance business reinsured to Golden Gate by the Company and West Coast Life Insurance Company ( WCL ), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Steel City issued notes with an aggregate initial principal amount of $2.188 billion to Golden Gate in exchange for a surplus note issued by Golden Gate with an initial principal amount of $2.188 billion. Through the structure, Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (Bermuda) Ltd., The Canada Life Assurance Company (Barbados Branch) and Nomura Americas Re Ltd. (collectively, the  Risk-Takers ) provide credit enhancement to the Steel City notes for the 18-year term in exchange for credit enhancement fees. The transaction is  non-recourse  to PLC, WCL and the Company, meaning that none of these companies are liable to reimburse the Risk-Takers for any credit enhancement payments required to be made. In connection with the transaction, PLC has entered into certain support agreements under which it guarantees or otherwise supports certain obligations of Golden Gate or Steel City, including a guarantee of the fees to the Risk-Takers. The estimated average annual expense of the credit enhancement under generally accepted accounting principles is approximately $3.1 million, after-tax. As a result of the financing transaction described above, the $800 million of Golden Gate Series A Surplus Notes held by PLC were contributed to the Company and then subsequently contributed to Golden Gate, which resulted in the extinguishment of these notes. Also on January 15, 2016, Golden Gate paid an extraordinary dividend of $300 million to the Company as approved by the Vermont Department of Regulation. 
    
  In August 2016, PLC reached an agreement through the Company to acquire USWC Holding Company and its affiliated operating subsidiaries ("USWC") via a stock purchase agreement (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition is subject to receipt of standard regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. USWC, whose primary operating subsidiary is United States Warranty Corp., currently markets vehicle service contracts, GAP coverage, and a suite of ancillary automotive maintenance and protection products nationwide. The Acquisition is expected to provide the combined entities with expanded market reach, enhanced product and operational capabilities, and higher collective growth potential.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our accounting policies require the use of judgments relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses, and interest rates, as well as expectations around the valuations of securities. Because of the inherent uncertainty when using the assumptions and estimates, the effect of certain accounting policies under different conditions or assumptions could be materially different from those reported in the consolidated condensed financial statements. For a complete listing of our critical accounting policies, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (Successor Company).  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Our management and PLC's Board of Directors analyzes and assesses the operating performance of each segment using "pre-tax operating income (loss)". Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, pre-tax operating income (loss) is our measure of segment performance. Pre-tax operating income (loss) is calculated by adjusting "income (loss) before income tax," by excluding the following items: 

realized gains and losses on investments and derivatives,  
                
    changes in the GMWB embedded derivatives exclusive of the portion attributable to the economic cost of the GMWB,  
                
    actual GMWB incurred claims, and  
                
    the amortization of DAC, VOBA, and certain policy liabilities that is impacted by the exclusion of these items.  
       
  These items are important to understanding the overall results of operations. Pre-tax operating income (loss) is not a substitute for net income (loss), and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our belief is that pre-tax operating income (loss) enhances management's and the Board of Directors' understanding of the ongoing operations, the underlying profitability of each segment, and helps facilitate the allocation of resources. 
    
  In determining the components of the pre-tax operating income (loss) for each segment, premiums and policy fees, other income, benefits and settlement expenses, and amortization of DAC and VOBA are attributed directly to each operating segment. Net investment income is allocated based on directly related assets required for transacting the business of that segment. Realized investment gains (losses) and other operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner that most appropriately reflects the operations of that segment. Investments and other assets are allocated based on statutory policy liabilities net of associated statutory policy assets, while DAC/VOBA and goodwill are shown in the segments to which they are attributable. 
    
  We periodically review and update as appropriate our key assumptions used to measure certain balances related to insurance products, including future mortality, expenses, lapses, premium persistency, benefit utilization, investment yields, interest rates, and equity market returns. Changes to these assumptions result in adjustments which increase or decrease DAC and VOBA amortization and/or benefits and expenses. The periodic review and updating of assumptions is referred to as  unlocking . When referring to unlocking the reference is to changes in all balance sheet components amortized over estimated gross profits or revenues.

  Net income was $73.3 million and pre-tax operating income was $85.0 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We experienced net realized gains of $21.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The gains realized were primarily related to $1.7 million of gains related to investment securities sale activity, $13.4 million of gains related to the derivatives with PLC, net gains of $8.1 million of derivatives related to variable annuity contracts, and net gains of $8.8 million of derivatives related to IUL contracts.

Life Marketing     segment     pre-tax     operating loss was $0.5 million for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , representing a decrease of $19.3 million from the three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the impact of prospective unlocking during the current quarter and unfavorable traditional mortality. The segment recorded an unfavorable $18.3 million of prospective unlocking for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to an unfavorable $2.3 million of prospective unlocking for th three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

The increase in operating earnings primarily resulted from increased average account values and other income offset by a decrease in participating mortgage income and lower operating spreads. Participating mortgage income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.3 million as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The adjusted operating spread, which excludes participating income and other income, decreased by 45 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the prior year, due primarily to an increase in credited interest.

  Pre-tax operating income (loss) 
    
  Pre-tax operating loss was $0.5 million for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , representing a decrease of $19.3 million from the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .     The decrease was primarily due to the impact of prospective unlocking during the current quarter and unfavorable traditional mortality. The segment recorded an unfavorable $18.3 million of prospective unlocking for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an unfavorable $2.3 million of prospective unlocking for the three months ended September 30,     2015. 
    
  Operating revenues 
    
  Total operating revenues for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , increased $10.5 million, or 3.0%, as compared to the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .     This increase was driven by higher investment income due to increases in net in-force reserves and yields. 
    
  Net premiums and policy fees 
    
  Net premiums and policy fees increased by $1.0 million, or 0.4%, for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,     due to an increase in policy fees associated with continued growth in universal life business. This increase is almost entirely offset by a decrease in traditional life premiums. 
    
  Net investment income 
    
  Net investment income in the segment increased $9.3 million, or 7.6%, for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .     Of the increase in net investment income, $5.8 million was the result of an increase in universal life due to higher yields and universal life reserves. Traditional life investment income increased $2.8 million primarily due to lower funding costs and higher yields. 
    
  Other income 
    
  Other income increased $0.3 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to fees on variable universal life funds.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, universal life and BOLI prospective unlocking increased policy benefits and settlement expenses $20.5 million, as compared to an increase of $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Unlocking in 2016 was largely driven by assumption changes to reinsurance and yields. Assumption changes to lapses and yields contributed to the unlocking in 2015. 
    
  Amortization of DAC/VOBA 
    
  DAC/VOBA amortization increased $6.5 million, or 24.0%, for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,     due to higher VOBA amortization in traditional business as a result of higher lapses, partially offset by the impact of prospective unlocking. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, universal life and BOLI prospective unlocking decreased amortization $2.2 million, as compared to a decrease of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Other operating expenses 
    
  Other operating expenses decreased $3.7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .     This decrease reflects lower new business costs after capitalization and lower general and administrative expenses of $2.4 million, largely offset by higher renewal commissions of $1.3 million along with an increase in taxes, license and fees of $0.6 million. 
       
  Sales

  Reinsurance 

Table of Contents  

Currently, the Life Marketing segment reinsures significant amounts of its life insurance in-force. Pursuant to the underlying reinsurance contracts, reinsurers pay allowances to the segment as a percentage of both first year and renewal premiums. Reinsurance allowances represent the amount the reinsurer is willing to pay for reimbursement of acquisition costs incurred by the direct writer of the business. A portion of reinsurance allowances received is deferred as part of DAC and a portion is recognized immediately as a reduction of other operating expenses. As the non-deferred portion of allowances reduces operating expenses in the period received, these amounts represent a net increase to operating income during that period. 
    
  Reinsurance allowances do not affect the methodology used to amortize DAC or the period over which such DAC is amortized. However, they do affect the amounts recognized as DAC amortization. DAC on universal life-type, limited-payment long duration, and investment contracts business is amortized based on the estimated gross profits of the policies in-force. Reinsurance allowances are considered in the determination of estimated gross profits, and therefore, impact DAC amortization on these lines of business. Deferred reinsurance allowances on level term business are recorded as ceded DAC, which is amortized over estimated ceded premiums of the policies in-force. Thus, deferred reinsurance allowances may impact DAC amortization. A more detailed discussion of the components of reinsurance can be found in the Reinsurance section of Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (Successor Company).

Impact of reinsurance 
    
  Reinsurance impacted the Life Marketing segment line items as shown in the following table: 
    
  Life Marketing Segment 
  Line Item Impact of Reinsurance 

(1)   Other operating expenses ceded per the income statement are equal to reinsurance allowances recognized after capitalization. 
    
  The table above does not reflect the impact of reinsurance on our net investment income. By ceding business to the assuming companies, we forgo investment income on the reserves ceded. Conversely, the assuming companies will receive investment income on the reserves assumed, which will increase the assuming companies  profitability on the business that we cede. The net investment income impact to us and the assuming companies has not been quantified. The impact of including foregone investment income would be to substantially reduce the favorable net impact of reinsurance reflected above. We estimate that the impact of foregone investment income would be to reduce the net impact of reinsurance presented in the table above by 100% to 340%. The Life Marketing segment s reinsurance programs do not materially impact the  other income  line of our income statement. 
    
  As shown above, reinsurance had a favorable impact on the Life Marketing segment s operating income for the periods presented above. The impact of reinsurance is largely due to our quota share coinsurance program in place prior to mid-2005. Under that program, generally 90% of the segment s traditional new business was ceded to reinsurers. Since mid-2005, a much smaller percentage of overall term business has been ceded due to a change in reinsurance strategy on traditional business. In addition, since 2012, a much smaller percentage of the segment s new universal life business has been ceded. As a result of that change, the relative impact of reinsurance on the Life Marketing segment s overall results is expected to decrease over time. While the significance of reinsurance is expected to decline over time, the overall impact of reinsurance for a given period may fluctuate due to variations in mortality and unlocking of balances. 
    
  For The   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   as compared to The   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   (Successor Company) 
    
  The higher ceded premium and policy fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was caused primarily by higher ceded traditional life premiums of $18.2 million and higher universal life policy fees of $5.3 million. Ceded traditional life premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased from the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to post level activity. 

Table of Contents  

Ceded benefits and settlement expenses were higher for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher universal life ceded claims, partially offset by net decreases in ceded reserves. Traditional ceded benefits increased $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in post level ceded reserves, partially offset by lower ceded death benefits. Universal life ceded benefits increased $22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to an increase in ceded claims, partially offset by a decrease in ceded reserves. Ceded universal life claims were $33.9 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Ceded amortization of DAC and VOBA decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the differences in unlocking between the two periods. 
    
  Ceded other operating expenses reflect the impact of reinsurance allowances on net income.  
    
  For The   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company)

  For The   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   (Successor Company) 
    
  Pre-tax operating income 
    
  Pre-tax operating income was $70.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $11.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the addition of the GLAIC reinsurance transaction completed on January 15, 2016. The GLAIC transaction added $16.7 million to pre-tax operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the segment recorded favorable prospective unlocking of $1.2 million as compared to favorable $0.3 million of prospective unlocking for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

  Acquisitions Segment 
  Line Item Impact of Reinsurance 

(1)   Assumes no investment income on reinsurance. Foregone investment income would substantially reduce the favorable impact of reinsurance. 
    
  The segment s reinsurance programs do not materially impact the other income line of the income statement. In addition, net investment income generally has no direct impact on reinsurance cost. However, by ceding business to the assuming companies, we forgo investment income on the reserves ceded to the assuming companies. Conversely, the assuming companies will receive investment income on the reserves assumed which will increase the assuming companies  profitability on business assumed from the Company. For business ceded under modified coinsurance arrangements, the amount of investment income attributable to the assuming company is included as part of the overall change in policy reserves and, as such, is reflected in benefit and settlement expenses. The net investment income impact to us and the assuming companies has not been quantified as it is not fully reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The net impact of reinsurance is less favorable by $8.2 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower ceded claims. In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , ceded revenues decreased by $9.9 million, while ceded benefits and expenses decreased by $18.1 million primarily due to lower claims.  
    
  The net impact of reinsurance activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) was primarily due to ceded premiums in relation to ceded benefits and settlement expenses. Ceded benefits and settlement expenses were primarily driven by ceded claims. 
    
  The net impact of reinsurance activity for the period of February 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015   (Successor Company) was primarily due to ceded premiums in relation to ceded benefits and settlement expenses. Ceded benefits and settlement expenses were primarily driven by ceded claims.

    Pre-tax operating income 
    
  Pre-tax     operating income was $43.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared $37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $5.9 million, or 16.0%. This variance was primarily the result of lower credited interest, higher investment income, and higher fees and other income on the variable annuities ( VA ) line of business offset by unfavorable single premium immediate annuities ( SPIA ) mortality. Segment results were positively impacted by $5.7 million of favorable unlocking for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0.9 million of favorable unlocking for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Operating revenues 
    
  Segment operating revenues increased $1.2 million, or 0.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to increases in policy fees and other income from the VA line of business and increases in investment income. Those increases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the GMWB economic cost. Average fixed account balances decreased 1.2% and average variable account balances increased 0.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

  Reinsurance 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2012 (Predecessor Company), the Annuity segment began reinsuring certain risks associated with the GMWB and GMDB riders to Shades Creek Captive Insurance Company ( Shades Creek ), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PLC. The cost of reinsurance to the segment is reflected in the chart shown below. The impact of the Shades Creek reinsurance arrangement for the three month period ending March 31, 2013 was eliminated in consolidation.  Prior to April 1, 2013, we paid as a dividend all of Shades Creek s outstanding common stock to its parent, PLC.

These arrangements are coinsurance contracts ceding the business on a first dollar quota share basis at 100% to limit our exposure and allow the PARCs to share in the underwriting income of the product. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to our policyholders. A more detailed discussion of the components of reinsurance can be found in the Reinsurance section of Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (Successor Company).

CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), our investment portfolio was approximately $51.6 billion. The types of assets in which we may invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. Within the parameters of these laws, we invest in assets giving consideration to such factors as liquidity and capital needs, investment quality, investment return, matching of assets and liabilities, and the overall composition of the investment portfolio by asset type and credit exposure. 
    
  The following table presents the reported values of our invested assets:  

Included in the preceding table are $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion of fixed maturities and $25.7 million and $61.7 million of short-term investments classified as trading securities as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), respectively. All of the fixed maturities in the trading portfolio are invested assets that are held pursuant to modified coinsurance ( Modco ) arrangements under which the economic risks and benefits of the investments are passed to third party reinsurers. Also included above are $2.8 billion and $593.3 million of securities classified as held-to-maturity as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), respectively.  

Fixed Maturity Investments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), our fixed maturity investment holdings were approximately $42.2 billion. The approximate percentage distribution of our fixed maturity investments by quality rating is as follows:  

We use various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations  ( NRSRO ) ratings when classifying securities by quality ratings. When the various NRSRO ratings are not consistent for a security, we use the second-highest convention in

assigning the rating. When there are no such published ratings, we assign a rating based on the statutory accounting rating system if such ratings are available. 
    
  We do not have material exposure to financial guarantee insurance companies with respect to our investment portfolio. 
    
  Changes in fair value for our available-for-sale portfolio, net of tax and the related impact on certain insurance assets and liabilities are recorded directly to shareowner s equity. Declines in fair value that are other-than-temporary are recorded as realized losses in the consolidated condensed statements of income, net of any applicable non-credit component of the loss, which is recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss). 
    
  The distribution of our fixed maturity investments by type is as follows:  

Table of Contents  

The industry segment composition of our fixed maturity securities is presented in the following table: 

Within our fixed maturity investments, we maintain portfolios classified as  available-for-sale ,  trading , and  held-to-maturity . We purchase our available-for-sale investments with the intent to hold to maturity by purchasing investments that match future cash flow needs. However, we may sell any of our available-for-sale and trading investments to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, we classified $36.6 billion, or 86.8%, of our fixed maturities as  available-for-sale  as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). These securities are carried at fair value on our consolidated condensed balance sheets. 
    
  Fixed maturities with respect to which we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as  held-to-maturity . We classified $2.8 billion, or 6.6%, of our fixed maturities as  held-to-maturity  as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). These securities are carried at amortized cost on our consolidated condensed balance sheets.

Our trading portfolio accounted for $2.8 billion, or 6.6%, of our fixed maturities and $25.7 million of short-term investments as of     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company). Changes in fair value on the Modco trading portfolio, including gains and losses from sales, are passed to the reinsurers through the contractual terms   of the reinsurance arrangements. Partially offsetting these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. The total Modco trading portfolio fixed maturities by rating is as follows: 

A portion of our bond portfolio is invested in residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), and other asset-backed securities (collectively referred to as asset-backed securities or  ABS ). ABS are securities that are backed by a pool of assets. These holdings as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), were approximately $5.5 billion. Mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) are constructed from pools of mortgages and may have cash flow volatility as a result of changes in the rate at which prepayments of principal occur with respect to the underlying loans. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, prepayments of principal on the underlying loans can be expected to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in interest rates.

The majority of our RMBS holdings as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) were super senior or senior bonds in the capital structure. Our total non-agency portfolio has a weighted-average lif  e of 5.0 years. Th  e following table categorizes the weighted-average life for our non-agency portfolio, by category of material holdings, as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company): 

Our investments classified as available-for-sale and trading in debt and equity securities are reported at fair value. Our investments classified as held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. As of     September 30, 2016     (Successor Company), our fixed maturity investments (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) had a fair value of $42.2 billion, which was 0.5% below amortized cost of $42.4 billion. These assets are invested for terms approximately corresponding to anticipated future benefit payments. Thus, market fluctuations are not expected to adversely affect liquidity. 
    
  Fair values for private, non-traded securities are determined as follows: 1) we obtain estimates from independent pricing services and 2) we estimate fair value based upon a comparison to quoted issues of the same issuer or issues of other issuers with similar terms and risk characteristics. We analyze the independent pricing services valuation methodologies and related inputs, including an assessment of the observability of market inputs. Upon obtaining this information related to fair value, management makes a determination as to the appropriate valuation amount.

Mortgage Loans 
    
  We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in commercial mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), our mortgage loan holdings were approximately $5.9 billion. We have specialized in making loans on either credit-oriented commercial properties or credit-anchored strip shopping centers and apartments. Our underwriting procedures relative to our commercial loan portfolio are based, in our view, on a conservative and disciplined approach. We concentrate on a small number of commercial real estate asset types associated with the necessities of life (retail, multi-family, senior living, professional office buildings, and warehouses). We believe that these asset types tend to weather economic downturns better than other commercial asset classes in which we have chosen not to participate. We believe this disciplined approach has helped to maintain a relatively low delinquency and foreclosure rate throughout our history. The majority of our mortgage loans portfolio was underwritten and funded by us. From time to time, we may acquire loans in conjunction with an acquisition. 
    
  Our commercial mortgage loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, and net of valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan s contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums and discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest income, amortization of premiums and discounts, and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. 
    
  Certain of the mortgage loans have call options that occur within the next 12 years. However, if interest rates were to significantly increase, we may be unable to exercise the call options on our existing mortgage loans commensurate with the significantly increased market rates. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), assuming the loans are called at their next call dates, approximately $28.1 million of principal would become due for the remainder of 2016, $972.7 million in 2017 through 2021, $235.0 million in 2022 through 2026, and $11.0 million thereafter. 
       
  We offer a type of commercial mortgage loan under which we will permit a loan-to-value ratio of up to 85% in exchange for a participating interest in the cash flows from the underlying real estate. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company) and December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), approximately $549.2 million and $449.2 million, respectively, of our total mortgage loans principal balance have this participation feature. Cash flows received as a result of this participation feature are recorded as interest income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), the three months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor Company), the period of February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015 (Successor Company), and January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company), we recognized $3.3 million, $15.8 million, $3.3 million, $8.4 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, of participating mortgage loan income. 
    
  We record mortgage loans net of an allowance for credit losses. This allowance is calculated through analysis of specific loans that have indicators of potential impairment based on current information and events. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company) there were $3.4 million of allowances for mortgage loan credit losses and as of December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), there were no allowances for mortgage loan credit losses. While our mortgage loans do not have quoted market values, as of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we estimated the fair value of our mortgage loans to be $5.9 billion (using an internal fair value model which calculates the value of most loans by using the loan's discounted cash flows to the loan's call or maturity date), which was approximately 1.0% greater than the amortized cost, less any related loan loss reserve. 
    
  At the time of origination, our mortgage lending criteria targets that the loan-to-value ratio on each mortgage is 75% or less. We target projected rental payments from credit anchors (i.e., excluding rental payments from smaller local tenants) of 70% of the property s projected operating expenses and debt service. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), approximately $1.0 million of invested assets consisted of nonperforming mortgage loans, restructured mortgage loans, or mortgage loans that were foreclosed and were converted to real estate properties. We do not expect these investments to adversely affect our liquidity or ability to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we did not enter into any mortgage loan transactions that would have been accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. For all mortgage loans, the impact of troubled debt restructurings is generally reflected in our investment balance and in the allowance for mortgage loan credit losses. If we had troubled debt restructurings, these transactions would include either the acceptance of assets in satisfaction of principal during the respective periods or at a future date and were the result of agreements between the creditor and the debtor. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we did not accept or agree to accept assets in satisfaction of principal. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we did not have any mortgage loan transactions accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. 
    
  Our mortgage loan portfolio consists of two categories of loans: 1) those not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement and 2) those subject to a contractual pooling and servicing agreement. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), $1.0 million of mortgage loans not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement were nonperforming mortgage loans, restructured, or mortgage loans that were foreclosed and were converted to real estate properties. We foreclosed on $1.0 million of nonperforming loans not subject to a pooling and servicing agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company).  
    
  As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), none of the loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement were nonperforming or restructured. We did not foreclose on any nonperforming loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company). 
    
  We do not expect these investments to adversely affect our liquidity or ability to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities.

It is our policy to cease to carry accrued interest on loans that are over 90 days delinquent. For loans less than 90 days delinquent, interest is accrued unless it is determined that the accrued interest is not collectible. If a loan becomes over 90 days delinquent, it is our general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current is in place. For loans subject to a pooling and servicing agreement, there are certain additional restrictions and/or requirements related to workout proceedings, and as such, these loans may have different attributes and/or circumstances affecting the status of delinquency or categorization of those in nonperforming status. 

Risk Management and Impairment Review 
    
  We monitor the overall credit quality of our portfolio within established guidelines. The following table includes our available-for-sale fixed maturities by credit rating as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company):  

Not included in the table above are $2.5 billion of investment grade and $266.4 million of below investment grade fixed maturities classified as trading securities and $2.8 billion of fixed maturities classified as held-to-maturity. 
    
  Limiting bond exposure to any creditor group is another way we manage credit risk. We held no credit default swaps on the positions listed below as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). The following table summarizes our ten largest maturity exposures to an individual creditor group as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company):  

Determining whether a decline in the current fair value of invested assets is an other-than-temporary decline in value is both objective and subjective, and can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for investments that are not actively traded in established markets. We review our positions on a monthly basis for possible credit concerns and review our current exposure, credit enhancement, and delinquency experience. 
    
  Management considers a number of factors when determining the impairment status of individual securities. These include the economic condition of various industry segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risks. Since it is possible for the impairment of one investment to affect other investments, we engage in ongoing risk management to safeguard against and limit any further risk to our investment portfolio. Special attention is given to correlative risks within specific industries, related parties, and business markets.

For certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, including RMBS, CMBS, and other asset-backed securities (collectively referred to as asset-backed securities or  ABS ), GAAP requires us to periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. Projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral. In addition, we consider our intent and ability to retain a temporarily depressed security until recovery. 
    
  Securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. We consider a number of factors in determining whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. These include, but are not limited to: 1) actions taken by rating agencies, 2) default by the issuer, 3) the significance of the decline, 4) an assessment of our intent to sell the security (including a more likely than not assessment of whether we will be required to sell the security) before recovering the security s amortized cost, 5) the time period during which the decline has occurred, 6) an economic analysis of the issuer s industry, and 7) the financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of the issuer. Management performs a security-by-security review each quarter in evaluating the need for any other-than-temporary impairments. Although no set formula is used in this process, the investment performance, collateral position, and continued viability of the issuer are significant measures considered, along with an analysis regarding our expectations for recovery of the security s entire amortized cost basis through the receipt of future cash flows. Based on our analysis, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we concluded that approximately $3.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, of investment securities in an unrealized loss position were other-than-temporarily impaired, due to credit related factors, resulting in a charge to earnings. Additionally, we recognized $1.4 million of non-credit gains and $3.3 million of non-credit losses in other comprehensive income (loss), respectively.  
    
  There are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in fair values are other-than-temporary. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions, commission of fraud, and legislative actions. We continuously monitor these factors as they relate to the investment portfolio in determining the status of each investment. 
    
  During 2015 and 2016, the energy and natural gas sector experienced increased volatility due to the decline in oil prices. A prolonged decline in oil prices could have a broad economic impact and put financial stress on companies in this sector. We continue to monitor our exposure to companies within and exposed to this sector closely. Our current exposure is predominantly with investment grade securities of companies with ample liquidity to weather a prolonged decline in oil prices. Many of these companies have displayed financial discipline by reducing capital expenditures to conserve cash and maintain their credit ratings.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we did not recognized an other-than-temporary impairment. 
    
  The energy and natural gas sector securities as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) are presented in the following tables.

During 2015, the metals and mining sector (a sub-sector of the basic industrial sector) experienced increased volatility due to the decline in precious and base metal prices. A prolonged decline in these prices could have a broad economic impact and put financial stress on companies in this sector. We continue to monitor our exposure to companies within and exposed to this sector closely. Our current exposure is predominantly with investment grade securities of companies with ample liquidity to weather a prolonged decline in these prices. Many of these companies have displayed financial discipline by reducing capital expenditures and reducing dividends to conserve cash and maintain their credit ratings.

We have deposits with certain financial institutions which exceed federally insured limits. We have reviewed the creditworthiness of these financial institutions and believe that there is minimal risk of a material loss. 
    
  Certain European countries have experienced varying degrees of financial stress. Risks from the debt crisis in Europe could continue to disrupt the financial markets, which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and on sovereign and non-sovereign obligations. There remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments in the European debt crisis and the impact on financial markets. 
    
  The chart shown below includes our non-sovereign fair value exposures in these countries as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we had no unfunded exposure and had no direct sovereign fair value exposure.

Realized Gains and Losses 
    
  The following table sets forth realized investment gains and losses for the periods shown: 

(1) These derivatives include the interest support agreement, two early renewable term ("YRT") premium support agreements, and three portfolio maintenance agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and PLC. 
    
  Realized gains and losses on investments reflect portfolio management activities designed to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities and to enhance long-term investment portfolio performance. The change in net realized investment gains (losses), excluding impairments and Modco trading portfolio activity during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), primarily reflects the normal operation of our asset/liability program within the context of the changing interest rate and spread environment, as well as tax planning strategies designed to utilize capital loss carryforwards. 
    
  Realized losses are comprised of both write-downs of other-than-temporary impairments and actual sales of investments. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) we concluded that approximately $3.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, of investment securities in an unrealized loss position were other-than-temporarily impaired, due to credit related factors, resulting in a charge to earnings. Additionally, $1.4 million of non-credit gains and $3.3 million of non-credit losses was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), respectively.  

Table of Contents  

For the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company), we recognized pre-tax other-than-temporary impairments of $0.5 million due to credit-related factors, resulting in a charge to earnings. Of the credit losses, $0.1 million were non-credit losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income.  
    
  These other-than-temporary impairments resulted from our analysis of circumstances and our belief that credit events, loss severity, changes in credit enhancement, and/or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to these investments. These other-than-temporary impairments, net of Modco recoveries, are presented in the chart below:  

As previously discussed, management considers several factors when determining other-than-temporary impairments. Although we purchase securities with the intent to hold them until maturity, we may change our position as a result of a change in circumstances. Any such decision is consistent with our classification of all but a specific portion of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we sold securities in an unrealized loss position with a fair value of $67.7 million. For such securities, the proceeds, realized loss, and total time period that the security had been in an unrealized loss position are presented in the table below for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company): 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) we sold securities in an unrealized loss position with a fair value (proceeds) of $7.1 million and $67.7 million, respectively. The losses realized on the sale of these securities were $1.6 million and $6.9 million, respectively. We made the decision to exit these holdings in conjunction with our overall asset liability management process. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we sold securities in an unrealized gain position with a fair value of $167.3 million and $987.0 million, respectively. The gains realized on the sale of these securities were $3.2 million and $31.0 million, respectively. 
    
  The $1.5 million of other realized losses recognized for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), consisted of a decrease in mortgage loan reserves of $0.4 million and mortgage loan losses of $1.9 million.  
    
  The $7.8 million of other realized losses recognized for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), consisted realized losses related to mortgage loans of $1.6 million, an increase in mortgage loan reserves of $3.5 million, partnership losses of $2.5 million, and real estate realized losses of $0.2 million. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) net gains of $24.0 million and $178.4 million, respectively, primarily related to changes in fair value on our Modco trading portfolios were included in realized gains and losses. Of the $178.4 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), approximately $2.0 million of losses were realized through the sale of certain securities, which will be reimbursed to our reinsurance partners over time through the reinsurance settlement process for this block of business. 
    
  The Modco embedded derivative associated with the trading portfolios had realized pre-tax losses of $24.2 million and $105.4 million, respectively, during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). The losses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) were due to lower treasury yields.

Realized investment gains and losses related to derivatives represent changes in their fair value during the period and termination gains/(losses) on those derivatives that were closed during the period. 
    
  We use various derivative instruments to manage risks related to certain life insurance and annuity products. We can use these derivatives as economic hedges against risks inherent in the products. These risks have a direct impact on the cost of these products and are correlated with the equity markets, interest rates, foreign currency levels, and overall volatility. The hedged risks are recorded through the recognition of embedded derivatives associated with the products. These products include the GMWB rider associated with the variable annuity, fixed indexed annuity products as well as indexed universal life products. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) we experienced net realized gains on derivatives related to VA contracts of approximately $8.1 million and $152.2 million, respectively. These net gains on derivatives related to VA contracts were affected by capital market impacts. 
    
  The Funds Withheld derivative associated with Shades Creek had pre-tax realized gains of $53.8 million and $63.9 million, respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  Certain of our subsidiaries have derivatives with PLC. These derivatives consist of an interest support agreement, two YRT premium support agreements, and three portfolio maintenance agreements with PLC. We recognized gains of $14.8 million and $28.6 million, respectively related to the interest support agreement for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). We recognized losses of $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the YRT premium support agreements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). We entered into two separate portfolio maintenance agreements in October 2012 and one portfolio maintenance agreement in January 2016. We recognized pre-tax losses of $0.8 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and pre-tax gains of $3.6 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 
    
  We also use various swaps and other types of derivatives to mitigate risk related to other exposures. These contracts generated gains of $0.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and losses of $0.1 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). 

Unrealized Gains and Losses   Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  The information presented below relates to investments at a certain point in time and is not necessarily indicative of the status of the portfolio at any time after   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the balance sheet date. Information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to rapidly changing conditions, including volatility of financial markets and changes in interest rates. Management considers a number of factors in determining if an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, including the expected cash to be collected and the intent, likelihood, and/or ability to hold the security until recovery. Consistent with our long-standing practice, we do not utilize a  bright line test  to determine other-than-temporary impairments. On a quarterly basis, we perform an analysis on every security with an unrealized loss to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. This analysis includes reviewing several metrics including collateral, expected cash flows, ratings, and liquidity. Furthermore, since the timing of recognizing realized gains and losses is largely based on management s decisions as to the timing and selection of investments to be sold, the tables and information provided below should be considered within the context of the overall unrealized gain/(loss) position of the portfolio. We had an overall net unrealized loss of $138.6 million, prior to tax and the related impact of certain insurance assets and liabilities offsets, as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), and an overall net unrealized loss of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 (Successor Company). 
    
  For fixed maturity and equity securities held that are in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the fair value, amortized cost, unrealized loss, and total time period that the security has been in an unrealized loss position are presented in the table below:  

The book value of our investment portfolio was marked to fair value as of February 1, 2015 (Successor Company), in conjunction with the Dai-ichi Merger which resulted in the elimination of previously unrealized gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income. The level of interest rates as of February 1, 2015 (Successor Company), resulted in an increase in  

Table of Contents  

the carrying value of our investments. Since February 1, 2015 (Successor Company) interest rates have increased resulting in net unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the Barclays Investment Grade Index was priced at 133.0 bps versus a 10 year average of 176.1 bps. Similarly, the Barclays High Yield Index was priced at 508.7 bps versus a 10 year average of 647.0 bps. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), the five, ten, and thirty-year U.S. Treasury obligations were trading at levels of 1.150%, 1.595%, and 2.316%, as compared to 10 year averages of 2.003%, 2.875%, and 3.696%, respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), 83.8% of the unrealized loss was associated with securities that were rated investment grade. We have examined the performance of the underlying collateral and cash flows and expect that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms. Factors such as credit enhancements within the deal structures and the underlying collateral performance/characteristics support the recoverability of the investments. Based on the factors discussed, we do not consider these unrealized loss positions to be other-than-temporary. However, from time to time, we may sell securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio to meet diversification, credit quality, yield enhancement, asset/liability management, and liquidity requirements. 
    
  Expectations that investments in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on assumptions that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value. It is reasonably possible that the underlying collateral of these investments will perform worse than current market expectations and that such an event may lead to adverse changes in the cash flows on our holdings of these types of securities. This could lead to potential future write-downs within our portfolio of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Expectations that our investments in corporate securities and/or debt obligations will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on evidence gathered through our normal credit surveillance process. Although we do not anticipate such events, it is reasonably possible that issuers of our investments in corporate securities will perform worse than current expectations. Such events may lead us to recognize potential future write-downs within our portfolio of corporate securities. It is also possible that such unanticipated events would lead us to dispose of those certain holdings and recognize the effects of any such market movements in our financial statements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), there were estimated gross unrealized losses of $3.5 million related to our mortgage-backed securities collateralized by Alt-A mortgage loans. Gross unrealized losses in our securities collateralized by Alt-A residential mortgage loans as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), were primarily the result of continued widening spreads, representing marketplace uncertainty arising from higher defaults in Alt-A residential mortgage loans and rating agency downgrades of securities collateralized by Alt-A residential mortgage loans.

The range of maturity dates for securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) varies, with 10.2% maturing in less than 5 years, 10.4% maturing between 5 and 10 years, and 79.4% maturing after 10 years. The following table shows the credit rating of securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company): 

As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we held a total of 1,230 positions that were in an unrealized loss position. Included in that amount were 144 positions of below investment grade securities with a fair value of $1.2 billion that were in an unrealized loss position. Total unrealized losses related to below investment grade securities were $127.4 million, $112.4 million  

Table of Contents  

of which had been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months. Below investment grade securities in an unrealized loss position were 2.2% of invested assets. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), securities in an unrealized loss position that were rated as below investment grade represented 7.2% of the total fair value and 16.2% of the total unrealized loss. We have the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity. After a review of each security and its expected cash flows, we believe the decline in market value to be temporary. 
    
  The following table includes the fair value, amortized cost, unrealized loss, and total time period that the security has been in an unrealized loss position for all below investment grade securities as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company): 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. We meet our liquidity requirements primarily through positive cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. Primary sources of cash from the operating subsidiaries are premiums, deposits for policyholder accounts, investment sales and maturities, and investment income. Primary uses of cash include benefit payments, withdrawals from policyholder accounts, investment purchases, policy acquisition costs, interest payments, and other operating expenses. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our cash needs under normal operating scenarios. 
    
  In the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond our normal liquidity needs, we have additional sources of liquidity available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These additional sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, the sale of liquid assets, accessing our credit facility, and other sources described herein. 
    
  Our decision to sell investment assets could be impacted by accounting rules, including rules relating to the likelihood of a requirement to sell securities before recovery of our cost basis. Under stressful market and economic conditions, liquidity may broadly deteriorate, which could negatively impact our ability to sell investment assets. If we require on short notice significant amounts of cash in excess of normal requirements, we may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. 
    
  While we anticipate that the cash flows of our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet our investment commitments and operating cash needs in a normal credit market environment, we recognize that investment commitments scheduled to be funded may, from time to time, exceed the funds then available. Therefore, we have established repurchase agreement programs for certain of our insurance subsidiaries to provide liquidity when needed. We expect that the rate received on its investments will equal or exceed its borrowing rate. Under this program, we may, from time to time, sell an investment security at a specific price and agree to repurchase that security at another specified price at a later date. These borrowings are typically for a term less than 90 days. The market value of securities to be repurchased is monitored and collateral levels are adjusted where appropriate to protect the counterparty against credit exposure. Cash received is invested in fixed maturity securities, and the agreements provided for net settlement in the event of default or on termination of the agreements. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), the fair value of securities pledged under the repurchase program was $224.8 million and the repurchase obligation of $219.5 million was included in our consolidated condensed balance sheets (at an average borrowing rate of 43 basis points). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), the maximum balance outstanding at any one point in time related to these programs was $725.0 million. The average daily balance was $453.0 million (at an average borrowing rate of 41 basis points) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company). As of December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), the fair value of securities pledged under the repurchase program was $479.9 million and the repurchase obligation of $438.2 million was included in our consolidated condensed balance sheets. During 2015, the maximum balance outstanding at any one point in time related to these programs was $912.7 million. The average daily balance was $540.3 million and $77.4 million (at  

Table of Contents  

an average borrowing rate of 20 and 16 basis points) during the period of February 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 (Successor Company) and the period of January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015 (Predecessor Company). 
    
  Additionally, we may, from time to time, sell short-duration stable value products to complement our cash management practices. Depending on market conditions, we may also use securitization transactions involving our commercial mortgage loans to increase liquidity for the operating subsidiaries. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  On February 2, 2015, we and PLC amended and restated the Credit Facility (the  Credit Facility ). Under the Credit Facility, we have the ability to borrow on an unsecured basis up to an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. We have the right in certain circumstances to request that the commitment under the Credit Facility be increased up to a maximum principal amount of $1.25 billion. Balances outstanding under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Borrowers, (i) LIBOR plus a spread based on the ratings of PLC s Senior Debt, or (ii) the sum of (A) a rate equal to the highest of (x) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (y) 0.50% above the Federal Funds rate, or (z) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% and (B) a spread based on the ratings of PLC's Senior Debt. The Credit Facility also provided for a facility fee at a rate that varies with the ratings of PLC s Senior Debt and that is calculated on the aggregate amount of commitments under the Credit Facility, whether used or unused. The initial facility fee rate was 0.15% on February 2, 2015, and was adjusted to 0.125% upon PLC s subsequent ratings upgrade on February 2, 2015. The Credit Facility provides that PLC is liable for the full amount of any obligations for borrowings or letters of credit, including those of the Company, under the Credit Facility. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is February 2, 2020. We are not aware of any non-compliance with the financial debt covenants of the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). PLC had an outstanding balance of $385.0 million bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.00% as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). As of June 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we had used $30.0 million of borrowing capacity by executing a Letter of Credit under the Credit Facility for the benefit on an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary of the Company. This Letter of Credit was terminated during the period and no Letter of Credit was outstanding as of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company). 
    
  Sources and Use of Cash 
    
  Our primary sources of funding are from our insurance operations and revenues from investments. These sources of cash support our operations and are used to pay dividends to PLC. The states in which we and our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on the ability to pay dividends. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year s statutory income and/or surplus. 
    
  We are a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati and FHLB of New York. FHLB advances provide an attractive funding source for short-term borrowing and for the sale of funding agreements. Membership in the FHLB requires that we purchase FHLB capital stock based on a minimum requirement and a percentage of the dollar amount of advances outstanding. Our borrowing capacity is determined by criteria established by each respective bank. 
    
  We held $65.7 million of FHLB common stock as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), which is included in equity securities. In addition, our obligations under the advances must be collateralized. We maintain control over any such pledged assets, including the right of substitution. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we had $822.3 million of funding agreement-related advances and accrued interest outstanding under the FHLB program. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we reported approximately $544.2 million (fair value) of Auction Rate Securities ( ARS ) in non-Modco portfolios. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), 100% of these ARS were rated Aaa/AA+. While the auction rate market has experienced liquidity constraints, we believe that based on our current liquidity position and our operating cash flows, any lack of liquidity in the ARS market will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition, or cash flows. For information on how we determine the fair value of these securities refer to Note 7,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  , of the consolidated condensed financial statements. 
    
  The liquidity requirements of our regulated insurance subsidiaries primarily relate to the liabilities associated with their various insurance and investment products, operating expenses, and income taxes. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment products include the payment of policyholder benefits, as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders and withdrawals, policy loans, and obligations to redeem funding agreements. 
    
  Our insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits and expected surrenders, withdrawals, loans, and redemption obligations without forced sales of investments. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries hold highly liquid, high-quality short-term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities to fund our expected operating expenses, surrenders, and withdrawals. We were committed as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), to fund mortgage loans in the amount of $726.2 million. 
    
  Our positive cash flows from operations are used to fund an investment portfolio that provides for future benefit payments. We employ a formal asset/liability program to manage the cash flows of our investment portfolio relative to our long-term benefit obligations. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we held cash and short-term investments of approximately $576.1 million. 

Table of Contents  

The following chart includes the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the following periods: 

For The   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company)  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities   - Cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums received, fees received, investment income, and expenses paid. Principal sources of cash include sales of our products and services. We typically generate positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums and policy fees collected from our insurance and investment products exceed benefit payments and redemptions, and we invest the excess. Accordingly, in analyzing our cash flows we focus on the amount of cash provided by or used in investing and financing activities. 
    
  Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities   - Changes in cash from investing activities primarily related to the activity in our investment portfolio and the purchase of $2.2 billion of held-to-maturity securities issued by affiliates in conjunction with the GLAIC reinsurance transaction. See Note 3,   Reinsurance and Financing Transactions   and Note 12,   Debt and Other Obligations   for additional information on the transaction. 
    
  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities   - Changes in cash from financing activities included $218.7 million of outflows from repurchase program borrowings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company) and $1.8 billion of inflows of investment product and universal life net activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). Net issuance of non-recourse funding obligations was $2.2 billion during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), which occurred in conjunction with the GLAIC reinsurance transaction. See Note 3,   Reinsurance and Financing Transactions   and Note 12,   Debt and Other Obligations   for additional information on the transaction. 

Capital Resources 
    
  Our primary sources of capital are from retained income from our insurance operations and capital infusions from our parent, PLC. Additionally, we have access to the Credit Facility discussed above. 
    
  Captive Reinsurance Companies 
    
  Our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled  Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,  commonly known as  Regulation XXX,  and a supporting guideline entitled  The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,  commonly known as  Guideline AXXX.  The regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that these levels of reserves are non-economic. We use captive reinsurance companies to implement reinsurance and capital management actions to satisfy these reserve requirements by financing the non-economic reserves either through the issuance of non-recourse funding obligations by the captives or obtaining Letters of Credit from third-party financial institutions. For more information regarding our use of captives and their impact on our financial statements, please refer to Note 12,   Debt and Other Obligations  . 
    
  Our captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. Our captives are capitalized to a level we believe is sufficient to support the contractual risks and other general obligations of the respective captive entity. All of our captive reinsurance companies are wholly owned subsidiaries and are located domestically. The captive insurance companies are subject to regulations in the state of domicile. 
    
    The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ), through various committees, subgroups and dedicated task forces, is reviewing the use of captives and special purpose vehicles used to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations, and several committees have adopted or exposed for comment white papers and reports that, if or when implemented, could impose additional requirements on the use of captives and other reinsurers. The Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC recently established a Variable Annuity Issues Working Group to examine company use of variable annuity captives. The Committee has proposed changes in the regulation of variable annuities and variable annuity captives could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. 
    
    The Principles Based Reserving Implementation (EX) Task Force of the NAIC, charged with analysis of the adoption of a principles-based reserving methodology, adopted the  conceptual framework  contained in a report issued by Rector   Associates, Inc., dated June 4, 2014 (as modified or supplemented, the  Rector Report ), that contains numerous recommendations  

Table of Contents  

pertaining to the regulation and use of certain captive reinsurers. Certain high-level recommendations have been adopted and assigned to various NAIC working groups, which working groups are in various stages of discussions regarding recommendations. One recommendation of the Rector Report was adopted as Actuarial Guideline XLVIII ( AG48 ). AG48 sets more restrictive standards on the permitted collateral utilized to back reserves of a captive. In September 2016, the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC adopted the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation (the "Reserve Model") which is substantially similar to AG48. AG48 and the Reserve Model will likely make it difficult for the Company to establish new captive financing arrangements on a basis consistent with past practices. As a result of AG48 and the Reserve Model, the implementation of new captive structures in the future may be less capital efficient, may lead to lower product returns and/or increased product pricing or result in reduced sales of certain products. In some circumstances, AG48 and the Reserve Model could impact the Company s ability to engage in certain reinsurance transactions with non-affiliates  . 
    
  We also use a captive reinsurance company to reinsure risks associated with GMWB and GMDB riders which helps us to manage those risks on an economic basis. In an effort to mitigate the equity market risks relative to our RBC ratio, in the fourth quarter of 2012, PLC established a direct wholly owned subsidiary, Shades Creek Captive Insurance Company ( Shades Creek ), to which we have reinsured GMWB and GMDB riders related to its VA contracts. The purpose of Shades Creek is to reduce the volatility in RBC due to non-economic variables included within the RBC calculation. 
    
  During 2012, PLC entered into an intercompany capital support agreement with Shades Creek. The agreement provides through a guarantee that PLC will contribute assets or purchase surplus notes (or cause an affiliate or third party to contribute assets or purchase surplus notes) in amounts necessary for Shades Creek s regulatory capital levels to equal or exceed minimum thresholds as defined by the agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), Shades Creek maintained capital levels in excess of the required minimum thresholds. The maximum potential future payment amount which could be required under the capital support agreement will be dependent on numerous factors, including the performance of equity markets, the level of interest rates, performance of associated hedges, and related policyholder behavior. 
    
     Statutory Capital 
    
  A life insurance company s statutory capital is computed according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by state law. Generally speaking, other states in which a company does business defer to the interpretation of the domiciliary state with respect to NAIC rules, unless inconsistent with the other state s regulations. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to reflect a more conservative view, for example, requiring immediate expensing of policy acquisition costs. The NAIC s risk-based capital requirements require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based capital formula. The achievement of long-term growth will require growth in the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as retained statutory earnings or our equity contributions. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid thirty days after written notice to the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile unless such commissioner objects to the dividend prior to the expiration of such period. Dividends in larger amounts are considered extraordinary and are subject to affirmative prior approval by such commissioner. The maximum amount that would qualify as an ordinary dividend from our insurance subsidiaries in 2016 is approximately $165.6 million. 
    
  State insurance regulators and the NAIC have adopted risk-based capital ( RBC ) requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. A company s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense, and reserve items. Regulators can then measure the adequacy of a company s statutory surplus by comparing it to RBC. We manage our capital consumption by using the ratio of our total adjusted capital, as defined by the insurance regulators, to our company action level RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by insurance regulators. 
    
  Statutory reserves established for VA contracts are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees and product design. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance may be non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the capital required due to their impact on the valuation of reserves and derivative investments mitigating the risk in these reserves. Risk mitigation activities may result in material and sometimes counterintuitive impacts on statutory surplus and RBC ratio. Notably, as changes in these market and non-market factors occur, both our potential obligation and the related statutory reserves and/or required capital can vary at a non-linear rate. 
    
  Our statutory surplus is impacted by credit spreads as a result of accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed MVA annuities. Statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed MVA annuities are recorded at fair value. In determining the statutory reserve for the fixed MVA annuities, we are required to use current crediting rates based on U.S. Treasuries. In many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates based on U.S. Treasuries are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. As a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. However, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase or decrease sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value gains or losses. As actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates based on U.S. Treasuries, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in a change in statutory surplus. 
    
  On January 15, 2016, we closed the reinsurance transaction with GLAIC. We currently estimate that the total capital investment was approximately $589 million, instead of $661 million, as previously estimated and disclosed. The estimated total  

Table of Contents  

capital investment decreased primarily due to lower initial risk-based capital than previously estimated and our ability to utilize certain tax benefits sooner than expected. 
    
  We cede material amounts of insurance and transfer related assets to other insurance companies through reinsurance. However, notwithstanding the transfer of related assets, we remain liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations that it assumed. We evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor the associated concentration of credit risk. For   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we ceded premiums to third party reinsurers amounting to $325.4 million and $980.8 million. In addition, we had receivables from reinsurers amounting to $5.2 billion as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company). We review reinsurance receivable amounts for collectability and establish bad debt reserves if deemed appropriate. 
    
  Ratings 
    
  Various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ( rating organizations ) review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in an insurer s products, its ability to market its products and its competitive position. The following table summarizes the current financial strength ratings of our significant member companies from the major independent rating organizations:

Our ratings are subject to review and change by the rating organizations at any time and without notice. A downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales, relationships with distributors, the level of policy surrenders and withdrawals, competitive position in the marketplace, and the cost or availability of reinsurance. The rating agencies may take various actions, positive or negative, with respect to the debt and financial strength ratings of PLC and its subsidiaries, including as a result of PLC s status as a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life. 

LIABILITIES 
    
  Many of our products contain surrender charges and other features that are designed to reward persistency and penalize the early withdrawal of funds. Certain stable value and annuity contracts have market-value adjustments that protect us against investment losses if interest rates are higher at the time of surrender than at the time of issue. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), we had policy liabilities and accruals of approximately $31.4 billion. Our interest-sensitive life insurance policies have a weighted average minimum credited interest rate of approximately 3.49%. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  We enter into various obligations to third parties in the ordinary course of our operations. However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be assessed solely based upon an analysis of these obligations. The most significant factors affecting our future cash flows are our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers, and the cash flows arising from our investment program. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, will also vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. Examples of fixed obligations include our obligations to pay principal and interest on fixed-rate borrowings. Examples of obligations that will vary include obligations to pay interest on variable-rate borrowings and insurance liabilities that depend on future interest rates, market performance, or surrender provisions. Many of our obligations are linked to cash-generating contracts. In addition, our operations involve significant expenditures that are not based upon contractual obligations. These include expenditures for income taxes and payroll. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we carried a $9.8 million liability for uncertain tax positions. These amounts are not included in the long-term contractual obligations table because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the occurrence or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. 

Table of Contents  

The table below sets forth future maturities of our contractual obligations: 

(1) 
    Non-recourse funding obligations include all undiscounted principal amounts owed and expected future interest payments due over the term of the notes. Of the total undiscounted cash flows, $1.8 billion relates to the Golden Gate V transaction. These cash outflows are matched and predominantly offset by the cash inflows Golden Gate V receives from notes issued by a nonconsolidated variable interest entity. Additionally, $3.0 billion relates to the Golden Gate transaction that occurred in Q1 2016. These cash outflows are matched and predominantly offset by the cash inflows Golden Gate receives from notes issued by nonconsolidated entity and third parties. The remaining amounts are associated with the Golden Gate II notes held by third parties as well as certain obligations assumed with the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company. 
              (2) 
    Anticipated stable value products cash flows including interest.

    The lease payments shown assume we exercise our option to purchase the building at the end of the lease term. Additionally, the payments due by the periods above were computed based on the terms of the renegotiated lease agreement, which was entered in December 2013. 
              (5) 
    Represents secured borrowings as part of our repurchase program as well as related interest. 
              (6) 
    Estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions comparable to our historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. These obligations are based on current balance sheet values and include expected interest crediting, but do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, or future deposits. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. As variable separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations, the variable separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from variable separate account assets. We expect to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  FASB guidance defines fair value for GAAP and establishes a framework for measuring fair value as well as a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The term  fair value  in this document is defined in accordance with GAAP. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. For more information, see Note 7,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We have entered into operating leases that do not result in an obligation being recorded on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 13,   Commitments and Contingencies  , of the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 
    
  Our financial position and earnings are subject to various market risks including changes in interest rates, the yield curve, spreads between risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, foreign currency rates, used vehicle prices, and equity price risks and issuer defaults. We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, through an integrated asset/liability management process. Our asset/liability management programs and procedures involve the monitoring of asset and liability durations for various product lines; cash flow testing under various interest rate scenarios; and the continuous rebalancing of assets and liabilities with respect to yield, credit and market risk, and cash flow characteristics. These programs also incorporate the use of derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency exchange risk, volatility risk, and equity market risk. See Note 8,   Derivative Financial Instruments   to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in this report for additional information on our financial instruments. 
    
  The primary focus of our asset/liability program is the management of interest rate risk within the insurance operations. This includes monitoring the duration of both investments and insurance liabilities to maintain an appropriate balance between risk and profitability for each product category, and for us as a whole. It is our policy to maintain asset and liability durations within one year of one another, although, from time to time, a broader interval may be allowed. 

Table of Contents  

We are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio and through derivative counterparties. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor s continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument or contract. We manage credit risk through established investment policies which attempt to address quality of obligors and counterparties, credit concentration limits, diversification requirements, and acceptable risk levels under expected and stressed scenarios. Derivative counterparty credit risk is measured as the amount owed to us, net of collateral held, based upon current market conditions. In addition, we periodically assess exposure related to potential payment obligations between us and our counterparties. We minimize the credit risk in derivative financial instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties, (A-rated or higher at the time we enter into the contract), and we maintain credit support annexes with certain of those counterparties. 
    
  We utilize a risk management strategy that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative instruments expose us to credit market and basis risk. Such instruments can change materially in value from period- to-period. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties. We manage the market and basis risks by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may be undertaken. We monitor our use of derivatives in connection with our overall asset/liability management programs and procedures. In addition, all derivative programs are monitored by our risk management department. 
    
  Derivative instruments that are used as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps, and interest rate options. Our inflation risk management strategy involves the use of swaps that require us to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate that is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ). 
    
  We may use the following types of derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to certain guaranteed benefits related to variable annuity, fixed indexed annuity, and indexed universal life contracts: 
    
     Foreign Currency Futures 
     Variance Swaps 
     Interest Rate Futures 
     Equity Options 
     Equity Futures 
     Credit Derivatives 
     Interest Rate Swaps 
     Interest Rate Swaptions 
     Volatility Futures 
     Volatility Options 
     Funds Withheld Agreement 
     Total Return Swaps 
    
  Other Derivatives 
    
  Certain of our subsidiaries have derivatives with PLC. These derivatives consist of an interest support agreement, YRT premium support arrangements, and portfolio maintenance agreements with PLC. 
    
  We have a funds withheld account that consists of various derivative instruments held by us that is used to hedge the GMWB and GMDB riders. The economic performance of derivatives in the funds withheld account is ceded to Shades Creek. The funds withheld account is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument. 
    
  We believe that our asset/liability management programs and procedures and certain product features provide protection against the effects of changes in interest rates under various scenarios. Additionally, we believe our asset/liability management programs and procedures provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to fulfill our obligation to pay benefits under our various insurance and deposit contracts. However, our asset/liability management programs and procedures incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve), relationships between risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity, spread movements, implied volatility, policyholder behavior, and other factors, and the effectiveness of our asset/liability management programs and procedures may be negatively affected whenever actual results differ from those assumptions. 
    
  In the ordinary course of our commercial mortgage lending operations, we may commit to provide a mortgage loan before the property to be mortgaged has been built or acquired. The mortgage loan commitment is a contractual obligation to fund a mortgage loan when called upon by the borrower. The commitment is not recognized in our financial statements until the commitment is actually funded. The mortgage loan commitment contains terms, including the rate of interest, which may be different than prevailing interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016   (Successor Company), we had outstanding mortgage loan commitments of $726.2 million at an average rate of 4.2%. 
    
  Impact of continued low interest rate environment 
    
  Significant changes in interest rates expose us to the risk of not realizing anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the interest rate credited to in-force policies and contracts. In addition, certain of our insurance and investment products guarantee a minimum guaranteed interest rate ( MGIR ). In periods of prolonged low interest rates, the interest spread earned may be negatively impacted to the extent our ability to reduce policyholder crediting rates is limited by the guaranteed minimum credited interest rates. Additionally, those policies without account values may exhibit lower profitability in periods of prolonged low interest rates due to reduced investment income.

We are active in mitigating the impact of a continued low interest rate environment through product design, as well as adjusting crediting rates on current in-force policies and contracts. We also manage interest rate and reinvestment risks through our asset/liability management process. Our asset/liability management programs and procedures involve the monitoring of asset and liability durations; cash flow testing under various interest rate scenarios; and the regular rebalancing of assets and liabilities with respect to yield, credit and market risk, and cash flow characteristics. These programs also incorporate the use of derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency exchange risk, volatility risk, and equity market risk. 

IMPACT OF INFLATION 
    
  Inflation increases the need for life insurance. Many policyholders who once had adequate insurance programs may increase their life insurance coverage to provide the same relative financial benefit and protection. Higher interest rates may result in higher sales of certain of our investment products. 
    
  The higher interest rates that have traditionally accompanied inflation could also affect our operations. Policy loans increase as policy loan interest rates become relatively more attractive. As interest rates increase, disintermediation of stable value and annuity account balances and individual life policy cash values may increase. The market value of our fixed-rate, long-term investments may decrease, we may be unable to implement fully the interest rate reset and call provisions of our mortgage loans, and our ability to make attractive mortgage loans, including participating mortgage loans, may decrease. In addition, participating mortgage loan income may decrease. The difference between the interest rate earned on investments and the interest rate credited to life insurance and investment products may also be adversely affected by rising interest rates. During the periods covered by this report, we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our business.

  (a)                                       Disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  In order to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain judgments, including the costs and benefits of controls and the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
    
  As described in Note 3 to the consolidated condensed financial statements set forth in this periodic report on Form 10-Q, the Company entered into a reinsurance transaction with Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company effective January 1, 2016. The Company performed due diligence on this transaction prior to the effective date and developed a reasonable level of assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures for the related administrative systems and processes were effective.  
    
  (b)                                   Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor Company), that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal controls exist within a dynamic environment and the Company continually strives to improve its internal controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting. 

PART II 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  The operating results of companies in the insurance industry have historically been subject to significant fluctuations. The factors which could affect the Company s future results include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and known trends and uncertainties. In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A,   Risk Factors,   in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (Successor Company), which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, or future results of operations. 
    
  The Company is exposed to risks related to natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes, diseases, epidemics, pandemics, malicious acts, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts and climate change, which could adversely affect the Company s operations and results. 
    
  While the Company has obtained insurance, implemented risk management and contingency plans, and taken preventive measures and other precautions, no predictions of specific scenarios can be made nor can assurance be given that there are not scenarios that could have an adverse effect on the Company. A natural or man-made disaster or catastrophe, including a severe weather or geological event such as a storm, tornado, fire, flood, or earthquake, disease, epidemic, pandemic, malicious act,     cyber-attack,  terrorist act, or the occurrence of climate change, could cause the Company s workforce to be unable to engage in operations at one or more of its facilities or result in short- or long-term interruptions in the Company s business operations, any of which could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period. In addition, certain of these events could adversely affect the mortality, morbidity, or other experience of the Company or its reinsurers and have a significant negative impact on the Company. In addition, claims arising from the occurrence of such events or conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Such events or conditions could also have an adverse effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies. The Company s risk management efforts and other precautionary plans and activities may not adequately predict the impact on the Company from such events. 
    
  In addition, such events or conditions could result in a decrease or halt in economic activity in large geographic areas, adversely affecting the marketing or administration of the Company s business within such geographic areas and/or the general economic climate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Company. Such events or conditions could also result in additional regulation or restrictions on the Company in the conduct of its business. The possible macroeconomic effects of such events or conditions could also adversely affect the Company s asset portfolio, as well as many other aspects of the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  Confidential information maintained in the systems of the Company or other parties upon which the Company relies could be compromised or misappropriated, damaging the Company s business and reputation and adversely affecting its financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  In the course of conducting its business, the Company retains confidential information, including information about its customers and proprietary business information. The Company retains confidential information in various electronic systems, including computer systems, data processing and administrative systems, and communication systems. The Company maintains  

Table of Contents  

physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to protect the information and it relies on commercial technologies to maintain the security of its systems and to maintain the security of its transmission of such information to other parties, including its business partners, counterparties and service providers. The Company s business partners, counter parties and service providers likewise maintain confidential information, including, in some cases, customer information, on behalf of the Company. An intentional or unintentional breach or compromise of the security measures of the Company or such other parties could result in the disclosure, misappropriation, misuse, alteration or destruction of the confidential information retained by or on behalf of the Company, or the inability of the Company to conduct business for an indeterminate amount of time. Any of these events or circumstances could damage the Company s business and reputation, and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, causing harm to the Company s business operations and customers, deterring customers and others from doing business with the Company, subjecting the Company to significant regulatory, civil, and criminal liability, and requiring the Company to incur significant legal and other expenses. 
        
                  Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate and implement effective preventative measures against security breaches of all types because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources or parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our system to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. 
    
  Cyber threats and related legal and regulatory standards applicable to our business are rapidly evolving and may subject the Company to heightened legal standards, new theories of liability and material claims and penalties that we cannot currently predict or anticipate.  As cyber threats and applicable legal standards continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and to pay claims, fines or penalties. While the Company has experienced cyber-attacks in the past, and to date the Company has not suffered any material harm or loss relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches at the Company or its counterparties, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. 
    
  The Company s results and financial condition may be negatively affected should actual experience differ from management s assumptions and estimates. 
    
    In the conduct of business, the Company makes certain assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses, interest rates, equity market volatility, tax liability, business mix, frequency and severity of claims, contingent liabilities, investment performance, and other factors appropriate to the type of business it expects to experience in future periods. These assumptions are also used to estimate the amounts of deferred policy acquisition costs, policy liabilities and accruals, future earnings, and various components of the Company s balance sheet. These assumptions are used in the operation of the Company s business in making decisions crucial to the success of the Company, including the pricing of products and expense structures relating to products. The Company s actual experience, as well as changes in estimates, is used to prepare the Company s financial statements. To the extent the Company s actual experience and changes in estimates differ from original estimates, the Company s financial condition may be affected.      
    
  Mortality, morbidity, and casualty expectations incorporate assumptions about many factors, including for example, how a product is distributed, for what purpose the product is purchased, the mix of customers purchasing the products, persistency and lapses, future progress in the fields of health and medicine, and the projected level of used vehicle values. Actual mortality, morbidity, and/or casualty experience may differ from expectations. In addition, continued activity in the viatical, stranger-owned, and/or life settlement industry could cause the Company s level of lapses to differ from its assumptions about persistency and lapses, which could negatively impact the Company s performance. 
    
  The calculations the Company uses to estimate various components of its balance sheet and statements of income are necessarily complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data. The Company currently employs various techniques for such calculations and relies, in certain instances, on third parties to make or assist in making such calculations. From time to time it develops and implements more sophisticated administrative systems and procedures capable of facilitating the calculation of more precise estimates. The systems and procedures that the Company develops and the Company's reliance upon third parties could result in errors in the calculations that impact our financial statements or affect our financial condition. 
    
  Assumptions and estimates involve judgment, and by their nature are imprecise and subject to changes and revisions over time. Accordingly, the Company s results may be affected, positively or negatively, from time to time, by actual results differing from assumptions, by changes in estimates, and by changes resulting from implementing more sophisticated administrative systems and procedures that facilitate the calculation of more precise estimates. 
    
  The Company may not realize its anticipated financial results from its acquisitions strategy. 
    
  The Company s acquisitions of companies and coinsurance of blocks of insurance business have increased its earnings. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will have future suitable opportunities for, or sufficient capital available to fund, such transactions. If our competitors have access to capital on more favorable terms or at a lower cost, our ability to compete for acquisitions may be diminished. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to realize any projected operating efficiencies or realize the anticipated financial results from such transactions. 
    
  The Company may be unable to complete an acquisition transaction. Completion of an acquisition transaction may be more costly or take longer than expected, or may have a different or more costly financing structure than initially contemplated. In addition, the Company may not be able to complete or manage multiple acquisition transactions at the same time, or the completion of such transactions may be delayed or be more costly than initially contemplated. The Company or other parties to  

Table of Contents  

the transaction may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required to complete an acquisition transaction. If the Company identifies and completes suitable acquisitions, it may not be able to successfully integrate the business in a timely or cost-effective manner, or retain key personnel and business relationships necessary to achieve anticipated financial results. In addition, there may be unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with businesses or blocks of insurance business that the Company acquires. Additionally, in connection with its acquisition transactions that involve reinsurance, the Company assumes, or otherwise becomes responsible for, the obligations of policies and other liabilities of other insurers. Any regulatory, legal, financial, or other adverse development affecting the other insurer could also have an adverse effect on the Company. 
    
  The Company s use of derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy may not be effective or sufficient. 
    
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy to mitigate risks to which it is exposed, including the adverse effects of domestic and/or international credit and/or equity market and/or interest rate levels, foreign exchange risks, or volatility on its fixed indexed annuity and variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features. These derivative financial instruments may not effectively offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in the value of such guarantees and the changes in the value of the derivative financial instruments purchased by the Company, extreme credit and/or equity market and/or interest rate levels or volatility, contract holder behavior that differs from the Company s expectations, and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds of such variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features and the indices utilized by the Company in estimating its exposure to such guarantees. 
    
  The Company may also use derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy to mitigate risks arising from its exposure to investments in individual issuers or sectors of issuers and to mitigate the adverse effects of distressed domestic and/or international credit and/or equity markets and/or interest rate levels or volatility on its overall financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  The use of derivative financial instruments by the Company may have an adverse impact on the level of statutory capital and the risk-based capital ratios of the Company s insurance subsidiaries. The Company employs strategies in the use of derivative financial instruments that are intended to mitigate such adverse impacts, but the Company s strategies may not be effective. 
    
  The Company may also choose not to hedge, in whole or in part, these or other risks that it has identified, due to, for example, the availability and/or cost of a suitable derivative financial instrument or, in reaction to extreme credit, equity market and/or interest rate levels or volatility. Additionally, the Company s estimates and assumptions made in connection with its use of any derivative financial instrument may fail to reflect or correspond to its actual long-term exposure in respect to identified risks. Derivative financial instruments held or purchased by the Company may also otherwise be insufficient to hedge the risks in relation to the Company s obligations. In addition, the Company may fail to identify risks, or the magnitude thereof, to which it is exposed. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its use of derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy may not be properly designed and/or may not be properly implemented as designed. 
    
  The Company is also subject to the risk that its derivative counterparties or clearinghouse may fail or refuse to meet their obligations to the Company under derivative financial instruments. If the Company s derivative counterparties or clearinghouse fail or refuse to meet their obligations to the Company in this regard, the Company s efforts to mitigate risks to which it is subject through the use of such derivative financial instruments may prove to be ineffective or inefficient. 
    
  The above factors, either alone or in combination, may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Disruption of the capital and credit markets could negatively affect the Company s ability to meet its liquidity and financing needs. 
    
  The Company needs liquidity to meet its obligations to its policyholders and its debt holders, and to pay its operating expenses. The Company s sources of liquidity include insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds, cash flow from investments and assets, and other income from its operations. In normal credit and capital market conditions, the Company s sources of liquidity also include a variety of short and long-term borrowing arrangements, including issuing debt securities. 
    
  The Company s business is dependent on the capital and credit markets, including confidence in such markets. When the credit and capital markets are disrupted and confidence is eroded the Company may not be able to borrow money, including through the issuance of debt securities, or the cost of borrowing or raising capital may be prohibitively high. If the Company s internal sources of liquidity are inadequate during such periods, the Company could suffer negative effects from not being able to borrow money, or from having to do so on unfavorable terms. The negative effects could include being forced to sell assets at a loss, a lowering of the Company s credit ratings and the financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries, and the possibility that customers, lenders, ratings agencies, or regulators develop a negative perception of the Company s financial prospects, which could lead to further adverse effects on the Company. 
    
  The Company could be adversely affected by an inability to access its credit facility. 
    
  The Company relies on its credit facility as a potential source of liquidity. The availability of these funds could be critical to the Company s credit and financial strength ratings and its ability to meet obligations, particularly when alternative sources of credit or liquidity are either difficult to access or costly. The availability of the Company s credit facility is dependent in part on the ability of the lenders to provide funds under the facility. The Company s credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net  

Table of Contents  

worth. The Company s right to make borrowings under the facility is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, including its compliance with all covenants. The Company s failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facility could restrict its ability to access this credit facility when needed. The Company s inability to access some or all of the line of credit under the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  The Company could be adversely affected by an inability to access FHLB lending. 
    
  The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (the  FHLB ) of Cincinnati and the FHLB of New York.  Membership provides the Company with access to FHLB financial services, including advances that provide an attractive funding source for short-term borrowing and for the sale of funding agreements. In recent years, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has released advisory bulletins addressing concerns associated with insurance company (as opposed to federally-backed bank) access to FHLB financial services, the state insurance regulatory framework and FHLB creditor status in the event of member insurer insolvency. In response to FHFA actions, FHLB members, the NAIC and trade groups developed model legislation that would subject insurers accessing FHLB funding to collateral requirements similar to those applicable to federally insured depository institutions. While members of the FHLB and NAIC were not able to agree on certain points, legislation based on this model has been introduced and adopted in several states and is not being opposed by the NAIC. It is unclear at this time whether or to what extent additional or new legislation or regulatory action regarding continued access to FHLB financial services will be enacted or adopted. Any developments that limit access to FHLB financial services could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
    
  The amount of statutory capital or risk-based capital that the Company has and the amount of statutory capital or risk-based capital that it must hold to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and such amounts are sensitive to a number of factors outside of the Company s control. 
    
  Insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital formulas for life and property and casualty companies. The risk-based capital formula for life insurance companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate, and certain other risks. 
    
  In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors including the following: the amount of statutory income or losses generated by the Company and its insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions); the amount of additional capital which the Company and its insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth; changes in the Company s reserve requirements; the Company s ability to secure capital market solutions to provide reserve relief; changes in equity market levels; the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in its investment portfolio; the credit ratings of investments held in its portfolio, including those issued by, or explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by, a government; the value of certain derivative instruments; changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; credit market volatility; changes in consumer behavior; and changes to the NAIC risk-based capital formula. Most of these factors are outside of the Company s control. The Company s financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by its statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital ratios and those of its insurance company subsidiaries. Rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital the Company must hold in order to maintain its current ratings. In addition, rating agencies may downgrade the investments held in the Company s portfolio, which could result in a reduction of the Company s capital and surplus and/or its risk-based capital ratio. 
    
  In scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves or risk-based capital the Company is required to hold for its variable product guarantees may increase at a rate greater than the rate of change of the markets. Increases in reserves or risk-based capital could result in a reduction to the Company s capital, surplus, and/or risk-based capital ratio. Also, in environments where there is not a correlative relationship between interest rates and spreads, the Company s market value adjusted annuity product can have a material adverse effect on the Company s statutory surplus position. 
    
  The Company may be subject to regulations influenced by or related to international regulatory authorities or initiatives. 
    
  The NAIC and the Company s state regulators may be influenced by the initiatives of international regulatory bodies, and those initiatives may not translate readily into the legal system under which U.S. insurers must operate. There is increasing pressure to conform to international standards due to the globalization of the business of insurance and the most recent financial crisis. In addition to developments at the NAIC and in the United States, the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, and the G20 have issued a series of proposals intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. 
    
  The International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ), at the direction of the FSB, has published a methodology for identifying  global systemically important insurers  ( G-SIIs ) and high level policy measures that will apply to G-SIIs. The FSB, working with national authorities and the IAIS, has designated nine insurance groups as G-SIIs. The IAIS is working on the policy measures which include higher capital requirements and enhanced supervision. Although neither the Company nor Dai-ichi Life has been designated a G-SII, the list of designated insurers will be updated annually by the FSB. It is possible that the greater size and reach of the combined group as a result of the Company becoming a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life, or a change in the methodologies or their application, could lead to the combined group s designation as a G-SII. 
    
  The IAIS is also in the process of developing a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups ( IAIGs ), which is targeted to be implemented in 2019. Under the proposed framework, insurance groups deemed to be IAIGs may be required by their regulators to comply with new global capital requirements, which may exceed the sum of state or other local capital requirements. In addition, the IAIS is developing a model framework for the supervision of IAIGs that  

Table of Contents  

contemplates  group wide supervision  across national boundaries, which requires each IAIG to conduct its own risk and solvency assessment to monitor and manage its overall solvency. It is likely that, as a result of the Merger, the combined group will be deemed an IAIG, in which case it may be subject to supervision and capital requirements beyond those applicable to any competitors who are not designated as an IAIG. 
    
  While it is not yet known how or if these actions will impact the Company, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure, less flexibility in capital management and more burdensome regulation and capital requirements for specific lines of business, and could impact the Company and its reserve and capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  NAIC actions, pronouncements and initiatives may affect the Company s product profitability, reserve and capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Although some NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting, reserving and risk-based capital issues, may take effect automatically without affirmative action taken by the states, the NAIC is not a governmental entity and its processes and procedures do not comport with those to which governmental entities typically adhere. Therefore, it is possible that actions could be taken by the NAIC that become effective without the procedural safeguards that would be present if governmental action was required. In addition, with respect to some financial regulations and guidelines, states sometimes defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of a non-domiciliary state. Neither the action of the domiciliary state nor the action of the NAIC is binding on a non-domiciliary state. Accordingly, a state could choose to follow a different interpretation. The Company is also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s interpretation of a legal, accounting or actuarial issue may result in non-compliance with another regulator s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is an additional risk that any particular regulator s interpretation of a legal, accounting or actuarial issue may change over time to the Company s detriment, or that changes to the overall legal or market environment may cause the Company to change its practices in ways that may, in some cases, limit its growth or profitability. Statutes, regulations, interpretations, and instructions may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting, reserve and risk-based capital requirements. Also, regulatory actions with prospective impact can potentially have a significant impact on currently sold products. 
    
  The NAIC has announced more focused inquiries on certain matters that could have an impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Such inquiries concern, for example, examination of statutory accounting disclosures for separate accounts, insurer use of captive reinsurance companies, variable annuity reserves and capital treatment, certain aspects of insurance holding company reporting and disclosure, reserving for universal life products with secondary guarantees, reinsurance, cybersecurity practices, and risk-based capital calculations. In addition, the NAIC continues to consider various initiatives to change and modernize its financial and solvency requirements and regulations. It has adopted principles-based reserving methodologies for life insurance and annuity reserves, but additional formulas and/or guidance relevant to the new standard are being developed. The NAIC is also considering changes to accounting and risk-based capital regulations, governance practices of insurers, and other items. Some of these proposed changes will require the approval of state legislatures. The Company cannot currently estimate what impact these more focused inquiries or proposed changes, if they occur, will have on its product mix, product profitability, reserve and capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  The Company s use of captive reinsurance companies to finance statutory reserves related to its term and universal life products and to reduce volatility affecting its variable annuity products may be limited or adversely affected by regulatory action, pronouncements and interpretations.  
    
  The Company currently uses affiliated captive reinsurance companies in various structures to finance certain statutory reserves based on a regulation entitled  Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,  commonly known as  Regulation XXX,  and a supporting guideline entitled  The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation,  commonly known as  Guideline AXXX , which are associated with term life insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees, respectively, as well as to reduce the volatility in statutory risk-based capital associated with certain guaranteed minimum withdrawal and death benefit riders associated with the Company s variable annuity products. The NAIC, through various committees, subgroups and dedicated task forces, is reviewing the use of captives and special purpose vehicles used to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations, and could impose additional requirements on the use of captives and other reinsurers (including traditional reinsurers) (the  Affected Business ). In addition, the Principles Based Reserving Implementation (EX) Task Force of the NAIC, charged with analysis of the adoption of a principles-based reserving methodology, adopted the  conceptual framework  contained in a report issued by Rector   Associates, Inc., dated June 4, 2014 (as modified or supplemented, the  Rector Report ), that includes numerous recommendations pertaining to the regulation and use of certain captive reinsurers. Certain high-level recommendations have been adopted and assigned to various NAIC working groups, which working groups are in various stages of discussions regarding recommendations.  
    
  One recommendation of the Rector Report was adopted as Actuarial Guideline XLVIII ( AG48 ). AG48 sets more restrictive standards on the permitted collateral utilized to back reserves of a captive.  In September 2016, the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC adopted the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation (the  Reserve Model ) which is substantially similar to AG48.  AG48 and the Reserve Model will likely make it difficult for the Company to establish new captive financing arrangements on a basis consistent with past practices. As a result of AG48 and the Reserve Model, the implementation of new captive structures in the future may be less capital efficient, may lead to lower product returns and/or increased product pricing or result in reduced sales of certain products. In some circumstances, AG48 and the Reserve Model could impact the Company s ability to engage in certain reinsurance transactions with non-affiliates.     
    
  The Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC established a Variable Annuity Issues Working Group ("VAIWG") in 2015 to oversee the NAIC s efforts to study and address regulatory issues resulting in variable annuity captive reinsurance

transactions. The VAIWG developed a Framework for Change (the  Framework ) which was adopted in 2015. The Framework suggests numerous changes to current NAIC rules and regulations that are intended to decrease incentives for insurers to establish variable annuities captives, which changes could potentially be applied to both in-force and new business. The Framework proposes that various NAIC groups consider and adopt recommended changes to current rules and regulations (with a targeted effective date in 2018) and that, upon adoption, domestic regulators request that insurers ceding business to variable annuity captives recapture such business and dissolve such captives. The VAIWG received a draft proposal for changes in late 2016.  If the proposal is adopted, changes in the regulation of variable annuities and variable annuity captives could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  The NAIC adopted revisions to the Part A Laws and Regulations Preamble (the "Preamble") of the NAIC Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program that will include within the definition of  multi-state insurer  certain insurer-owned captives and special purpose vehicles that are single-state licensed but assume reinsurance from cedants operating in multiple states. The revised definition will subject certain captives, including XXX/AXXX captives, variable annuity and long-term care captives, to all of the accreditation standards applicable to other traditional multi-state insurers, including standards related to capital and surplus requirements, risk-based capital requirements, investment laws and credit for reinsurance laws. Although we do not expect the revised definition to affect our existing life insurance captives (or our ability to engage in life insurance captive transactions in the future), such application will likely prevent us from engaging in variable annuity captive transactions on the same or a similar basis as in the past and, if applied retroactively, would likely cause us to recapture business from and unwind our existing variable annuity captive ( VA Captive ). 
    
  While the recapture of business from our existing VA Captive, caused either by actions of the VAIWG or the effect of the Preamble, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company given current market conditions, in the future the Company could experience fluctuations in its risk-based capital ratio due to market volatility if it were prohibited from engaging in similar transactions or required to unwind its existing VA Captive, which could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Any regulatory action or change in interpretation that materially adversely affects the Company s use or materially increases the Company s cost of using captives or reinsurers for the Affected Business, either retroactively or prospectively, could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. If the Company were required to discontinue its use of captives for intercompany reinsurance transactions on a retroactive basis, adverse impacts would include early termination fees payable with respect to certain structures, diminished capital position and higher cost of capital. Additionally, finding alternative means to support policy liabilities efficiently is an unknown factor that would be dependent, in part, on future market conditions and the Company s ability to obtain required regulatory approvals. On a prospective basis, discontinuation of the use of captives could impact the types, amounts and pricing of products offered by the Company s insurance subsidiaries. 
    
  Laws, regulations and initiatives related to unreported deaths and unclaimed property and death benefits may result in operational burdens, fines, unexpected payments or escheatments. 
    
  Since 2012, various states have enacted laws that require life insurers to search for unreported deaths. The National Conference of Insurance Legislators ( NCOIL ) has adopted the Model Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act (the  Unclaimed Benefits Act ) and legislation or regulations have been enacted in numerous states that are similar to the Unclaimed Benefits Act, although each state s version differs in some respects. The Unclaimed Benefits Act, if adopted by any state, imposes new requirements on insurers to periodically compare their life insurance and annuity contracts and retained asset accounts against the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File or similar databases (a "Death Database"), investigate any potential matches to confirm the death and determine whether benefits are due, and to attempt to locate the beneficiaries of any benefits that are due or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the benefit to the state as unclaimed property. Other states in which the Company does business may also consider adopting legislation similar to the Unclaimed Benefits Act. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be proposed or enacted in additional states. Additionally, the NAIC Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits (A) Working Group is developing a model unclaimed property law that overlaps with the NCOIL-based laws already adopted in numerous states. 
    
  The Uniform Laws Commission has adopted revisions to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act in a manner likely to impact state unclaimed property laws and requirements, though it is not clear at this time to what extent or whether requirements will conflict with otherwise imposed search requirements. Other life insurance industry associations and regulatory associations are also considering these matters. Certain states have amended or may amend their unclaimed property laws to require insurers to compare in-force and certain terminated life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained asset accounts against a Death Database, to investigate potential matches to determine whether the named insured is deceased, to attempt to locate and pay beneficiaries any unclaimed benefits required to be paid, and, if no beneficiary can be located, to escheat policy benefits to the appropriate state as unclaimed property. The enactment of such unclaimed property laws may require the Company to incur significant expenses, including benefits with respect to terminated policies for which no reserves are currently held and unanticipated operational expenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  A number of state treasury departments and administrators of unclaimed property have audited life insurance companies for compliance with unclaimed property laws. The focus of the audits has been to determine whether there have been maturities of policies or contracts, or policies that have exceeded limiting age with respect to which death benefits or other payments under the policies should be treated as unclaimed property that should be escheated to the state. In addition, the audits have sought to identify unreported deaths of insureds. There is no clear basis in previously existing law for treating an unreported death as giving rise to a policy benefit that would be subject to unclaimed property procedures. A number of life insurers, however, have entered into resolution agreements with state treasury departments and administrators of unclaimed property under which the life insurers  

Table of Contents  

agreed to procedures for comparing their previously issued life insurance and annuity contracts and retained asset accounts against a Death Database, treating confirmed deaths as giving rise to a death benefit under their policies, locating beneficiaries and paying them the benefits and interest, escheating the benefits and interest, in some cases at a negotiated rate, to the state if the beneficiary could not be found, and paying penalties to the state, if required. The amounts publicly reported to have been paid to beneficiaries and/or escheated to the states have been substantial. 
    
  The NAIC has established an Investigations of Life/Annuity Claims Settlement Practices (D) Task Force to coordinate targeted multi-state examinations of life insurance companies on claims settlement practices. The state insurance regulators on the Task Force have initiated targeted multi-state examinations of life insurance companies with respect to the companies  claims paying practices and use of a Death Database to identify unreported deaths in their life insurance policies, annuity contracts and retained asset accounts. There is no clear basis in previously existing law for requiring a life insurer to search for unreported deaths in order to determine whether a benefit is owed. A number of life insurers, however, have entered into settlement or consent agreements with state insurance regulators under which the life insurers agreed to implement systems and procedures for periodically comparing their life insurance and annuity contracts and retained asset accounts against a Death Database, treating confirmed deaths as giving rise to a death benefit under their policies, locating beneficiaries and paying them the benefits and interest, escheating the benefits and interest to the state if the beneficiary could not be found, and paying penalties to the state, if required. It has been publicly reported that the life insurers have paid substantial administrative and/or examination fees to the insurance regulators in connection with the settlement or consent agreements. 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries as well as certain other insurance companies from whom the Company has coinsured blocks of life insurance and annuity policies are subject to unclaimed property audits and/or targeted multi-state examinations by insurance regulators similar to those described above. It is possible that the audits, examinations and/or the enactment of state laws similar to the Unclaimed Benefits Act could result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, payment of administrative penalties and/or examination fees to state authorities, and changes to the Company s procedures for identifying unreported deaths and escheatment of abandoned property. It is possible any such additional payments and any costs related to changes in Company procedures could materially impact the Company s financial results from operations. It is also possible that life insurers, including the Company, may be subject to claims, regulatory actions, law enforcement actions, and civil litigation arising from their prior business practices, unclaimed property practices or related audits and examinations. Any resulting liabilities, payments or costs, including initial and ongoing costs of changes to the Company s procedures or systems, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  During December 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed actions against the Company and one of its subsidiaries West Coast Life Insurance Company, in West Virginia state court (State of West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Protective Life Insurance Company, State of West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. West Coast Life Insurance Company; Defendants  Motions to Dismiss granted on December 27, 2013; Notice of Appeal filed on January 27, 2014; dismissal reversed by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals on June 16, 2015; Petition for Rehearing filed by Defendant insurance companies denied on September 21, 2015). The actions, which also name numerous other life insurance companies, allege that the companies violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, seek to compel compliance with the Act, and seek payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. While the legal theory or theories that may give rise to liability in the West Virginia Treasurer litigation are uncertain, it is possible that other jurisdictions may pursue similar actions. The Company does not currently believe that losses, if any, arising from the West Virginia Treasurer litigation will be material. The Company cannot, however, predict whether other jurisdictions will pursue similar actions or, if they do, whether such actions will have a material impact on the Company s financial results from operations. 
    
  The Company is subject to insurance guaranty fund and insurable interest laws which could result in assessments that adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Under insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. From time to time, companies may be asked to contribute amounts beyond prescribed limits. It is possible that the Company could be assessed with respect to product lines not offered by the Company. The Company cannot predict the amount of timing of any future assessments, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Laws, rules and regulations promulgated in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may adversely affect the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank ) enacted in July 2010 made sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Certain provisions of Dodd-Frank are or may become applicable to the Company, its competitors or those entities with which the Company does business. Such provisions include, but are not limited to the following: the establishment of consolidated federal regulation and resolution authority over systemically important financial services firms, the establishment of the Federal Insurance Office, changes to the regulation and standards applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisors, changes to the regulation of reinsurance, changes to regulations affecting the rights of shareowners, and the imposition of additional regulation over credit rating agencies, and the imposition of concentration limits on financial institutions that restrict the amount of credit that may be extended to a single person or entity. Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank, many regulations have been enacted and others are likely to be adopted in the future that will have an impact upon the Company. Dodd-Frank also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the  FSOC ), which has issued a final rule and interpretive guidance setting forth the methodology by which it will determine whether a non-bank financial company is a systemically important financial institution ( SIFI ). A non- bank financial company, such as the Company, that is designated as a SIFI by the FSOC will become subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal  

Table of Contents  

Reserve ). The Company is not currently supervised by the Federal Reserve as a SIFI. Such supervision could impact the Company s requirements relating to capital, liquidity, stress testing, limits on counterparty credit exposure, compliance and governance, early remediation in the event of financial weakness and other prudential matters, and in other ways the Company currently cannot anticipate. FSOC-designated non-bank financial companies will also be required to prepare resolution plans, so-called  living wills,  that set out how they could most efficiently be liquidated if they endangered the U.S. financial system or the broader economy. The FSOC has conducted multiple rounds of SIFI designation consideration. However, this process is still new, and the FSOC continues to make changes to its process for designating a company as a SIFI. The FSOC has made its initial SIFI designations, and the Company was not designated as such. However, the Company could be considered and designated at any time. Because the process is in its initial stages, the Company is at this time unable to predict the impact on an entity that is supervised as a SIFI by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is not able to predict whether the capital requirements or other requirements imposed on SIFIs may impact the requirements applicable to the Company even if it is not designated as a SIFI. The uncertainty about regulatory requirements could influence the Company s product line or other business decisions with respect to some product lines.  
    
  There is a similarly uncertain international designation process. The Financial Stability Board, appointed by the G-20 Summit, recently designated nine insurers as  G-SIIs,  or global systemically-important insurers. The insurers designated as G-SIIs to date represent organizations larger than the Company, but the possibility remains that the Company could be so designated.  As with the designation of SIFIs, it is unclear at this time how additional capital, use of potentially systemic non-insurance activities and product features, and other requirements affect the insurance and financial industries.  
    
  Additionally, Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), an independent division of the Department of Treasury with jurisdiction over credit, savings, payment, and other consumer financial products and services, other than investment products already regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) or the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFPB has supervisory authority over certain non-banks whose activities or products it determines pose risks to consumers, and recently issued a rule amending regulations under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act that will require the Company to, among other things, collect and disclose extensive data related to its lending practices. It is unclear at this time the extent to which the Company or its activities or products will be impacted by this rule or other rules promulgated by the CFPB, or how burdensome compliance will become.  
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries sell products that may be regulated by the CFPB. CFPB continues to bring enforcement actions involving a growing number of issues, including actions brought jointly with state Attorneys General, which could directly or indirectly affect the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Additionally, the CFPB is exploring the possibility of helping Americans manage their retirement savings and is considering the extent of its authority in that area. The Company is unable at this time to predict the impact of these activities on the Company. 
    
  Dodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives markets which requires clearing of certain types of transactions which have been or are currently traded OTC by the Company. The types of transactions to be cleared are expected to increase in the future. The new framework could potentially impose additional costs, including increased margin requirements and additional regulation on the Company. Increased margin requirements on the Company s part, combined with restrictions on securities that will qualify as eligible collateral, could continue to reduce its liquidity and require an increase in its holdings of cash and government securities with lower yields causing a reduction in income. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with its businesses, including those arising from its variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features. The derivative clearing requirements of Dodd-Frank could continue to increase the cost of the Company s risk mitigation and expose it to the risk of a default by a clearinghouse with respect to the Company s cleared derivative transactions. 
    
  Numerous provisions of Dodd-Frank require the adoption of implementing rules and/or regulations. The process of adopting such implementing rules and/or regulations have in some instances been delayed beyond the timeframes imposed by Dodd-Frank. Until the various final regulations are promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the full impact of the regulations on the Company will remain unclear. In addition, Dodd-Frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance industry, the Company, its competitors or the entities with which the Company does business. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with Dodd-Frank may impact the Company in many ways, including but not limited to the following: placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competition or other financial services entities, changing the competitive landscape of the financial services sector and/or the insurance industry, making it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, requiring the reallocation of significant company resources to government affairs, legal and compliance-related activities, causing historical market behavior or statistics utilized by the Company in connection with its efforts to manage risk and exposure to no longer be predictive of future risk and exposure or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate as well as the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Regulations issued by the Department of Labor on April 6, 2016, expanding the definition of  investment advice fiduciary  under ERISA and creating and revising several prohibited transaction exemptions for investment activities in light of that expanded definition, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell annuities and other products, to retain in-force business and on our financial condition or results of operation. 
    
  Broker-dealers, insurance agencies and other financial institutions sell the Company s annuities to employee benefit plans governed by provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) and Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) that are governed by similar provisions under the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). Consequently, our activities and those of the firms that sell the Company s products are subject to restrictions that require ERISA fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that prohibit ERISA fiduciaries from causing a covered plan or  

Table of Contents  

retirement account to engage in certain prohibited transactions absent an exemption. In general, the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code restrict the receipt of compensation from third parties in connection with the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and IRAs. 
    
  On April 6, 2016, the Department of Labor issued new regulations expanding the definition of  investment advice fiduciary  under ERISA. These new regulations increase the number of circumstances in which the Company and broker-dealers, insurance agencies and other financial institutions that sell the Company s products could be deemed a fiduciary when providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans or IRAs. The Department of Labor also issued amendments to long-standing exemptions from the provisions of ERISA and the Code that prohibit fiduciaries from engaging in certain types of transactions ( Prohibited Transaction Exemptions ) and adopted new Prohibited Transaction Exemptions. These amended and new Prohibited Transaction Exemptions appear to increase significantly the conditions that must be satisfied by fiduciaries in order to receive traditional forms of commission, such as sales commissions, for sales of insurance products to ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. 
    
  Although it is expected that that the Department of Labor may provide additional interpretive guidance with respect to these new regulations, it appears that sales of certain of our products may be materially and adversely affected and our current distributors may limit the number of products they offer, including the types of products offered by the Company. The Company may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation, to limit the assistance or advice it can provide to owners of the Company s annuities, to replace or engage additional distributors, or otherwise change the manner in which it designs and supports sales of its annuities. In addition, the Company may incur significant expenses in connection with initial and ongoing compliance obligations with respect to such rules. The foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell annuities and other products, to retain in-force business, and on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Changes to tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could adversely affect the Company and its ability to compete with non-insurance products or reduce the demand for certain insurance products. 
    
  Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), income taxes payable by policyholders on investment earnings on most life insurance and annuity products are deferred during their accumulation period. This favorable tax treatment provides some of the Company s products with a competitive advantage over products offered by non-insurance companies. To the extent that the Code is revised to either reduce the tax-deferred status of life insurance and annuity products, or to establish the tax-deferred status of competing products, then all life insurance companies, including the Company s subsidiaries, would be adversely affected with respect to their ability to sell their products. Furthermore, depending upon grandfathering provisions, such changes could cause increased surrenders of existing life insurance and annuity products. For example, future legislation that further restricts the deductibility of interest on funds borrowed to purchase corporate-owned life insurance products could result in increased surrenders of these products. 
    
  The Company is subject to the federal corporate income tax in the U.S. Certain tax provisions, such as the dividends-received deduction, the deferral of current taxation on derivatives  and securities  economic income, and the deduction for future policy benefits and claims, are beneficial to the Company. The Obama Administration and Congress have each made proposals that either materially change or eliminate these benefits. Most of the foregoing proposals would cause the Company to pay higher current taxes, offset (in whole or in part) by a reduction in its deferred taxes. However, the proposal regarding the dividends-received deduction would cause the Company s net income to decrease. Whether these proposals will be enacted, and if so, whether they will be enacted as described above, is uncertain. 
    
  The Company s mid-2005 transition from relying on reinsurance for newly-written traditional life products to reinsuring some of these products  reserves into its captive insurance companies resulted in a net reduction in its current taxes, offset by an increase in its deferred taxes. The resulting benefit of reduced current taxes is attributed to the applicable life products and is an important component of the profitability of these products. The profitability and competitive position of these products is dependent on the continuation of current tax law and the ability to generate taxable income. 
    
  There is general uncertainty regarding the taxes to which the Company and its products will be subject in the future. The Company cannot predict what changes to tax law or interpretations of existing tax law may ultimately be enacted or adopted, or whether such changes will adversely affect the Company. 
    
  The Company s reinsurers could fail to meet assumed obligations, increase rates, terminate agreements or be subject to adverse developments that could affect the Company. 
    
  The Company and its insurance subsidiaries cede material amounts of insurance and transfer related assets to other insurance companies through reinsurance. However, notwithstanding the transfer of related assets or other issues, the Company remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the assumed obligations. Therefore, the failure, insolvency, or inability or unwillingness to pay under the terms of the reinsurance agreement with the Company of one or more of the Company s reinsurers could negatively impact the Company s earnings and financial position. 
    
  The Company s results and its ability to compete are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance. Premium rates charged by the Company are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Certain reinsurers may attempt to increase the rates they charge the Company for reinsurance, including rates for new policies the Company is issuing and rates related to policies that the Company has already issued. The Company may not be able to increase the premium rates it charges for policies it has already issued, and for competitive reasons it may not be able to raise the premium rates it charges for new policies to offset the increase in rates charged by reinsurers. If the cost of reinsurance were to increase, if reinsurance were  

Table of Contents  

to become unavailable, if alternatives to reinsurance were not available to the Company, or if a reinsurer should fail to meet its obligations, the Company could be adversely affected. 
    
  Over the last several years, the number of life reinsurers has decreased as the reinsurance industry has consolidated.  The decreased number of participants in the life reinsurance market over time has resulted in increased concentration of risk for insurers, including the Company.  If the reinsurance market further contracts, the Company s ability to continue to offer its products on terms favorable to it could be adversely impacted.   
    
  In addition, reinsurers face challenges regarding illiquid credit and/or capital markets, investment downgrades, rating agency downgrades, deterioration of general economic conditions, and other factors negatively impacting the financial services industry. If reinsurers, including those with significant exposure to international markets and European Union member states, are unable to meet their obligations, the Company would be adversely impacted. 
    
  The Company has implemented a reinsurance program through the use of captive reinsurers. Under these arrangements, a captive owned by the Company serves as the reinsurer, and the consolidated books and tax returns of the Company reflects a liability consisting of the full reserve amount attributable to the reinsured business. The success of the Company s captive reinsurance program is dependent on a number of factors outside the control of the Company, including continued access to financial solutions, a favorable regulatory environment, and the overall tax position of the Company. If the captive reinsurance program is not successful, the Company s financial condition could be adversely impacted.

  CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS RATIOS 

The following table sets forth, for the years and periods ended, Protective Life Insurance Company s (the  Company ) ratios of: 
    
                         Consolidated earnings to fixed charges. 
                         Consolidated earnings to fixed charges before interest credited on investment products. 

(1)  The Company calculates the ratio of  Consolidated Earnings to Fixed Charges  by dividing the sum of income from continuing operations before income tax (BT), interest expense (which includes an estimate of the interest component of operating lease expense) (I) and interest credited on investment products (IP) by the sum of interest expense (I) and interest credited on investment products (IP). The formula for this ratio is: (BT+I+IP)(I+IP). The Company continues to sell investment products that credit interest to the contract holder. Investment products include products such as guaranteed investment contracts, annuities, and variable universal life interest credited insurance policies. The inclusion of interest credited on investment products results in a negative impact on the ratio of earnings to fixed charges because the effect of increases in interest credited to contract holders more than offsets the effect of the increase in earnings. 
  (2)  The Company calculates the ratio of  Consolidated Earnings to Fixed Charges Before Interest Credited on Investment Products  by dividing the sum of income from continuing operations before income tax (BT) and interest expense (I) by interest expense (I). The formula for this calculation, therefore, would be: (BT+I)/I.

    Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
