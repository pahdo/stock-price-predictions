Note 1.  Partnership Operations, Organization and Basis of Presentation

We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  EPD.   We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquid ( NGL ) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States ( U.S. ), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets.  Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals (including liquefied petroleum gas, or  LPG  crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage and terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems.  Our assets currently include approximately 49,000 miles of pipelines; 250 million barrels ( MMBbls ) of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 billion cubic feet ( Bcf ) of natural gas storage capacity.  

We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective.  Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us.  We, Enterprise GP, EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC are affiliates under the collective common control of the DD LLC Trustees and the EPCO Trustees.  Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees. All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the  ASA ) or by other service providers. See Note 13 for information regarding the ASA and other related party matters.

Our historical operations are reported under five business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines   Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, (iv) Petrochemical   Refined Products Services and (v) Offshore Pipelines   Services. On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines   Services segment. Our consolidated financial statements reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015. See Note 9 for additional information regarding our business segments.

As a result of our acquisition of the member interests of EFS Midstream effective July 1, 2015, we began consolidating the financial statements of EFS Midstream as of that date.

Effective January 1, 2016, we applied the provisions of Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires bond issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt. The guidance was applied on a retrospective basis; therefore, we adjusted our December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the reclassification of $14.7 million of bond issuance costs from prepaid and other current assets and $135.1 million from other assets to reduce the carrying amount of long-term debt by an aggregate $149.8 million. See Note 7 for additional information regarding our long-term debt.

Note 2.  General Accounting and Disclosure Matters

Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full year of 2016.  In our opinion, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary for fair presentation.  Although we believe the disclosures in these financial statements are adequate and make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ) filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Contingencies

Certain conditions may exist as of the date our consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  Management has regular quarterly litigation reviews, including updates from legal counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise in judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, our management and legal counsel evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

We accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.  We do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote.  For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the impact would be material to our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.  See Note 14 for additional information regarding our contingencies.

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, forward contracts and other arrangements to manage price risks associated with inventories, firm commitments, interest rates and certain anticipated future commodity transactions.  To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedged item must expose us to risk and the related derivative instrument must reduce the exposure to that risk and meet specific hedge documentation requirements related to designation dates, expectations for hedge effectiveness and the probability that hedged future transactions will occur as forecasted.  We formally designate derivative instruments as hedges and document and assess their effectiveness at inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis thereafter.  Forecasted transactions are evaluated for the probability of occurrence and are periodically back-tested once the forecasted period has passed to determine whether similarly forecasted transactions are probable of occurring in the future.

For certain physical forward commodity derivative contracts, we apply the normal purchase/normal sale exception, whereby changes in the mark-to-market values of such contracts are not recognized in income.  As a result, the revenues and expenses associated with such physical transactions are recognized during the period when volumes are physically delivered or received.  Physical forward commodity contracts subject to this exception are evaluated for the probability of future delivery and are periodically back-tested once the forecasted period has passed to determine whether similar forward contracts are probable of physical delivery in the future.  See Note 12 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.

Estimates

Preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts presented in the financial statements.  Our most significant estimates relate to: (i) the useful lives and depreciation/amortization methods used for fixed and identifiable intangible assets; (ii) measurement of fair value and projections used in impairment testing of fixed and intangible assets (including goodwill); (iii) contingencies; and (iv) revenue and expense accruals.

Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.  On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information.  Any changes in the facts and circumstances underlying our estimates may require us to update such estimates, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements

Our fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk, in the principal market of the asset or liability at a specified measurement date.  Recognized valuation techniques employ inputs such as contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, operating costs, discount factors and business growth rates.  These inputs may be either readily observable, corroborated by market data or generally unobservable.  In developing our estimates of fair value, we endeavor to utilize the best information available and apply market-based data to the highest extent possible.  Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques (such as the market approach) that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

A three-tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized in the financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair values.  The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3).  At each balance sheet reporting date, we categorize our financial assets and liabilities using this hierarchy.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products.  Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices fluctuate or margin requirements change.  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our restricted cash amounts were $277.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively.  The balance at September 30, 2016 consisted of initial margin requirements of $48.9 million and variation margin requirements of $228.4 million. The initial margin requirements will be returned to us as the related derivative instruments are settled.  Our variation margin requirements increased by $248.7 million since December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher forward commodity prices for NGLs and related hydrocarbons during 2016 relative to our short financial derivative positions in these products.  See Note 12 for information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Note 3.  Inventories

Our inventory amounts by product type were as follows at the dates indicated:

Our inventories, and associated working capital commitments, have increased significantly since December 31, 2015 primarily due to our marketing groups taking advantage of contango opportunities using our storage assets.  We expect to gradually settle these inventory positions (valued at approximately $1 billion) through the first quarter of 2017, with a corresponding decrease in working capital commitments and related debt.

The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life as a component of depreciation expense. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise.

Fire at Pascagoula Facility

We acquired the remaining 60% undivided interest in the Pascagoula natural gas processing facility (the  Pascagoula Facility ) for $35.0 million in March 2016 and assumed operatorship of the facility on June 1, 2016.  The facility is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi and processes natural gas received from third-party production developments located in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  On June 27, 2016, we experienced a fire at the facility, which remains out of service as a result of damage sustained during the fire.  Repairs to this location have commenced and the facility is expected to return to commercial service during the fourth quarter of 2016.

As a result of this event, we recorded a $7.1 million non-cash loss in the second quarter of 2016 attributable to assets damaged in the fire. In addition, we incurred $7.1 million of expense during the third quarter of 2016 for fire response activities at the Pascagoula Facility. We will capitalize those expenditures we incur to rebuild the facility.

Under our current insurance program, the standalone deductible for property damage claims is $55 million.  We also have business interruption protection; however, such claims must involve physical damage and have a combined loss value in excess of $55 million and the period of interruption must exceed 60 days.  We continue to evaluate the possibility of filing an insurance claim related to this event.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record asset retirement obligations ( AROs ) in connection with legal requirements to perform specified retirement activities under contractual arrangements and/or governmental regulations.  Our contractual AROs primarily result from right-of-way agreements associated with our pipeline operations and real estate leases associated with our plant sites.  In addition, we record AROs in connection with governmental regulations associated with the abandonment or retirement of above-ground brine storage pits and certain marine vessels.  We also record AROs in connection with regulatory requirements associated with the renovation or demolition of certain assets containing hazardous substances such as asbestos.  We typically fund our AROs using cash flow from operations.

Property, plant and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 includes $21.1 million and $17.6 million, respectively, of asset retirement costs capitalized as an increase in the associated long-lived asset.

The following table presents information regarding our AROs since December 31, 2015:

At December 31, 2015, we reclassified $149.8 million of bond issuance costs, which were previously accounted for as assets on our consolidated balance sheet, to long-term debt in connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-03 (see Note 1). These amounts are a component of  Other, non-principal amounts  in the preceding table.

The following table presents contractually scheduled maturities of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at September 30, 2016 for the next five years, and in total thereafter:

Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationships

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. acts as guarantor of the consolidated debt obligations of EPO, with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO.  If EPO were to default on any of its guaranteed debt, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. would be responsible for full and unconditional repayment of that obligation.

Issuance of $1.25 Billion of Senior Notes in April 2016

In April 2016, EPO issued $575 million in principal amount of 2.85% senior notes due April 2021 ( Senior Notes RR ), $575 million in principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due February 2027 ( Senior Notes SS ) and $100 million in principal amount of 4.90% reopened senior notes due May 2046 ( Senior Notes QQ ).  Senior Notes RR, SS and QQ were issued at 99.898%, 99.760% and 95.516% of their principal amounts, respectively. We issued these senior notes using our 2013 Shelf (see Note 8).

Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used as follows: (i) the repayment of amounts then outstanding under EPO s commercial paper program, which included amounts we used to repay $750 million in principal amount of Senior Notes AA that matured in February 2016, and (ii) for general company purposes.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed these senior notes on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.  These senior notes rank equal with EPO s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO.  These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO s ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions.

364-Day Credit Agreement

In September 2016, EPO amended its 364-Day Credit Agreement to extend its maturity date to September 2017.  There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.  Under the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.  To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2018.  The remaining terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, as amended, remain materially the same as those reported for the 364-Day Credit Agreement in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Letters of Credit

At September 30, 2016, EPO had $67.7 million of letters of credit outstanding primarily related to our commodity hedging activities.

Lender Financial Covenants

We were in compliance with the financial covenants of our consolidated debt agreements at September 30, 2016.

Information Regarding Variable Interest Rates Paid

The following table presents the range of interest rates and weighted-average interest rates paid on our consolidated variable-rate debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Note 8.  Equity and Distributions

Partners Equity

Partners  equity reflects the limited partner interests (i.e., common units, including restricted common units) that we have outstanding.  The following table summarizes changes in the number of our outstanding units from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016:

The net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common units during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were used to temporarily reduce principal amounts outstanding under EPO s commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and for general company purposes.

We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending.

Universal shelf registration statement 

On May 12, 2016, we filed with the SEC a new universal shelf registration statement (the  2016 Shelf ), which was immediately effective and replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2013 (the  2013 Shelf ).   The 2016 Shelf allows (and the prior 2013 Shelf allowed) Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. See Note 7 for information regarding an offering of senior notes we completed in April 2016 using the 2013 Shelf.

At-the-Market ( ATM ) program 

On July 11, 2016, we filed an amended registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.89 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings.  Pursuant to the ATM program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers  transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement.  The new registration statement was declared effective on July 14, 2016 and replaced our prior registration statement with respect to the ATM program.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 76,113,492 common units under the ATM program for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.87 billion.  This includes 3,830,256 common units sold in January 2016 to privately held affiliates of EPCO, which generated gross proceeds of $100 million.  After taking into account applicable costs, our transactions under the ATM program resulted in aggregate net cash proceeds of $1.85 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we issued 23,258,453 common units under this program for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $767.1 million, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $759.7 million. This includes 3,225,057 common units sold in March 2015 to a privately held affiliate of EPCO, which generated gross proceeds of $100 million.  Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through September 30, 2016, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $1.75 billion.

Distribution reinvestment plan 

On May 12, 2016, we filed with the SEC a new registration statement in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP ), which was immediately effective and amended a prior registration statement filed in March 2010.  The new registration statement increased the aggregate number of our common units authorized for issuance under the DRIP from 140,000,000 to 240,000,000.  The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units.

We issued a total of 12,946,724 common units under our DRIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which generated net cash proceeds of $306.2 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we issued 7,965,318 common units under our DRIP, which generated net cash proceeds of $242.8 million.  Privately held affiliates of EPCO reinvested $100 million through the DRIP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (this amount being a component of the net cash proceeds presented).

After taking into account the new registration statement and the number of common units issued under the DRIP through September 30, 2016, we have the capacity to issue an additional 102,121,274 common units under this plan.

Employee unit purchase plan 

In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to 8,000,000 of our common units in connection with our employee unit purchase plan ( EUPP ).  We issued 387,834 common units under our EUPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which generated net cash proceeds of $9.8 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we issued 285,997 common units under our EUPP, which generated net cash proceeds of $8.9 million.  After taking into account the number of common units issued under the EUPP through September 30, 2016, we may issue an additional 6,384,672 common units under this plan.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests represent third party equity ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries (e.g., joint venture partners in entities in which we have a controlling ownership interest).

Distributions paid to partners during 2015 reflected the exclusion of 35,380,000 Designated Units. The temporary distribution waiver expired in November 2015; therefore, distributions paid to partners during calendar year 2016 are payable on all outstanding common units.

Note 9.  Business Segments

Our historical operations are reported under five business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines   Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, (iv) Petrochemical   Refined Products Services and (v) Offshore Pipelines   Services.  On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines   Services segment.  Our consolidated financial statements reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015.

Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold.  Financial information regarding these segments is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating and financial performance.

Segment revenues include intersegment and intrasegment transactions, which are generally based on transactions made at market-based rates.  Our consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of intercompany transactions.  Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base.

We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin.  Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results.  The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income.

Gross operating margin represents GAAP operating income exclusive of (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, (ii) impairment charges, (iii) gains and losses attributable to asset sales, insurance recoveries and related property damage and (iv) general and administrative costs.  Gross operating margin includes (i) equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) non-refundable deferred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights of committed shippers on certain pipeline assets.  Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges.  Gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests.  Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses from segment revenues, with both segment totals reflecting the adjustments noted above, as applicable, and before the elimination of intercompany transactions.

Segment assets consist of property, plant and equipment, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, intangible assets and goodwill.  The carrying values of such amounts are assigned to each segment based on each asset s or investment s principal operations and contribution to the gross operating margin of that particular segment.  Since construction-in-progress amounts (a component of property, plant and equipment) generally do not contribute to segment gross operating margin, such amounts are excluded from segment asset totals until the underlying assets are placed in service.  Intangible assets and goodwill are assigned to each segment based on the classification of the assets to which they relate.  The remainder of our consolidated total assets, which consist primarily of working capital assets, are excluded from segment assets since these amounts are not attributable to one specific segment (e.g. cash).

Substantially all of our plants, pipelines and other fixed assets are located in the U.S.

The following table presents additional information regarding our consolidated revenues and costs and expenses for the periods indicated:

Fluctuations in our product sales revenues and related cost of sales amounts are explained in part by changes in energy commodity prices.  In general, lower energy commodity prices result in a decrease in our revenues attributable to product sales; however, these lower commodity prices also decrease the associated cost of sales as purchase costs decline.  The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.

At September 30, 2016, EPCO s significant long-term incentive plans applicable to us were the Enterprise Products 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 1998 Plan ) and the 2008 Enterprise Products Long-Term Incentive Plan (Third Amendment and Restatement) ( 2008 Plan ).  Up to 14,000,000 of our common units may be issued as awards under the 1998 Plan.  The maximum number of common units authorized for issuance under the 2008 Plan was 35,000,000 at September 30, 2016.  This authorized amount will automatically increase under the terms of the 2008 Plan by 5,000,000 common units on January 1, 2017 and will continue to automatically increase annually on January 1 thereafter during the term of the 2008 Plan; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum aggregate number exceed 70,000,000 common units.  After giving effect to awards granted under the 1998 Plan and 2008 Plan through September 30, 2016, a total of 3,255,545 and 18,297,995 additional common units were available for issuance under these plans, respectively.

In addition, during the first half of 2016, EPCO formed four limited partnerships (generally referred to as  Employee Partnerships ) to serve as incentive arrangements for key employees of EPCO by providing them a  profits interest  in an Employee Partnership. The names of the Employee Partnerships are EPD PubCo Unit I L.P. ( PubCo I ), EPD PubCo Unit II L.P. ( PubCo II ), EPD PubCo Unit III L.P. ( PubCo III )  and EPD PrivCo Unit I L.P. ( PrivCo I ).  The Employee Partnerships are discussed later in this note.

Phantom Unit Awards

Phantom unit awards allow recipients to acquire our common units (at no cost to the recipient apart from fulfilling service and other conditions) once a defined vesting period expires, subject to customary forfeiture provisions.  Phantom unit awards generally vest at a rate of 25% per year beginning one year after the grant date and are non-vested until the required service periods expire.

At September 30, 2016, substantially all of our phantom unit awards are expected to result in the issuance of common units upon vesting; therefore, the applicable awards are accounted for as equity-classified awards.  The grant date fair value of a phantom unit award is based on the market price per unit of our common units on the date of grant.  Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value, net of an allowance for estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service or vesting period.

The following table presents phantom unit award activity for the period indicated:

Our long-term incentive plans provide for the issuance of distribution equivalent rights ( DERs ) in connection with phantom unit awards.  A DER entitles the participant to nonforfeitable cash payments equal to the product of the number of phantom unit awards outstanding for the participant and the cash distribution per common unit paid to our common unitholders.  Cash payments made in connection with DERs are charged to partners  equity when the phantom unit award is expected to result in the issuance of common units; otherwise, such amounts are expensed.

The following table presents supplemental information regarding phantom unit awards for the periods indicated:

ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the EPCO group of companies, the unrecognized compensation cost associated with phantom unit awards was $99.7 million at September 30, 2016, of which our share of the cost is currently estimated to be $89.9 million.  Due to the graded vesting provisions of these awards, we expect to recognize our share of the unrecognized compensation cost for these awards over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Restricted Common Unit Awards

Restricted common unit awards allow recipients to acquire our common units (at no cost to the recipient apart from fulfilling service and other conditions) once a defined vesting period expires, subject to customary forfeiture provisions.  Restricted common unit awards generally vest at a rate of 25% per year beginning one year after the grant date and are non-vested until the required service periods expire.  Restricted common units are included in the number of common units outstanding as presented on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The fair value of a restricted common unit award is based on the market price per unit of our common units on the date of grant.  Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value, net of an allowance for estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service or vesting period.

The following table presents restricted common unit award activity for the period indicated:

Each recipient of a restricted common unit award is entitled to nonforfeitable cash distributions equal to the product of the number of restricted common units outstanding for the participant and the cash distribution per unit paid to our common unitholders.  These distributions are included in  Cash distributions paid to limited partners  as presented on our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

The following table presents supplemental information regarding restricted common unit awards for the periods indicated:

For the EPCO group of companies, the unrecognized compensation cost associated with restricted common unit awards was an aggregate $1.9 million at September 30, 2016, of which our share of the cost is currently estimated to be $1.4 million.  We expect to recognize our share of the unrecognized compensation cost for these awards by the end of 2017.

Unit Option Awards

EPCO s long-term incentive plans provide for the issuance of non-qualified incentive options denominated in our common units.  All of our unit option awards had been exercised as of December 31, 2015 and no new unit option awards were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

In order to fund its unit option award-related obligations, EPCO purchased our common units at fair value directly from us.  When employees exercise unit option awards, we reimburse EPCO for the cash difference between the strike price paid by the employee and the actual purchase price paid by EPCO for the units issued to the employee.

The following table presents supplemental information regarding unit option awards during the periods indicated:

Profits Interest Awards

On February 22, 2016, EPCO Holdings Inc. ( EPCO Holdings ), a privately held affiliate of EPCO, contributed the following Enterprise common units it owned to the Employee Partnerships: (i) 2,723,052 units to PubCo I, (ii) 2,834,198 units to PubCo II and (iii) 1,111,438 units to PrivCo I.  On April 6, 2016, EPCO Holdings contributed 105,000 Enterprise common units it owned to PubCo III.  In exchange for these contributions, EPCO Holdings was admitted as the Class A limited partner of each Employee Partnership. Also on the applicable contribution date, certain key EPCO employees were issued Class B limited partner interests (i.e., profits interest awards) and admitted as Class B limited partners of each Employee Partnership, all without any capital contribution by such employees.  EPCO serves as the general partner of each Employee Partnership.

In general, the Class A limited partner earns a preferred return (the  Class A Preference Return,  as described below) on its investment (or  Capital Base ) in each Employee Partnership, with any residual cash amounts being paid to the Class B limited partners of such Employee Partnership on a quarterly basis. Upon liquidation of an Employee Partnership, assets having a then current fair market value equal to the Class A limited partner s Capital Base in such Employee Partnership, plus any preferred return for the period in which liquidation occurs, will be distributed to the Class A limited partner. Any remaining assets of such Employee Partnership will be distributed to the Class B limited partners of such Employee Partnership as a residual profits interest, which represents the appreciation in value of the Employee Partnership s assets since the date of EPCO Holdings  contribution to it, as described above.

Unless otherwise agreed to by EPCO and a majority in interest of the limited partners of each Employee Partnership, such Employee Partnership will terminate at the earliest to occur of (i) 30 days following its vesting date, (ii) a change of control or (iii) a dissolution of the Employee Partnership.  The Class B limited partner interests in each Employee Partnership vest as follows:   PubCo I, four years from February 22, 2016; PubCo II and PrivCo I, five years from February 22, 2016; and PubCo III, four years from April 6, 2016.

Individually, each Class B limited partner interest is subject to forfeiture if the participating employee s employment with EPCO is terminated prior to vesting, with customary exceptions for death, disability and certain retirements. The risk of forfeiture will also lapse upon certain change of control events. Forfeited individual Class B limited partner interests are allocated to the remaining Class B limited partners.

(1)     Represents fair market value of the Enterprise common units contributed to each Employee Partnership at the applicable contribution date. 

(2)     For each period and Employee Partnership, the Class A Preference Return amount equals the Class A Capital Base, after adjusting for certain retained cash distributions and other amounts as defined in the underlying agreements, multiplied by the applicable Class A Partner Preferred Return Rate divided by 365 or 366 days, as the case may be during such calendar year, multiplied by the number of days in the applicable period.

We expect to recognize our share of the unrecognized compensation cost for PubCo I, PubCo II, PubCo III and PrivCo I over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years, 4.4 years, 3.5 years and 4.4 years, respectively. 

The grant date fair value of each Employee Partnership is based on (i) the estimated value (as determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model) of such Employee Partnership s assets that would be distributed to the Class B limited partners thereof upon liquidation and (ii) the value, based on a discounted cash flow analysis, of the residual quarterly cash amounts that such Class B limited partners are expected to receive over the life of the Employee Partnership.

The following table summarizes the assumptions we used in applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive that portion of the estimated grant date fair value of the profits interest awards for each Employee Partnership:

Compensation expense attributable to the profits interest awards is based on the estimated grant date fair value of each award. A portion of the fair value of these equity-based awards is allocated to us under the ASA as a non-cash expense. We are not responsible for reimbursing EPCO for any expenses of the Employee Partnerships, including the value of any contributions of units made by EPCO Holdings.

Note 12.  Derivative Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements

In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.  In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics.  Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities.

Interest Rate Hedging Activities

We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements.  This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings.

The following table summarizes our portfolio of interest rate swaps at September 30, 2016:

As a result of lower market interest rates in June and July 2016, we entered into eight 30-year forward-starting swaps associated with anticipated future issuances of debt. At September 30, 2016, our portfolio of forward starting swaps was as follows:

As a result of market conditions in October 2016, we elected to terminate the forward starting swaps that were scheduled to settle in September 2017, which resulted in cash gains totaling $6.1 million.  As cash flow hedges, gains on these derivative instruments will be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and be amortized to earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) over the life of the associated future debt obligations beginning in September 2017.

Commodity Hedging Activities

The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps.

At September 30, 2016, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory.  

The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts.

The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities. We achieve this objective by executing sales contracts for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative instruments and related contracts. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for plant thermal reduction, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts.

The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net gain of $28.5 million recognized in income from our commodity derivatives designated as fair value hedges includes $0.8 million of net gains attributable to hedge ineffectiveness.   The remaining $27.7 million of net gain recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to prompt-to-forward month price differentials that were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Net gains or losses due to ineffectiveness and from those amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were immaterial for all other periods presented.

The following   table provides quantitative information regarding our recurring Level 3 fair value measurements for commodity derivatives at September 30, 2016:

With respect to commodity derivatives, we believe forward commodity prices are the most significant unobservable inputs in determining our Level 3 recurring fair value measurements at September 30, 2016.  In general, changes in the price of the underlying commodity increases or decreases the fair value of a commodity derivative depending on whether the derivative was purchased or sold.  We generally expect changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments to be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of our hedged exposures.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment) are reviewed for impairment (i.e., subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements) when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The following table summarizes our non-cash impairment charges by segment during each of the periods indicated:

Impairment charges are primarily a component of  Operating costs and expenses  on our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations.

Other Fair Value Information

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash balances), accounts receivable, commercial paper notes and accounts payable approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature.  The estimated total fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations was $22.5 billion and $19.51 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The aggregate carrying value of these debt obligations was $20.85 billion and $20.87 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  These values are based on quoted market prices for such debt or debt of similar terms and maturities (Level 2), our credit standing and the credit standing of our counterparties.  Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.  The amounts reported for fixed-rate debt obligations exclude those amounts hedged using fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. See   Interest Rate Hedging Activities   within this Note 12 for additional information.    The carrying values of our variable-rate long-term debt obligations approximate their fair values since the associated interest rates are market-based.  We do not have any long-term investments in debt or equity securities recorded at fair value.

Relationship with EPCO and Affiliates

We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its privately held affiliates (including Enterprise GP, our general partner), which are not a part of our consolidated group of companies.  

At September 30, 2016, EPCO and its privately held affiliates (including Dan Duncan LLC and certain Duncan family trusts) beneficially owned the following limited partner interests in us:

Table of Contents 

ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Of the total number of units held by EPCO and its privately held affiliates, 118,000,000 have been pledged as security under the credit facilities of a privately held affiliate at September 30, 2016. These credit facilities contain customary and other events of default, including defaults by us and other affiliates of EPCO.  An event of default, followed by a foreclosure on the pledged collateral, could ultimately result in a change in ownership of these units and affect the market price of our common units.

We and Enterprise GP are both separate legal entities apart from each other and apart from EPCO and its other affiliates, with assets and liabilities that are also separate from those of EPCO and its other affiliates.  EPCO and its privately held affiliates depend on the cash distributions they receive from us and other investments to fund their other activities and to meet their debt obligations.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid EPCO and its privately held affiliates cash distributions totaling $793.6 million and $705.9 million, respectively.  Distributions paid during 2015 excluded 35,380,000 Designated Units (see Note 8).

In January 2016, privately held affiliates of EPCO purchased 3,830,256 common units from us under our ATM program, generating gross proceeds of $100 million.  In February 2016, privately held affiliates of EPCO reinvested $100 million through our DRIP, resulting in the issuance of an additional 4,481,504 of our common units. See Note 8 for additional information regarding our ATM program and DRIP.

We have no employees.  All of our operating functions and general and administrative support services are provided by employees of EPCO pursuant to the ASA or by other service providers. The following table presents our related party costs and expenses attributable to the ASA with EPCO for the periods indicated:

Note 14.  Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

As part of our normal business activities, we may be named as defendants in legal proceedings, including those arising from regulatory and environmental matters.  Although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to fully indemnify us against losses arising from future legal proceedings.  We will vigorously defend the partnership in litigation matters.

Management has regular quarterly litigation reviews, including updates from legal counsel, to assess the possible need for accounting recognition and disclosure of these contingencies.  We accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If a range of probable loss amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued.

We do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote.  For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the impact would be material to our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.  Based on a consideration of all relevant known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any currently pending litigation directed against us will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually at the claim level or in the aggregate.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our accruals for litigation contingencies were $5.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and were recorded in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of  Other current liabilities.   Our evaluation of litigation contingencies is based on the facts and circumstances of each case and predicting the outcome of these matters involves uncertainties.  In the event the assumptions we use to evaluate these matters change in future periods or new information becomes available, we may be required to record additional accruals.  In an effort to mitigate expenses associated with litigation, we may settle legal proceedings out of court.

ETP Matter 

In connection with a proposed pipeline project, we and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. ( ETP ) signed a non-binding letter of intent in April 2011 that disclaimed any partnership or joint venture related to such project absent executed definitive documents and board approvals of the respective companies.  Definitive agreements were never executed and board approval was never obtained for the potential pipeline project.  In August 2011, the proposed pipeline project was cancelled due to a lack of customer support.

In September 2011, ETP filed suit against us and a third party in connection with the cancelled project alleging, among other things, that we and ETP had formed a  partnership.   The case was tried in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, 298th Judicial District.  While we firmly believe, and argued during our defense, that no agreement was ever executed forming a legal joint venture or partnership between the parties, the jury found that the actions of the two companies, nevertheless, constituted a legal partnership.  As a result, the jury found that ETP was wrongfully excluded from a subsequent pipeline project involving a third party, and awarded ETP $319.4 million in actual damages on March 4, 2014.  On July 29, 2014, the court entered judgment against us in an aggregate amount of $535.8 million, which includes (i) $319.4 million as the amount of actual damages awarded by the jury, (ii) an additional $150.0 million in disgorgement for the alleged benefit we received due to a breach of fiduciary duties by us against ETP and (iii) prejudgment interest in the amount of $66.4 million.  The court also awarded post-judgment interest on such aggregate amount, to accrue at a rate of 5%, compounded annually.

We do not believe that the verdict or the judgment entered against us is supported by the evidence or the law.  We filed our Brief of the Appellant in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Dallas, Texas on March 30, 2015 and ETP filed its Brief of Appellees on June 29, 2015.  We filed our Reply Brief of Appellant on September 18, 2015.  Oral argument was conducted on April 20, 2016, and the case has now been submitted to the Court of Appeals for its consideration.  We intend to vigorously oppose the judgment through the appeals process.  As of September 30, 2016, we have not recorded a provision for this matter as management believes payment of damages in this case is not probable.

FTC Inquiry regarding Oiltanking Acquisition 

On February 23, 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand and a related Subpoena Duces Tecum from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) requesting specified information relating to the Oiltanking acquisition and our operations.  On April 13, 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand issued by the Attorney General of the State of Texas requesting copies of the same information and any correspondence with the FTC.  In a letter dated August 10, 2016 and published by the FTC on August 19, 2016, the FTC announced,  [u]pon further review of this matter, it now appears that no further action is warranted by the Commission at this time.  Accordingly, the investigation has been closed.   Contemporaneously, the Attorney General of the State of Texas closed its investigation of the Oiltanking acquisition.

PDH Litigation 

In July 2013, we executed a contract with Foster Wheeler USA Corporation ( Foster Wheeler ) pursuant to which Foster Wheeler was to serve as the general contractor responsible for the engineering, procurement, construction and installation of our propane dehydrogenation ( PDH ) facility.  In November 2014, Foster Wheeler was acquired by an affiliate of AMEC plc to form Amec Foster Wheeler plc, and Foster Wheeler is now known as Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation ( AFW ).  In December 2015, Enterprise and AFW entered into a transition services agreement under which AFW was partially terminated from the PDH project.  In December 2015, Enterprise engaged a second contractor, Optimized Process Designs LLC ( OPD ), to complete the construction and installation of the PDH facility.

On September 2, 2016, we terminated AFW for cause and filed a lawsuit in the 151st Judicial Civil District Court of Harris County, Texas against AFW and its parent company, Amec Foster Wheeler plc, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraudulent inducement, string-along fraud, gross negligence, professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation and attorneys  fees.  This case has yet to be set for trial, and we intend to diligently prosecute these claims and seek all direct, consequential, and exemplary damages to which we may be entitled.

Contractual Obligations

Scheduled Maturities of Debt 

We have long-term and short-term payment obligations under debt agreements.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding our scheduled future maturities of debt principal.

Operating Lease Obligations 

Consolidated lease and rental expense was $27.0 million and $28.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consolidated lease and rental expense was $81.8 million and $76.4 million, respectively.  Our operating lease commitments at September 30, 2016 did not differ materially from those reported in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Purchase Obligations 

Our consolidated purchase obligations at September 30, 2016 did not differ materially from those reported in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Option Agreement

We entered into a put option agreement (the  Liquidity Option Agreement ) with OTA and Marquard   Bahls ( M B ) in connection with the Oiltanking acquisition. Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, we granted M B the option to sell to us 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020. At that time, OTA s only significant asset is expected to be the 54,807,352 Enterprise common units it received in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, to the extent that such common units are not sold by M B prior to the option exercise date pursuant to a related registration rights agreement.

If the Liquidity Option is exercised, we would indirectly acquire any Enterprise common units owned by OTA and assume all future income tax obligations of OTA associated with (i) owning common units encumbered by the entity-level taxes of a U.S. corporation and (ii) OTA s deferred tax liabilities.  To the extent that the sum of OTA s deferred tax liabilities exceeds the then current book value of the Liquidity Option liability, we will recognize expense for the difference.

The fair value of the Liquidity Option, at any measurement date, represents the present value of estimated federal and state income tax payments that we believe a market participant would incur on the future taxable income of OTA.  We expect that OTA s taxable income would, in turn, be based on an allocation of our partnership s taxable income to the common units held by OTA and reflect any tax planning we believe could be employed.  Our valuation estimate for the Liquidity Option is based on several inputs that are not observable in the market (i.e., Level 3 inputs).  For example, the fair value of the Liquidity Option at September 30, 2016 was estimated at $273.1 million and was based on the following Level 3 inputs:

OTA remains in existence (i.e., is not dissolved and its assets sold) between one and 30 years following exercise of the Liquidity Option, depending on the liquidity preference of its owner. An equal probability that OTA will be dissolved was assigned to each year in the 30-year forecast period;

OTA assumes approximately $2.2 billion of associated long-term debt (30-year maturity) immediately after the Liquidity Option is exercised. For purposes of the valuation at September 30, 2016, we used a market rate commensurate with level of debt and tenure of approximately 4.75%.   If the assumption of debt is excluded from the valuation model (and all other inputs are the same), the estimated fair value of the Liquidity Option would increase by $211.1 million at September 30, 2016;

Forecasted annual growth rates of Enterprise s taxable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ranging from 2% to 15%;

41 

Table of Contents 

ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS PARTNERS L.P.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OTA s ownership interest in Enterprise common units is assumed to be diluted over time in connection with Enterprise s issuance of equity for general company reasons.  For purposes of the valuation at September 30, 2016, we used ownership interests ranging from 1.9% to 2.6%;

A forecasted yield on Enterprise common units of 5.8% to 6.6%;

OTA pays an aggregate federal and state income tax rate of 38% on its taxable income; and

Furthermore, our valuation estimate incorporates probability-weighted scenarios reflecting the likelihood that M B may elect to divest a portion of the Enterprise common units held by OTA prior to exercise of the option. At September 30, 2016, based on these scenarios, we expect that OTA would own approximately 83% of the 54,807,352 Enterprise common units it received in Step 1 when the option period begins in February 2020.  For sensitivity purposes, if OTA owned all of the Enterprise common units it received in Step 1 at the time of exercise (and all other inputs remained the same), the estimated fair value of the Liquidity Option liability would increase by $56.7 million at September 30, 2016.

Changes in the fair value of the Liquidity Option are recognized in earnings as a component of other income (expense) on our Unaudited Statements of Consolidated Operations.  Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include $4.3 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of expense for the Liquidity Option.  Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $6.9 million and $28.0 million, respectively, of aggregate non-cash expense attributable to accretion and changes in management estimates regarding inputs to the valuation model.

Note 15.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information

The following table presents the net effect of changes in our operating accounts for the periods indicated:

We incurred liabilities for construction in progress that had not been paid at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $166.5 million and $472.8 million, respectively.  Such amounts are not included under the caption  Capital expenditures  on the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures.  The majority of such arrangements are associated with projects related to pipeline construction activities and production well tie-ins.  These cash receipts are presented as  Contributions in aid of construction costs  within the investing activities section of our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Overview of Business

We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  EPD.   We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquid ( NGL ) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.  Our midstream energy operations currently include: natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage; NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and import and export terminals (including liquefied petroleum gas, or  LPG  crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and terminals; petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage and terminals, and related services; and a marine transportation business that operates primarily on the U.S. inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems.  Our assets currently include approximately 49,000 miles of pipelines; 250 MMBbls of storage capacity for NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products; and 14 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity.

We conduct substantially all of our business through EPO and are owned 100% by our limited partners from an economic perspective.  Enterprise GP manages our partnership and owns a non-economic general partner interest in us.  Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees.  All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement ( ASA ) or by other service providers.

Our historical operations are reported under five business segments:  (i) NGL Pipelines   Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, (iv) Petrochemical   Refined Products Services and (v) Offshore Pipelines   Services.  On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale of our Offshore Business, which primarily consisted of our Offshore Pipelines   Services segment.  Our consolidated financial statements reflect ownership of the Offshore Business through July 24, 2015.  See Note 9 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our business segments.

Significant Recent Developments

Completion of Ethane Export Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel

In September 2016, we placed our ethane export terminal located at Morgan s Point on the Houston Ship Channel (the  Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal ) into commercial service, and the terminal loaded its first vessel bound for Europe with 265,000 barrels of ethane.  The Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which is the largest of its kind in the world, has an aggregate loading rate (nameplate capacity) of approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane.  Supply for the Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal is sourced from our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex and transported through a new 18-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that we completed in February 2016.

The Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal supports growing international demand for abundant U.S. ethane from shale plays, which offers the global petrochemical industry a low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification.  By providing producers with access to the export market, the Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal is also facilitating continued development of U.S. energy reserves.

Start-Up of Delaware Basin Gas Processing Plant

In August 2016, construction of our joint venture-owned Delaware Basin cryogenic natural gas processing plant (referred to as the  Waha  plant) was completed, and the facility was placed into service.  The Waha plant, the construction of which is supported by long-term contracts, has a natural gas processing capacity of 150 MMcf/d and is able to extract in excess of 22 MBPD of NGLs.  The plant is located in Reeves County, Texas and was designed to accommodate the growing production of NGL-rich natural gas from the Delaware Basin.  We own a 50% equity interest in the joint venture that owns the Waha plant, which we operate.

In conjunction with the completion of the construction of the Waha plant, we completed construction of an 82-mile, 12-inch diameter pipeline that connects the Waha plant to our Chaparral Pipeline system, which transports mixed NGLs from natural gas processing plants in West Texas and New Mexico to our NGL fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Our Texas Intrastate System provides transportation services for natural gas processed at the Waha plant.

Addition of Propylene Export Capability at our Houston Ship Channel terminal

In July 2016, we initiated polymer grade propylene ( PGP ) loading services at our Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal ( EHT,  formerly known as our  Houston Ship Channel LPG export terminal ), which is located on the Houston Ship Channel.  We are expecting an increase in the number of PGP export cargoes in response to international demand.  We now have the capability to load 5,000 metric tons per day of refrigerated PGP at the EHT dock facilities, which are directly supplied by propylene fractionators and storage wells at our Mont Belvieu, Texas complex.

Final Payment for EFS Midstream Acquisition

In July 2015, we purchased EFS Midstream from affiliates of Pioneer and Reliance for approximately $2.1 billion, which was payable in two installments.  The initial payment of $1.1 billion was paid at closing on July 8, 2015.  The second and final installment of $1.0 billion was paid on July 11, 2016 using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO s commercial paper program.

Fire at Pascagoula Facility

In late June 2016, we experienced a fire at our Pascagoula natural gas processing plant located in Pascagoula, Mississippi (the  Pascagoula Facility ).  This facility processes natural gas received from third-party production developments located in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  We own and operate the Pascagoula Facility, which remains out of service as a result of damage sustained during the fire.  Repairs to this location have commenced and the facility is expected to return to commercial service during the fourth quarter of 2016.

As a result of this event, we recorded a $7.1 million non-cash loss in the second quarter of 2016 attributable to assets damaged in the fire. In addition, we incurred $7.1 million of expense during the third quarter of 2016 for fire response activities at the Pascagoula Facility. We will capitalize those expenditures we incur to rebuild the facility.

Under our current insurance program, the standalone deductible for property damage claims is $55 million.  We also have business interruption protection; however, such claims must involve physical damage and have a combined loss value in excess of $55 million and the period of interruption must exceed 60 days.  We continue to evaluate the possibility of filing an insurance claim related to this event.

Expansion of Delaware Basin Network with New Natural Gas Processing Plant

In June 2016, we announced plans to build a second new cryogenic natural gas processing facility and associated natural gas and NGL pipeline infrastructure to facilitate continued growth of NGL-rich natural gas production in the Delaware Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.  The site for the new processing plant, which will have a nameplate capacity of 300 MMcf/d and the capability to extract more than 40,000 barrels per day of NGL, has yet to be determined.  The project is anchored by long-term commitments from a major producer.  The facility, which we will own and operate, is expected to begin service in the second quarter of 2018.

In addition to providing new gas processing capabilities, the scope of the project will include construction of natural gas gathering lines, a pipeline to deliver residue natural gas to markets at the Waha hub, and an NGL pipeline to our Mid-America Pipeline System.  These assets will be designed to integrate with the rest of our Delaware Basin infrastructure.

Start-Up of South Eddy Natural Gas Processing Plant

In May 2016, we announced that our new cryogenic natural gas processing plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico (the  South Eddy  plant) had been placed into service.  We constructed the South Eddy plant to serve producers in the Delaware Basin region.  The South Eddy plant has a nameplate natural gas processing capacity of 200 MMcf/d and is capable of extracting up to 25 MBPD of NGLs.  We also completed construction of approximately 90 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines to supply the new plant.

In addition to the South Eddy plant and its related natural gas gathering infrastructure, we also completed a 71-mile extension of our Mid-America Pipeline System.  This extension provides producers in the Delaware Basin with NGL takeaway capacity and direct access to our integrated network of NGL assets.

Selected Energy Commodity Price Data

The following table presents index prices for natural gas, crude oil and selected NGL and petrochemical products for the periods indicated:

Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices.  Energy commodity prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand imbalances and geopolitical tensions.  Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been depressed since the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to an oversupply of these commodities on world markets.  The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.49 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016 versus $0.45 per gallon during the third quarter of 2015.  Likewise, the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.46 per gallon during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.50 per gallon during the same period in 2015.

A decrease in our consolidated marketing revenues due to lower energy commodity sales prices may not result in a decrease in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be lower due to comparable decreases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities.  The same correlation would be true in the case of higher energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.

We attempt to mitigate any commodity price exposure through our hedging activities as well as through converting keepwhole and similar contracts to fee-based arrangements.  See Note 12 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities.

Consolidated Income Statement Highlights

The following information highlights significant changes in our comparative income statement amounts and the primary drivers of such changes.

Revenues 

Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to Third Quarter of 2015.  Total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $387.5 million when compared to total revenues for the third quarter of 2015.  Revenues from the marketing of crude oil decreased $609.2 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for $529.6 million and $79.6 million of the decrease, respectively.  Revenues from the marketing of octane additives decreased $36.1 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower sales prices.  Revenues from the marketing of NGLs and refined products increased a net $203.0 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $270.9 million increase, partially offset by lower sales prices, which accounted for a $67.9 million decrease.  Revenues from the marketing of natural gas and petrochemicals increased $67.7 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to higher sales volumes and prices, which accounted for $41.3 million and $26.4 million of the increase, respectively.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues decreased $4.33 billion when compared to total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Revenues from the marketing of crude oil and natural gas decreased $3.81 billion period-to-period primarily due to lower sales volumes and prices, which accounted for a $2.02 billion decrease and a $1.79 billion decrease, respectively.  Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $558.8 million period-to-period primarily due to lower sales prices, which accounted for a $1.39 billion decrease, partially offset by an $829.6 million increase due to higher sales volumes.

Revenues from midstream services increased a net $77.7 million period-to-period primarily due to contributions from EFS Midstream, which were partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of our Offshore Business.  Revenues increased $140.0 million period-to-period from the assets we acquired in the EFS Midstream acquisition in July 2015.  Revenues from midstream services decreased $76.0 million period-to-period due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015.

Operating costs and expenses 

Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to Third Quarter of 2015.   Total operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $386.9 million when compared to total operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2015.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $575.6 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and purchase prices, which accounted for $467.9 million and $107.7 million of the decrease, respectively.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of natural gas and octane additives decreased a net $17.4 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $48.6 million decrease, partially offset by higher sales volumes, which accounted for a $31.2 million increase.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs and petrochemicals increased $176.6 million due to higher sales volumes and prices, which accounted for $133.0 million and $43.6 million of the increase, respectively.

Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $30.4 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower maintenance expenses during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2016 increased $16.0 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service since the third quarter of 2015.

58 

Table of Contents 

Operating costs and expenses also include $6.8 million and $26.8 million of non-cash asset impairment charges for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our asset impairment charges for the third quarter of 2016 primarily relate to the planned abandonment of pipeline and storage assets in Texas.  Our non-cash asset impairment charges for the third quarter of 2015 primarily relate to the planned abandonment of natural gas processing assets in southern Louisiana and the reclassification of certain marine vessels to held for sale status.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total operating costs and expenses decreased $4.39 billion when compared to the same period in 2015.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of crude oil decreased $3.33 billion period-to-period primarily due to lower sales volumes, which accounted for a $1.84 billion decrease, and lower purchase prices, which accounted for an additional $1.49 billion decrease.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs, natural gas, petrochemicals, refined products and octane additives decreased a net $886.9 million period-to-period primarily due to lower purchase prices, which accounted for a $1.57 billion decrease, partially offset by a $680.3 million increase due to higher sales volumes.

Other operating costs and expenses decreased a net $47.6 million period-to-period primarily due to lower maintenance expenses during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses increased a net $3.6 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  An $84.3 million decrease attributable to the sale of our Offshore Business was more than offset by an $87.9 million period-to-period increase primarily due to assets we constructed and placed into service or acquired since the second quarter of 2015.

Operating costs and expenses also include $21.6 million and $139.1 million of non-cash asset impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We recorded a $54.8 million asset impairment charge in the second quarter of 2015 in connection with our sale of the Offshore Business.  The remainder of our asset impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain crude oil and natural gas pipeline assets in Texas.

General and administrative costs 

General and administrative costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $7.0 million and $22.2 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily  due to lower costs for employee compensation and professional services.

Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 

Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for the third quarter of 2016 decreased a net $10.8 million when compared to third quarter of 2015.  Results for the third quarter of 2015 included $5.4 million of equity earnings attributable to our former Offshore Business, which we sold in July 2015.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates decreased a net $32.7 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflect $46.6 million of equity earnings attributable to the Offshore Business sold in July 2015.  This period-to-period decrease was partially offset by a $13.8 million increase in earnings from our investments in crude oil pipelines, which benefited from the settlement of a rate case by the Seaway Crude Pipeline Company ( Seaway ) during the first quarter of 2016.

(1)     We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) ratably over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital spending levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings. 

(2)     Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs. 

Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is the primary driver of interest expense, increased a net $3.2 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during the third quarter of 2016, which accounted for a $16.1 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates during the third quarter of 2016, which accounted for a $12.9 million decrease.  Our weighted-average debt principal balance for the third quarter of 2016 was $23.69 billion compared to $22.45 billion for the third quarter of 2015.  In general, our debt principal balances have increased over time due to the partial debt financing of our capital spending program.  For a discussion of our consolidated debt obligations and capital spending program, see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  and  Capital Spending  within this Part I, Item 2.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest charged on debt principal outstanding increased a net $22.1 million period-to-period primarily due to increased debt principal amounts outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which accounted for a $39.0 million increase, partially offset by the effect of lower overall interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which accounted for a $16.9 million decrease.  Our weighted-average debt principal balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $23.23 billion compared to $22.08 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Change in fair value of Liquidity Option Agreement 

Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $6.9 million and $28.0 million, respectively, of aggregate non-cash expense attributable to accretion and changes in management estimates regarding inputs to the valuation model for the Liquidity Option Agreement.   For information regarding the Liquidity Option Agreement, see Note 14 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed  Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 

Income taxes 

Income taxes primarily reflects our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax.  Our provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $0.7 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our provision for income taxes increased $8.7 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a benefit we recorded in 2015 related to lower tax rates enacted by the State of Texas in June 2015.

Business Segment Highlights

We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and non-GAAP total gross operating margin for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):

Gross operating margin by segment for NGL Pipelines   Services and Crude Oil Pipelines   Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management s evaluation of segment results.  However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin in compliance with recently issued guidance from the SEC.  The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income.  See  Other Items   Non-GAAP Reconciliations  within this Part I, Item 2 for reconciliations of gross operating margin to operating income for each period presented.

Each of our business segments benefit from the supporting role of our marketing activities.  The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment.  In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for the partnership.  The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.

The following information highlights significant changes in our quarterly and year-to-date segment results (i.e., our gross operating margin by segment amounts) and the primary drivers of such changes.  The volume statistics presented in the tabular information for each segment are reported on a net basis, taking into account our ownership interests in certain joint ventures, and reflect the periods in which we owned an interest in such operations.  These statistics reflect volumes for newly constructed assets from the dates such assets were placed into service.

Gross operating margin from NGL fractionation increased $3.4 million period-to-period primarily due to higher fractionation volumes of 7 MBPD at our Mont Belvieu complex for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Crude Oil Pipelines   Services 

The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Crude Oil Pipelines   Services segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted):

Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to Third Quarter of 2015.  Gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines   Services segment decreased a net $0.6 million quarter-to-quarter primarily from variances attributable to our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System, crude oil marketing and related trucking activities, EFS Midstream assets and crude oil terminaling services.

Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $22.1 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower average fees, which accounted for a $12.3 million decrease, and lower transportation volumes of 60 MBPD, which accounted for a $12.5 million decrease.  Equity earnings from our investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Pipeline joint venture decreased $5.9 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower transportation volumes of 38 MBPD (net to our interest). The decrease in crude oil transportation volumes on these systems is attributable to reduced producer drilling activity across the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related trucking activities decreased a net $5.7 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower crude oil sales margins, which accounted for a $28.8 million decrease, partially offset by $23.2 million of non-cash mark-to-market gains recorded in the third quarter of 2016 on financial instruments related to blending activities.

Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream system increased $14.5 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to higher revenues, which accounted for a net $9.1 million increase, and a $5.4 million decrease in operating costs.  Condensate volumes on our EFS Midstream system decreased 25 MBPD quarter-to-quarter reflecting reduced drilling activity in the region of the Eagle Ford Shale served by this system.

Gross operating margin from crude oil terminaling services at our Beaumont Marine West ( BMW ) and Enterprise Crude Houston ( ECHO ) and EHT facilities increased a combined $12.7 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to expansion projects at these facilities (e.g., the construction of new storage tanks).

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross operating margin from our Crude Oil Pipelines   Services segment decreased $70.5 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Gross operating margin from our crude oil marketing and related trucking activities decreased $158.9 million period-to-period primarily due to lower crude oil sales margins, which accounted for a $121.4 million decrease, and $37.5 million of net non-cash mark-to-market losses recorded in 2016 on financial instruments related to blending activities.  As a result of lower crude oil prices, regional price spreads have been less than the costs incurred by our marketing business. This impact is more pronounced given that our crude oil marketing business has contracted for 75 MBPD of firm capacity on the Seaway Pipeline, of which 25 MBPD of capacity terminates June 1, 2017 and the remaining 50 MBPD terminates February 1, 2018.  Sales margins on Seaway Pipeline-related capacity were $33.4 million lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.

Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased $68.7 million period-to-period primarily due to a 67 MBPD decrease in volumes, which accounted for a $46.2 million decrease, and a $21.2 million decrease due to lower average transportation fees.  As noted previously, the decrease in crude oil transportation volumes is attributable to reduced producer drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale.  Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream system, which we acquired effective July 1, 2015, increased $123.3 million period-to-period due to the timing of the acquisition of these assets.   Gross operating margin for this system reflects nine months of ownership in 2016 versus three months in 2015.

Gross operating margin from crude oil terminaling services at our BMW and ECHO facilities increased a combined $29.0 million period-to-period primarily due to expansion projects.

Equity earnings from our investment in Seaway increased $16.2 million period-to-period primarily due to the settlement of a rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) in the first quarter of 2016.  In February 2016, the FERC issued its decision regarding the various challenges to Seaway s committed and uncommitted rates in FERC Docket No. IS12-226-000.  The FERC upheld the committed rates and rejected the claim that the committed rates should be reduced to cost-based levels. The FERC s rulings regarding the uncommitted rates were also largely favorable to Seaway.  Seaway submitted a compliance filing in March 2016 calculating revised uncommitted rates consistent with the FERC s order. The compliance filing was not challenged and the FERC accepted the revised rates.  On a 100% basis, Seaway recorded a $24.5 million benefit related to settlement of the rate case, with our 50% share of the benefit equating to $12.3 million.  Transportation volumes on the Seaway Pipeline decreased 21 MBPD period-to-period (net to our interest).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this quarterly report), we believe we will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future.  At September 30, 2016, we had $3.52 billion of consolidated liquidity, which was comprised of $3.46 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO s revolving credit facilities and $57.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand.

We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including those related to capital spending.

At September 30, 2016, the aggregate carrying value of our product inventories was $1.76 billion compared to $1.04 billion at December 31, 2015.  Our inventories, and associated working capital commitments, have increased significantly since December 31, 2015 primarily due to our marketing groups taking advantage of contango opportunities using our storage assets.  We expect to gradually settle these inventory positions (valued at approximately $1 billion) through the first quarter of 2017, with a corresponding decrease in working capital commitments and related debt.   For additional information regarding our inventories, see Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Table of Contents 

Net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used as follows: (i) the repayment of amounts then outstanding under EPO s commercial paper program, which included amounts we used to repay $750 million in principal amount of Senior Notes AA that matured in February 2016, and (ii) for general company purposes.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has unconditionally guaranteed these senior notes on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.  These senior notes rank equal with EPO s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO.  These senior notes are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants, which generally restrict EPO s ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions.

Renewal of 364-Day Credit Agreement 

In September 2016, EPO amended its 364-Day Credit Agreement to extend its maturity date to September 2017.  There are currently no principal amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.  Under the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion (which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable interest rate for a term of 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.  To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as a non-revolving term loan for a period of one additional year, payable in September 2018.  The remaining terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, as amended, remain materially the same as those reported for the 364-Day Credit Agreement in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Issuance of Common Units

The following table summarizes the issuance of common units in connection with our underwritten equity offerings, at-the-market ( ATM ) program, distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP ) and employee unit purchase plan ( EUPP ) for the quarterly periods indicated (dollars in millions, number of units issued as shown):

Privately held affiliates of EPCO invested an aggregate $200 million in us through our ATM program and the DRIP during the first quarter of 2016 (this amount being a component of the net cash proceeds presented in the preceding table).

Universal shelf registration statement 

On May 12, 2016, we filed with the SEC a new universal shelf registration statement (the  2016 Shelf ), which was immediately effective and replaced our prior universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2013 (the  2013 Shelf ).  The 2016 Shelf allows (and the prior 2013 Shelf allowed) Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and EPO (each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively.

At-the-Market program 

On July 11, 2016, we filed an amended registration statement with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $1.89 billion of our common units in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings.  Pursuant to the ATM program, we may sell common units under an equity distribution agreement between Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and certain broker-dealers from time-to-time by means of ordinary brokers  transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to with the broker-dealer parties to the agreement.  The new registration statement was declared effective on July 14, 2016 and replaced our prior registration statement with respect to the ATM program. Following the effectiveness of the new ATM registration statement and after taking into account the aggregate sales price of common units sold under the ATM program through September 30, 2016, we have the capacity to issue additional common units under the ATM program up to an aggregate sales price of $1.75 billion.

Distribution reinvestment plan 

On May 12, 2016, we filed with the SEC a new registration statement in connection with our DRIP, which was immediately effective and amended a prior registration statement filed in March 2010.  The new registration statement increased the aggregate number of our common units authorized for issuance under the DRIP from 140,000,000 to 240,000,000.  The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional new common units.  After taking into account the new registration statement and the number of common units issued under the DRIP through September 30, 2016, we have the capacity to issue an additional 102,121,274 common units under this plan.

For additional information regarding our issuance of common units and related registration statements, see Note 8 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products.  Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices fluctuate or margin requirements change.  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our restricted cash amounts were $277.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively.  The balance at September 30, 2016 consisted of initial margin requirements of $48.9 million and variation margin requirements of $228.4 million. The initial margin requirements will be returned to us as the related derivative instruments are settled.  Our variation margin requirements increased by $248.7 million since December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher forward commodity prices for NGLs and related hydrocarbons during 2016 relative to our short financial derivative positions in these products.  For information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 12 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Credit Ratings

As of November 1, 2016, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from Standard and Poor s and Baa1 from Moody s.  In addition, the credit ratings of EPO s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor s and P-2 from Moody s.  Fitch Ratings issued non-solicited ratings of BBB+ and F-2 for EPO s long-term senior unsecured debt securities and short-term senior unsecured debt securities, respectively.

EPO s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities.  A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change.  A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies.

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities

The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (dollars in millions).  For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities.  We operate in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.  As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services.  In addition, decreases in demand may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels.  We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent counterparties do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural gas, NGLs, propylene, refined products and/or crude oil and long-term take-or-pay agreements.  For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see  Risk Factors  under Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Form 10-K and under Part II, Item 1A of this quarterly report.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

The following information highlights significant period-to-period fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:

Operating Activities.   Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $67.8 million when compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to:

a $138.2 million period-to-period increase in cash primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to operations; and

a $10.4 million increase in cash attributable to higher partnership income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (after adjusting our $18.4 million period-to-period increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); partially offset by

an $80.8 million period-to-period decrease in cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015.

For information regarding significant period-to-period changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see  Results of Operations  within this Part I, Item 2.

Investing Activities.   Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.39 billion when compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to:

a $1.49 billion period-to-period decrease in proceeds from asset sales primarily due to the sale of our Offshore Business in July 2015, which generated $1.53 billion; and

a $215.2 million period-to-period increase in restricted cash requirements; partially offset by

72 

Table of Contents 

a $209.3 million period-to-period decrease in capital spending for consolidated property, plant and equipment, net of contributions in aid of construction costs;

$51.9 million of distributions received in connection with the return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates during 2016;

a $45.1 million period-to-period decrease in cash used for business combinations; and

a $10.8 million period-to-period decrease in investments in our unconsolidated affiliates.

Financing Activities.   Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.07 billion compared to cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $276.9 million.  The $1.35 billion period-to-period change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to:

a $1.16 billion period-to-period increase in net cash proceeds from the issuance of common units.  We issued an aggregate 89,448,050 common units in connection with our ATM program, DRIP and EUPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which generated $2.17 billion of net cash proceeds.  This compares to an aggregate 31,509,768 common units we issued in connection with these programs and plans during the same period in 2015, which collectively generated $1.01 billion of net cash proceeds; and

a $432.8 million period-to-period increase in net borrowings under our consolidated debt agreements.  EPO issued $1.25 billion and repaid $750.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the issuance of $2.5 billion and repayment of $1.48 billion in principal amount of senior and junior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net issuances under EPO s commercial paper program were $913.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net repayments of $40.8 million during the same period in 2015; partially offset by

a $263.2 million period-to-period increase in cash distributions paid to limited partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase in cash distributions is due to increases in both the number of distribution-bearing common units outstanding and the quarterly cash distribution rates per unit.

Cash Distributions to Limited Partners

Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion.  Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business including, for example, those for capital expenditures, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, commitments and contingencies and other significant amounts.  The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.

Based on the level of available cash, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board of Enterprise GP, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Unlike most master limited partnerships, our general partner has a non-economic ownership interest in us and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from us based on IDRs or other equity interests.

Designated Units Issued in Connection with Holdings Merger 

In November 2010, we completed our merger with Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (the  Holdings Merger ).  In connection with the Holdings Merger, a privately held affiliate of EPCO agreed to temporarily waive the regular cash distributions it would otherwise receive from us with respect to a certain number of our common units it owns (the  Designated Units ).  Distributions paid by us to this privately held affiliate of EPCO during 2015 excluded 35,380,000 Designated Units.  The temporary distribution waiver expired in November 2015; therefore, distributions paid to partners during calendar year 2016 are payable on all outstanding common units.

Capital Spending

An important part of our business strategy involves expansion through growth capital projects, business combinations and investments in joint ventures.  We believe that we are positioned to continue to expand our network of assets through the construction of new facilities and to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production resulting from development activities in the  Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Northeast and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, including the Niobrara, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica Shale plays.   Although our focus in recent years has been on expansion through growth capital projects, management continues to analyze potential business combinations, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions.  In light of current business conditions, we expect that these opportunities will increase.

We began commercial service on approximately $2.1 billion of growth capital projects during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These projects included our Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal, Waha and South Eddy natural gas processing facilities and the completion of over 2 MMBbls of additional crude oil storage capacity at our terminals in Houston and Beaumont.  We expect to place another $400 million of projects into commercial service during the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, we have approximately $5.2 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed in 2017 and 2018 including our PDH facility, Midland-to-Sealy Pipeline and completion of joint venture-owned dock infrastructure in Corpus Christi designed to accommodate crude oil volumes.

We expect our organic growth capital expenditures for calendar year 2016 to approximate $2.8 billion and sustaining capital expenditures to approximate $250 million. These amounts exclude the $1.0 billion final installment for EFS Midstream paid in July 2016. Our forecast of capital spending for 2016 is based on our announced strategic operating and growth plans (through the filing date of this quarterly report), which are dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures.  We may revise our forecast of capital spending due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather related issues and changes in supplier prices.  Furthermore, our forecast of capital spending may change as a result of decisions made by management at a later date, which may include unforeseen acquisition opportunities.

Our success in raising capital, including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks, continues to be a significant factor in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we expect to make the forecasted capital expenditures noted above, we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures in response to changes in capital market conditions.

(3)     On certain of our capital projects, third parties are obligated to reimburse us for all or a portion of project expenditures. The majority of such arrangements are associated with pipeline construction projects and production well tie-ins. Contributions in aid of construction costs were $34.1 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis and net of related contributions in aid of construction costs. 

(4)     Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows. 

(5)     Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. 

Fluctuations in our spending for growth capital projects and investments in unconsolidated affiliates are explained in large part by increases or decreases in spending on major expansion projects.  Our most significant growth capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 involved projects at our Mont Belvieu complex.  Fluctuations in spending for sustaining capital projects are explained in large part by the timing and cost of pipeline integrity and similar projects.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

We acquired EFS Midstream in July 2015 for approximately $2.1 billion in cash payable in two installments.  The initial installment of approximately $1.1 billion was paid in July 2015, with the final $1.0 billion payment made in July 2016.

In total, capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased $209.3 million period-to-period primarily due to lower growth capital spending during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Growth capital spending at our EHT and ethane export facilities decreased a combined $195.7 million period-to-period.  We completed two expansion projects during 2015 at our EHT facility that increased our ability to load cargos of fully refrigerated, low-ethane propane to approximately 16.0 MMBbls per month.  In September 2016, we placed our Morgan s Point Ethane Export Terminal into service.  Likewise, growth capital spending on our ethane header system between Corpus Christi, Texas and the Mississippi River in Louisiana decreased $187.7 million period-to-period.  We completed the Aegis Ethane Pipeline (i.e., a component of our ethane header system) in December 2015.

Growth capital spending at our Mont Belvieu complex increased $129.2 million period-to-period primarily due to ongoing construction of our PDH facility.  Currently, we expect construction of the PDH facility to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 with commercial operations expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017.  Growth capital spending on our natural gas processing and related pipeline projects in the Delaware Basin increased a combined $38.0 million period-to-period.  Our South Eddy natural gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure began operations in May 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  The following types of estimates, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of professional judgment and involve complex analysis:

depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment;

measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and equity method investments;

amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets;

methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill; and

revenue recognition policies and the use of estimates for revenue and expenses.

When used to prepare our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the foregoing types of estimates are based on our current knowledge and understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances.  Such estimates may be revised as a result of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances.  Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other Items

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Total gross operating margin 

We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin.  Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 

As presented within Part I, Item 2 of this quarterly report, the term  total gross operating margin  represents GAAP operating income exclusive of (i) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, (ii) impairment charges, (iii) gains and losses attributable to asset sales, insurance recoveries and related property damage and (iv) general and administrative costs.  Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges.  Total gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests.  The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income.

Distributable cash flow 

Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners.  Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio.  Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP liquidity measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment.  Specifically, this liquidity measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions.  Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder.  The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

General

In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.  In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics.  Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities.

Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since those reported under Part II, Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  included in our 2015 Form 10-K.

We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model.  This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day.  In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding and the discount rates used to determine the present values.  The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate.  Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming:

the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk;

the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and

the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period.

We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions.  Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed.

See Note 12 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Commodity Hedging Activities

The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps.  The following table summarizes our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016 (volume measures as noted):

(2)     The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is December 2017, June 2017 and March 2020, respectively. 

(3)     Current and long-term volumes include 24.5 Bcf and 1.8 Bcf, respectively, of physical derivative instruments that are predominantly priced at a marked-based index plus a premium or minus a discount related to location differences. 

(4)     Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with transportation, processing and storage assets. 

At September 30, 2016, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory.  

The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts.

The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities.  We achieve this objective by executing sales contracts for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative instruments and related contracts.  For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production also involves the purchase of natural gas for plant thermal reduction, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts.

Interest Rate Hedging Activities

We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements.  This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings.  The composition of our derivative instrument portfolios may change depending on our hedging requirements.

With respect to the tabular data below, each portfolio s estimated fair value at a given date is based on a number of factors, including the number and types of derivatives outstanding at that date, the notional value of the swaps and associated interest rates.

Interest rate swaps exchange the stated interest rate paid on a notional amount of existing debt for the fixed or floating interest rate stipulated in the derivative instrument.  The following table summarizes our portfolio of interest rate swaps at September 30, 2016 (dollars in millions):

As a result of market conditions in October 2016, we elected to terminate the forward starting swaps that were scheduled to settle in September 2017, which resulted in cash gains totaling $6.1 million.  As cash flow hedges, gains on these derivative instruments will be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and be amortized to earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) over the life of the associated future debt obligations beginning in September 2017.

  Controls and Procedures .

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of (i) A. James Teague, our general partner s Chief Executive Officer, (ii) W. Randall Fowler, our general partner s President, and (iii) Bryan F. Bulawa, our general partner s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Mr. Teague is our principal executive officer and Messrs. Fowler and Bulawa represent our principal financial officers.  Based on this evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, Messrs. Teague, Fowler and Bulawa concluded:

(i) 
 
 that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures; and

(ii) 
 
 that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the third quarter of 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Section 302 and 906 Certifications

The required certifications of Messrs. Teague, Fowler and Bulawa under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are included as exhibits to this quarterly report (see Exhibits 31 and 32 under Part II, Item 6 of this quarterly report).

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  
 
  Legal Proceedings .

As part of our normal business activities, we may be named as defendants in litigation and legal proceedings, including those arising from regulatory and environmental matters.  Although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to indemnify us against liabilities arising from future legal proceedings.  We will vigorously defend the partnership in litigation matters.

For additional information regarding our litigation matters, see  Litigation  under Note 14 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report, which subsection is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1.

On occasion, we are assessed monetary sanctions by governmental authorities related to administrative or judicial proceedings involving environmental matters.  We do not expect such expenditures to be material to our consolidated financial statements .  In September 2016, we received a Notice of Violation from the New Mexico Environment Department in connection with air emissions at our Chaparral natural gas processing facility.  The  eventual resolution of these matters may result in monetary sanctions in excess of $0.1 million. 

Item 1A.       Risk Factors . 

An investment in our securities involves certain risks. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risks described under  Risk Factors  set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Form 10-K, in addition to other information in such annual report.  The risk factors set forth in our 2015 Form 10-K are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.

Disclosure Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, issuers are required to include certain disclosures in their periodic reports if they or any of their  affiliates  (as defined in Rule 12b-2 thereunder) have knowingly engaged in certain specified activities relating to Iran.  Disclosure is required even where the activities are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and even if the activities are not covered or prohibited by U.S. law.

Dr. F. Christian Flach was named a director of our general partner in October 2014 in connection with the acquisition of Oiltanking. Dr. Flach is also a managing director of Oiltanking GmbH, which maintains a joint venture interest in Oiltanking Odfjell GmbH, which in turn owns a joint venture interest in the Exir Chemical Terminal ( ECT ) in Iran.  This interest results from an investment dating back to 2002.  Oiltanking GmbH currently has the contractual right to vote for the appointment of one member of ECT s three-member board. Oiltanking GmbH provides no goods, services, technology, information or support to ECT and plays no role in the management or day-to-day operations of ECT.

Among other activities, ECT provides transit storage for naphtha originating in Iraq en route to Oman for a customer in the United Arab Emirates. ECT does not import or handle any products originated from Iran that are regulated under U.S., European Union or United Nations sanctions laws. ECT pays routine and standard charges (i) to the Petrochemical Special Economic Zone Organization ( Petzone ) for the use of pipelines and (ii) to Terminals and Tanks Petrochemical Co. ( TTPC ), which operates the berth.  Petzone and TTPC are subsidiaries of the National Petrochemical Company, which is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran.  As Oiltanking GmbH has no direct involvement in the day-to-day operations of ECT, we have no information regarding ECT s intent to continue or not continue making the payments described above.

Oiltanking GmbH maintains an internal compliance program to ensure compliance with all applicable sanctions regimes, including sanctions laws maintained by the U.S., European Union and United Nations.  Although the existence of the routine payments described above may be reportable under Section 13(r), Oiltanking GmbH has informed us that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, has engaged in any conduct that would be sanctionable under any of these legal regimes.
