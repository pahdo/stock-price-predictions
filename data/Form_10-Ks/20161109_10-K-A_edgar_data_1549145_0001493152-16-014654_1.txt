Background    

Business
Overview   

Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the  Company ) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy,
biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group
Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution
and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC ( AMG Renewables ), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group,
LLC ( AMG Energy ), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC ( Carbolosic ), which
holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal in acquiring
the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective
licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on the Company s
renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries.
The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company s entertainment-related assets were generating
substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and
to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest
and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined
that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective
December 5, 2014, amended the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy
Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company.  

The
Company is focused on one industry   Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AMG Renewables, LLC and Carbolosic
Plant 1, LLC, which in turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and Ek Laboratories, Inc., the Company has a
strategy that includes growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions and start-up activities which
are focused on development of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value.  

AMG
RENEWABLES, LLC   

AMG
Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables
has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Carbolosic Plant 1 ),
and two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Energy ) and
Ek Laboratories, Inc, a Florida corporation ( EK ) formerly known as Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology,
Inc.  

On
    December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties
    for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with
    the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated
    in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions,
    Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington
    Asset Holdings, Inc. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of this
    transaction, and as of such date, the Company has not paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the books
    of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition.   

AMG
    Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Carbolosic ),
    which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
    known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
    into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal is to develop
    this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees.   

On
    May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed
    the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which will be renamed Carbolosic Energy SA PTY
    LTD ( Carbolosic SA ). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South Africa,
    Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through July 1,
    2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 ( License Fee ), which must be paid or
    guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty of 3.5% of
    the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed. Until the
    $25,000,000 payment has been received, the Company does not consider all of the events required under the agreement to have
    been completed. Therefore the Company has not recorded any of the license fee in the accompanying financial statements.   

Contemporaneously,
    Carbolosic SA s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of
    Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company ( Tes ), 24.5 % for Spearhead
    Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company ( Spearhead ), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust ( Jupiter )
    and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of
    Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead s
    interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company s interest is in exchange for
    the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed
    in the United States.   

In
    February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust
    resigned from management and from the Board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic
    SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but at this time there is no guarantee that
    they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa
    in the coming months and decide on a path forward.    

Carbolosic
    Plant 1 was created in October 2014 for the purpose of being a full scale facility for converting cellulose material into
    sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing located in Palm Beach County, FL. In March
    2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction of
    the outstanding $1,250,000 loan. In addition, Company subsidiary AMG Energy Group issued a Sub-License to Carbolosic Plant
    1 for the use of the patented CTS technology in one (1) plant to be located in the U.S., under the terms and conditions of
    the master license agreement between Company affiliate Carbolosic, LLC and the University of Central Florida. The sub-license
    has a royalty payment of three percent (3%) of gross sales and twenty percent (20%) of the net profits of Carbolosic Plant
    1 payable to AMG Energy Group and is awaiting final approval from the University of Central Florida as is required under the
    master license agreement.    

EK,
    was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name
    to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration
    and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies.    

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical
manufacturing industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.

ITEM
3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

The
Company is subject, from time to time, to litigation, claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date
of filing, the only material litigation, claims or suits whose outcomes could have a material effect on the Company s financial
statements are as follows:  

Creative
Licensing Litigation .   

During
2013, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, AMG Television, LLC ( AMG Television ), had entered into agreements
(collectively, the  Creative Licensing Agreement ) to acquire (i) the partially completed American Idol style reality
series World Star (formerly Recreating A Legend) for a $600,000 cash payment plus 1,600,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) the completed documentary Making of a Saint: The Journey to Sainthood for a $100,000 cash payment plus 267,000 shares of
Company Common Stock. Subsequently, on April 25, 2014, the Company and AMG Television notified the sellers that it was rescinding
both transactions due to a breach of the Creative Licensing Agreement in that the sellers misled AMG Television regarding the
status and ownership of the rights and failed to provide agreed documentation required in order to permit exploitation of the
projects. In the legal action filed in the Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County Florida (Alliance Media
Group Holdings, Inc. and AMG Television, LLC v. Creative Licensing International, LLC, et. al. case no. 502014CA005033XXXXMBAF),
the Company and AMG Television allege that Creative Licensing International, LLC and 28 individual defendants (including Roy A.
Sciacca and Lisa Colletti) breached the Creative Licensing Agreement and fraudulently induced AMG Television to enter into the
Creative Licensing Agreement. The Company and AMG Television amended their complaint in the matter on May 14, 2014. The Company
and AMG Television are seeking the rescission of the Creative Licensing Agreement, return of the Company stock issued and cash
delivered in connection therewith and other and further damages suffered by the Company in an amount to be determined at the time
of trial. As of December 31, 2014, The Company and AMG Television had reached settlements (the  Settlement ) with
seven of the twenty-eight named defendants and the Company had canceled a net of 116,872 shares of common stock which have been
tendered to the Company. In February 2015, the Company reached a settlement of the case with respect to the principal defendants,
Roy A. Sciacca and Lisa Colletti whereby Sciacca and Colletti agreed to return an aggregate of 960,215 shares of previously issued
stock to the Company and the Company agreed to issue 500,000 new shares of stock to them. In connection with the Settlement with
Sciacca and Colletti, the Company has recovered a net of 497,555 shares issued in connection with the Creative Licensing transaction.
In the aggregate, the Company has now recovered 614,424 of the 1.867 million shares issued in connection with the transaction.
In addition, in connection with the Settlement, the Company recovered an additional 500,000 of the 800,000 shares of Company stock
which had been previously issued in connection with payment for purported management services to be provided by certain of the
defendants. The Company continues to believe that its position in the litigation is well-taken and supported by the facts and
will continue to proceed with respect to the remaining defendants. The litigation is in its early stages and the Company cannot
project whether it will achieve a successful result in connection with the remainder of the action or any other related actions.
Discovery has yet to be commenced and no trial date has been set. If the matter is taken to conclusion, the Company could incur
additional legal expenses in an amount which cannot be determined or estimated at this time.  

Other
than the aforementioned matter, there are no other legal proceedings which are pending or have been threatened against the Company
or any of its officers, directors or control persons of which management is aware.

Business
Overview  

Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the  Company ) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy,
biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group
Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution
and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC ( AMG Renewables ), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group,
LLC ( AMG Energy ), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC ( Carbolosic ), which
holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal in acquiring
the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective
licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on the Company s
renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries.
The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company s entertainment-related assets were generating
substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and
to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest
and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined
that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective
December 5, 2014, amended the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy
Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
Company is focused on one industry   Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AMG Renewables, LLC and Carbolosic
Plant 1, LLC, which in turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and Central Florida Institute of Science and
Technology, Inc., the Company has a strategy that includes growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions
and start-up activities which are focused on development of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement
of shareholder value.  

AMG
RENEWABLES, LLC  

AMG
Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables
has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Carbolosic Plant 1 ),
and two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Energy ) and
Ek Laboratories, Inc, a Florida corporation ( EK ).   

On
    December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties
    for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with
    the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated
    in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions,
    Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington
    Asset Holdings, Inc. As of the date of filing, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of
    this transaction, and as of such date, has not yet paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the books
    of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition.   

AMG
    Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Carbolosic ),
    which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
    known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
    into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal is to develop
    this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees.    

On
    May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed
    the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which will be renamed Carbolosic Energy SA PTY
    LTD ( Carbolosic SA ). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South Africa,
    Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through July 1,
    2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 ( License Fee ), which must be paid or
    guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty of 3.5% of
    the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed.   

Contemporaneously,
    Carbolosic SA s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of
    Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company ( Tes ), 24.5 % for Spearhead
    Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company ( Spearhead ), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust ( Jupiter )
    and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of
    Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead s
    interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company s interest is in exchange for
    the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed
    in the United States.   

In
    February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust
    resigned from management and from the board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic
    SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but, at this time, there is no guarantee that
    they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa
    in the coming months and decide on a path forward.    

On
    July 29, 2015, Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into two agreements with Renewable Resources
    Development of America, LLC ( RRDA ) related to the development of facilities by RRDA in North and South America
    which will utilize the Company s Cellulose to Sugar ( CTS ) technology. RRDA is engaged in construction
    and finance of facilities for municipal solid waste recovery and plastics, metals and paper recycling, chemical extraction
    from ore for manufacturing and cellulose material conversion into sugars for manufacture of bio-fuels, bio-plastics and other
    products. In connection with its business plan, RRDA is developing facilities using cellulose conversion technology.   

In
    this regard, the Company and RRDA entered into a Non-Exclusive Development Agreement ( Development Agreement )
    pursuant to which RRDA will utilize the CTS technology in the plants it develops. Under the Development Agreement, the Company
    would license its intellectual property to RRDA and provide certain consulting and educational services to RRDA. The specific
    terms of the license have yet to be determined. It is currently RRDA s plan to develop up to 56 plants.   

In
    addition, the Company and RRDA simultaneously entered into a Finance Agreement ( Finance Agreement ) pursuant
    to which the Company would receive $4 million cash in exchange for the following: (a) RRDA shall receive a number of shares
    of Company Common Stock such that at the closing of the financing RRDA would own ten percent (10%) of the number of issued
    and outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company; (b) RRDA would receive a Warrant to purchase two (2) million shares
    of Company Common Stock on terms to be agreed; (c) the license fee payable to the Company on account of the first plant being
    developed by RRDA in Georgia would be waived and (d) RRDA will designate two (2) persons to be appointed to the Company s
    Board of Directors.   

In
    March 2016, the Company canceled the Finance Agreement with RRDA due to a lack of funding in a timely manner. The Development
    Agreement remains in effect and any opportunities brought to the Company under this agreement will be subject to the same
    terms and conditions as any other license opportunity, including the proposed plant in Vidalia, Georgia.    

Carbolosic
    Plant 1 was created in October 2014 for the purpose of being a full scale facility for converting cellulose material into
    sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing located in Palm Beach County, FL. In March
    2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction of
    the outstanding $1,250,000 loan between Carbolosic Plant 1 and the Company.    

EK,
    was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name
    to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration
    and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies.    

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical
manufacturing industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.

the time of issuance. At the time of issuance of the convertible debt instruments set out above, the fair value of the stock was
either the same or less than the conversion price, and so there was no value attributable to any beneficial conversion feature.

Going
Concern  

The
Company has incurred losses since inception, has a working capital deficiency, and may be unable to raise further equity. At December
31, 2015 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $3,022,760 and had incurred accumulated losses of $17,052,797 since its
inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As
a result, the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm on the Company s financial statements
for the period ended December 31, 2015 contains an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet
its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay
its operating expenses. Furthermore, these Financial Statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Through
its private offerings, the Company raised $2,402,180 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and an additional $1,162,209 in the
year ended December 31, 2015. As of the date of filing, the company has received an additional $1,914,470 through its private
offerings.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the year ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014     

For
the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company s general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $2,484,940
to $5,330,832 from $7,815,772 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in legal,
accounting and consulting fees from $6,668,686 to $2,790,830, of which $2,281,273 is non-cash stock compensation. This reflects
a $3,877,856 reduction in these fees. The Company recognized no revenues from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014..  

Interest
expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2015 by approximately $178,249 to $189,394 from $11,145. This increase was the
result of interest accrued on $1,561,000 in short term debt notes received during 2015.  

For
the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company s equity loss in an unconsolidated affiliate was $180,354, down from $208,113
in 2014. This loss was mainly due to payroll and legal fees incurred by the non-consolidated affiliate, which mostly pertained
to global patent applications.  

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $125,861 expense resulting from the beneficial conversation features
of its convertible notes. The Company did not recognize an expense in 2014.  

For
the year ended December 31,, 2015, the Company s discontinued operations showed a profit of $668,269, as opposed to a $1,902,530
loss during the year ended December 31, 2014. This change is primarily the result of $26,631 in legal fees and $700,000 in cancelled
debt resulting from a settlement in connection with certain ongoing litigation. These amounts are the result of the Company s
decision in September 2014 to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries and to focus all of the
Company s resources and personnel on the Company s renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies.  

Research
and development (R D) costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $27,642, an increase of $26,677 from $965 for the year
ended December 31, 2014. The increase in R D expenses is the result of the opening of Ek Labortories, Inc. in June 2015 and
its purchases of gasses and other fine grade materials used in the CTS process.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity   

As
of December 31, 2015 the Company had $62,054 in cash. Total Stockholders  Equity at December 31, 2015 was $4,144,284. Total
debt from continuing operations, including advances, accounts payable and other notes payable at December 31, 2015, together with
interest payable thereon, was $5,096,682 an increase of $1,555,226 from $3,541,456 at December 31, 2014.  

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s continuing operating activities decreased $223,155 to $1,735,548
from $1,958,703 at December 31, 2014. This expense can primarily be attributed to $785,393 used in payroll, $509,557 in legal,
accounting and consulting fees and $189,722 in loan fees.  

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s investing activities used $543,874 in cash. This use can be attributed
to $214,225 used to purchase machinery and equipment, $202,021 in capitalized engineering costs and $115,941 advanced to Carbolosic,
LLC for operational costs.  

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated an aggregate of $2,168,894 through its financing activities. This
decrease of $1,294,544 from the prior year can primarily be attributed to a $1,239,971 decrease in the sale of common stock through
the Company s private offerings and $0 received through Company s partnership with Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, while
simultaneously securing $1,561,000 in new short-term debt notes.  

Capital
Resources   

At
this time, the Company has limited liquidity and capital resources. To continue funding the Company s operations, the company
will need to generate revenue and/or will require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance such projects it may
identify. As of the date of filing, the Company has raised $5,644,860 through its private placement offerings, however there is
no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company.  

The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company
to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to
reevaluate and revise its operations.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company s majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, after elimination
of intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s
proportionate share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment
assessment of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience
and other considerations reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Stock
Compensation   

The
Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments
include any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company s common stock or financial instruments that grant
the recipient the right to acquire shares of the Company s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist
only of awards made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments
to consultants, service providers and other non-employees are accounted for under in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic
505,  Equity Payments to Non-Employees  or other applicable authoritative guidance  

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities .  

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics
and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks
of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under
these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on
its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows when implemented.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this
Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification,
thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP.
In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information
in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development
stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose
in the first year in which the entity is no longer in a development stage that in prior years it had been in the development stage.  

The
amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is applicable to entities that have not commenced
planned principal operations. Finally, the amendments remove paragraph 810-10-15-16. Paragraph 810-10-15-16 states that a development
stage entity does not meet the condition in paragraph 810-10-15-14(a) to be a variable interest entity if (1) the entity can demonstrate
that the equity invested in the legal entity is sufficient to permit it to finance the activities that it is currently engaged
in and (2) the entity s governing documents and contractual arrangements allow additional equity investments. The amendments
in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining
whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments
to eliminate that exception simplify GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance
of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting
entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements
for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of
inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except
for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. For public business entities, those amendments are effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early application of each of the
amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have
not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no
longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-10 effective July 31, 2014.

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders  

   Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc. and Subsidiaries   

  West
Palm Beach, Florida  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not generated any revenue, has recurring losses since inception and has
a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts,
or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION   

Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the  Company ) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy,
biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group
Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution
and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC ( AMG Renewables ), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group,
LLC ( AMG Energy ), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC ( Carbolosic ), which
holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal in acquiring
the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective
licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on the Company s
renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries.
The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company s entertainment-related assets were generating
substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and
to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest
and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined
that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective
December 5, 2014, amended the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy
Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
Company is focused on one industry   Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AMG Renewables, LLC and Carbolosic
Plant 1, LLC, which in turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and Ek Laboratories, Inc., the Company has a
strategy that includes growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions and start-up activities which
are focused on development of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value.  

AMG
RENEWABLES, LLC    

AMG
Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables
has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Carbolosic Plant 1 ),
and two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Energy ) and
Ek Laboratories, Inc., a Florida corporation ( EK ) formerly known as Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology,
Inc.  

On
    December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties
    for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with
    the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated
    in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions,
    Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington
    Asset Holdings, Inc. As of September 30, 2015, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of
    this transaction, and as of such date, the Company has not paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the
    books of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition.   

AMG
    Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Carbolosic ),
    which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
    known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
    into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal is to develop
    this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees.    

On
    May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed
    the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which will be renamed Carbolosic Energy SA PTY
    LTD ( Carbolosic SA ). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South Africa,
    Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through July 1,
    2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 ( License Fee ), which must be paid or
    guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty of 3.5% of
    the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed. Until the
    $25,000,000 payment has been received, the Company does not consider all of the events required under the agreement to have
    been completed. Therefore the Company has not recorded and of the fee in the accompanying financial statements.   

Contemporaneously,
    Carbolosic SA s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of
    Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company ( Tes ), 24.5 % for Spearhead
    Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company ( Spearhead ), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust ( Jupiter )
    and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of
    Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead s
    interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company s interest is in exchange for
    the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed
    in the United States.   

In
    February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust
    resigned from management and from the Board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic
    SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but at this time there is no guarantee that
    they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa
    in the coming months and decide on a path forward.    

Carbolosic
    Plant 1 was created in October 2014 for the purpose of being a full scale facility for converting cellulose material into
    sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing located in Palm Beach County, FL. In March
    2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction of
    the outstanding $1,250,000 loan between Carbolosic Plant 1 and Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP.    

EK,
    was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name
    to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration
    and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies.    

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical
manufacturing industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenue, has incurred losses since inception,
has a working capital deficiency of $3,022,760 and may be unable to raise further equity. At December 31, 2015 the Company had
incurred accumulated losses of $17,052,797 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional liabilities
in connection with its start-up activities. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability
to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient
revenues from its operations to pay its operating expenses. These Financial Statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
result from this uncertainty. There are no assurances that the Company will continue as a going concern.  

Management
believes that the Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash
from operating activities and obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient
cash from operations, sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds. The Company s inability to obtain additional
cash could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and its ability to continue in existence.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty  

The
Company intends to raise additional capital, sell licenses to its CTS technology and continue constructing its full scale demonstration
facility which, once operational, is expected to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to cover the Company s operating
expenses and debt service.  

The
Company raised $2,402,180 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and an additional $1,162,209 in the year ended December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company s majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s
proportionate share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment
assessment of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience
and other considerations reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

All
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.  

Stock
Compensation   

The
Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments
include any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company s common stock or financial instruments that grant
the recipient the right to acquire shares of the Company s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist
only of awards made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments
to consultants, service providers and other non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic 505,  Equity
Payments to Non-Employees  or other applicable authoritative guidance.  

Stock-based
Compensation Valuation Methodology   

Stock-based
compensation resulting from the issuance of common stock is calculated by reference to the valuation of the stock on the date
of issuance, the expense being recognized as the compensation is earned. Stock-based compensation expenses related to employee
options and warrants granted to non-employees are recognized as the stock options and warrants are earned. The fair value of the
stock options or warrants granted is estimated at the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the expense
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the life of the
option or warrant. The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model on the basis of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the measurement date, adjusted for the unique
characteristics of those equity instruments, using the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value of the common stock
is determined by the then-prevailing closing market price. Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company s
closing day market price per share. The expected term of options and warrants was based upon the life of the option, and the risk-free
rate used was based on the U.S. Treasury Daily Yield Curve Rate.  

The
stock compensation issued for services during the year ended December 31, was valued on the date of issuance. The following assumptions
were used in calculations of the Black-Scholes option pricing models for warrant-based stock compensation issued in the year ended
December 31, 2015:  

Accounting
and Reporting of Discontinued Operations   

As
required by the FASB ASC Subtopic 205.20, per ASU 2014-08, Discontinued Operations, a component of an entity or a group of components
of an entity, or a business or nonprofit activity can be classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic
shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when any of the following occurs:
(i) the criteria in paragraph 205.20.45.1E to be classified as held for sale is met (ii) the component is disposed of by sale,
or (iii) the component is disposed of other than by sale in accordance with paragraph 360.10.45.15 (for example, by abandonment
or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff). Certain components to be disposed of other than by sale shall continue to be classified
as  held and used  until it is disposed of, per the requirements of ASC Subtopic 360.10. Depreciation on these assets
ceases upon their classification as  held and used.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-08 effective September 1, 2014.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the
useful lives of the assets, generally 5 to 7 years. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance
are expensed as incurred.  

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities .  

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics
and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks
of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under
these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.  

Common
Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments   

The
Company classifies as equity any contracts that require physical settlement or net-share settlement or provide it with a choice
of net-cash settlement or settlement in the Company s own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided
that such contracts are indexed to its own stock as defined in ASC 815-40 ( Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ).
The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net
cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company s control) or give the counterparty
a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses the
classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other free-standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether
a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.  

Non-controlling
interest in consolidated subsidiaries   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. and those subsidiaries that
the Company has the ability to control either through voting rights or means other than voting rights. For these subsidiaries,
the Company records 100% of the revenues, expenses, cash flows, assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements.
For subsidiaries that the Company controls but hold less than 100% ownership, a non-controlling interest is recorded in the consolidated
income statement to reflect the non-controlling interest s share of the net income (loss), and a non-controlling interest
is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the non-controlling interest s share of the net assets of the subsidiary.  

Investments
in non-consolidated affiliates   

Investments
in non-consolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or
the Company s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When
the equity method is used, investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company s
proportionate share of the investees  net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment
are accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional
losses are not provided for. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently
reports net income and the Company s share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the
period the equity method was suspended. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value
that is other than temporary has occurred.  

The
Company s investment in Carbolosic, LLC is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company monitors its
investment for impairment at least annually and make appropriate reductions in the carrying value if it determines that an impairment
charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information.  

Impairment
of Long Lived Assets    

Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group
may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable,
the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding interest costs, expected
to be generated by the asset group and their ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds
the fair value of the asset group. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less
costs to sell.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes. 
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

ASC
Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions
for any of the reporting periods presented.  

Profit
(Loss) per Common Share:   

Basic
profit (loss) per share amounts have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each
reporting period. Diluted loss per share has been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares plus the potentially
dilutive effect of securities such as outstanding options and warrants. The computation of potential common shares has been performed
using the treasury stock method. The warrants and options are antidilutive for all periods presented. When net loss is reported,
diluted and basic net loss per share amounts are the same as the impact of potential common shares is antidilutive.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value
as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair
value measurements.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, payables to related parties, and accounts payable and accrued expenses
are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

Level
2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

Level
3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on
its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows when implemented.  

NOTE
4   INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES   

On
December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group, LLC a Florida limited liability company ( AMG

effective tax rate is as follows:  

The

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2015
and 2014 are as follows:  

As
of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $17,052,797 and $12,208,326 of Federal net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs )

all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based
on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

The
Company files U.S. Federal and Florida tax returns that are subject to audit by tax authorities beginning with the year ended

tax expense.

ITEM
9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

(a)
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Company is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its chief executive officer (also its principal executive
officer) and its chief financial officer (also its principal financial and accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company s management, including
the Company s President ( President ), the Company s principal executive officer ( CEO ) and
Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), have evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation the Company s CEO, President and CFO concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015 to a reasonable assurance
level to enable the Company to record, process, summarize and report information required under the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules in a timely fashion. This conclusion resulted from the lack of separation of duties within the Company and lack of a functioning
Audit Committee.  

(b) Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
                                         to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
                                         the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;   

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
                                         of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
                                         the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
                                         made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
                                         and   

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
                                         use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on
                                         the financial statements.    

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  

As
of December 31, 2015, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting using
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, the Company concluded that, during
the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application
of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of its internal
controls over financial reporting that adversely affected its internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was (a) the lack of a functioning audit committee, (b) there are
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements, (c) there is a lack of expertise with US generally accepted accounting principles
and SEC rules and regulations for review of critical accounting areas and disclosures and material non-standard transactions and
(d) lack of effective oversight during the financial close process resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and
monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company s
management in connection with the review of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Management
believes that the material weakness set forth above did not have an effect on its financial results. However, management believes
that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors, coupled with not having individuals
on staff or retainer with a thorough knowledge of US GAAP and SEC rules and regulations and lack of effective oversight on the
financial close process results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and
procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in its financial statements in future periods.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by its registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.  

Remediation
Plan   

Management
is sensitive to the issues presented and intends to take appropriate action when the Company s financial resources permit.
In April 2014, the Company hired a Corporate Controller and intends to hire additional support staff when its financial resources
permit. Management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of its internal control environment.  

(c)
Reclassification of prior Period Financial Statements   

Certain
items previously reported have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation.  

(d)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

this methodology was the catalyst which allowed AgCert International to construct over 725 biodigesters impacting more than 94%
of the qualifying concentrated animal feeding operations in Mexico and Brazil. The construction and operation of these biogiesters
dramatically improved each farms local environment impact while also lowering their carbon intensity. The cooperation between
AgCert and the local farmers enabled the use of the Clean Development Mechanism of the UNFCC to produce and market millions of
certified emissions for the purchasers, as well as covering the costs of each farms biodigesters.

Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert  

The
Company does not currently have a functioning audit committee and the Company s entire board of directors handles the functions
that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. The company expects to designate an audit committee of its board of directors
in the near future.  

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.  

Section
16(a) of the Securities Act of 1934 requires the Company s officers and directors, and greater than 10% stockholders, to
file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of its securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of the
reports are required by SEC regulation to be furnished to the Company. Based on management s review of these reports during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, all reports required to be filed were filed on a timely basis.   

Code

ITEM
11.   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  

The
Company s compensation philosophy is based on its belief that its compensation programs should be aligned with stockholders 
interests and business objectives; reward performance; and be externally competitive and internally equitable. The Company seeks
to achieve three objectives, which serve as guidelines in making compensation decisions:  

1.    Providing
                                         a total compensation package which is competitive and therefore enables it to attract
                                         and retain, high-caliber executive personnel;   

2.    Integrating
                                         compensation programs with its short-term and long-term strategic plan and business objectives;
                                         and   

3.    Encouraging
                                         achievement of business objectives and enhancement of stockholder value by providing
                                         executive management long-term incentive through equity ownership.    

The
Company may compensate its officers with cash compensation, common stock and common stock options. The Company has not established
any quantifiable criteria with respect to the level of compensation, stock grants or options. Rather, the Board of Directors will
evaluate cash, stock grants and stock options paid to similarly situated companies. The Company does not currently have a functioning
compensation committee and the Company s entire board of directors handles the functions that would otherwise be handled
by a compensation committee.   

With
respect to stock grants and options which may be issued to the Company s officers and directors, the Board will consider
an overall compensation package that includes both cash and stock based compensation which would be in line with the Company s
overall operations and compensation levels paid to similarly situated companies. Under the Company s 2012 Employee, Director
Stock Plan, the administrator can provide for the grant of non-qualified stock options ( Non-Qualified Stock Options ),
incentive stock options ( ISOs , together with Non-Qualified Stock Options referred to herein as  Stock Options ),
stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock ( Restricted Stock ) and registered stock ( Registered
Stock ), (collectively, the  Awards ) to eligible Participants.  

The
following table sets forth the compensation paid by the Company to its officers and directors for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. This information includes the dollar value of base salaries, bonus awards and number of stock options
granted, and certain other compensation, if any. The compensation discussed addresses all compensation awarded to, earned by,
or paid to its named executive

ITEM
13.   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE   

Related
Transactions   

1. In
January 2015, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Prelude Motorsports, Inc. calling for semi-monthly payments
of $10,000. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, the consultant will review and provide input on a variety of areas including
corporate structure, marketing materials, website and promotional pieces; provide introductions to various organizations and individuals
who might support the Company s business development  

2. Throughout
2013, the Company issued unsecured short-term notes payable to various related parties, including officers and directors of the
Company, with a term of one year, which have since been extended. At September 30, 2015, there was one consolidated note outstanding
to Palm Beach Energy Solutions, LLC. The note has an outstanding principal balance of $71,000 and bears interest at a rate of
5% per annum.  

3. Mark
W. Koch and Daniel de Liege are principals of AMG Energy Solutions, Inc, which owns 43% of AMG Energy Group, LLC. The company
owns 51% of AMG Energy Group, LLC.  

The
officers and directors for the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other
business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between
the Company and their other business interest. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.  

4. In
December 2014, EK Laboratories, Inc. ( EK ), a Florida corporation, was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG
Energy Group, LLC. EK was created to operate as a research facility to further develop the CTS technology and develop new emerging
technologies. AMG Energy Group, LLC is owned 51% by the Company and 43% is owned by AMG Energy Solutions, Inc, of which Daniel
de Liege and Mark W. Koch are principals.  

5. In
November 2015, the Company issued a short-term, unsecured note payable to a shareholder of the company. The principal amount of
the note was $10,290, accrued interest at 5% per annum and had a term of one-year. On December 8, 2015, the note was paid in full
along with $32 in interest.  

Director
Independence   

The
Company currently has three (3) independent directors within the meaning of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200. Although there are only
three (3) independent directors, due to the business and financial expertise of the CEO, the company feels that the current board
can competently perform the functions that an independent Board of Directors would provide.  

ITEM
14.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.   

Audit
Fees    

The
aggregate fees billed by the Company s auditors, Paritz   Co. P.A. for professional services rendered for the audit
of its annual financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and review its interim financial statements for the
first, second and third quarters of 2016 will be approximately $40,000 The aggregate fees billed by the Company s auditors,
Paritz   Co P.A., for professional services rendered for the audit of its annual financial statements for fiscal year ended
December 31, 2014 and review its interim financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2015 were approximately
$40,000.  

Audit
Related fees    

During
the past fiscal year, no fees were billed or incurred for assurance or related services by the Company s auditors that were
reasonably related to the audit or review of financial statements reported above.  

Tax
Fees    

During
the past fiscal year, $4,500 was billed by the Company s auditors for tax preparation fees for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015.  

All
Other Fees    

During
the past fiscal year, no other fees were billed or incurred for services by the Company s auditors other than the fees noted
above. The Company s board, acting as an audit committee, deemed the fees charged to be compatible with maintenance of the
independence of its auditors.  

The
Board of Directors Preapproval Policies     

The
Company does not currently have a functioning audit committee and the Company s entire board of directors handles the functions
that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. The company expects to designate an audit committee of its board of directors
in the near future. Before an independent auditor is engaged by the Company to render audit or non-audit services, the Company s
board of directors pre-approves the engagement. Board of directors pre-approval of audit and non-audit services will not be required
if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Company s
board of directors regarding its engagement of the independent auditor, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to
the particular service, its board of directors is informed of each service provided, and such policies and procedures do not include
delegation of its board of directors  responsibilities under the Exchange Act to its management. The Company s board
of directors may delegate to one or more designated members of its board of directors the authority to grant pre-approvals, provided
such approvals are presented to the board of directors at a subsequent meeting. If the board of directors elects to establish
pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the board of directors must be informed of each non-audit service
provided by the independent auditor. Board of directors pre-approval of non-audit services, other than review and attest services,
also will not be required if such services fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. For the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, 100% of audit-related services, tax services and other services performed by the Company s independent
auditors were pre-approved by its board of directors.  

The
Company s board has considered whether the services described above under the caption  All Other Fees , which
are currently none, is compatible with maintaining the auditor s independence.  

The
board approved all fees described above.

                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

5.    I
                                         have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
                                         reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s
                                         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):    

a.    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and   

b.    Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
