Franklin Street Properties Corp.     Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements       (Unaudited) 

1.  Organization, Properties, Basis of Presentation, Financial Instruments and Recent Accounting Standards 

Organization 

Franklin Street Properties Corp. ( FSP Corp.  or the  Company ), holds, directly and indirectly, 100% of the interest in FSP Investments LLC, FSP Property Management LLC, FSP Holdings LLC and FSP Protective TRS Corp.  FSP Property Management LLC provides asset management and property management services.  The Company also has a non-controlling common stock interest in seven corporations organized to operate as real estate investment trusts ( REIT ) and a non-controlling preferred stock interest in two of those REITs.  Collectively, the seven REITs are referred to as the  Sponsored REITs . 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned and operated a portfolio of real estate consisting of 36 operating properties, one property that is in redevelopment and seven managed Sponsored REITs; and held five promissory notes secured by mortgages on real estate owned by Sponsored REITs, including two mortgage loans and three revolving lines of credit.  From time-to-time, the Company may acquire, develop or redevelop real estate, make additional secured loans or acquire a Sponsored REIT.  The Company may also pursue, on a selective basis, the sale of its properties in order to take advantage of the value creation and demand for its properties, or for geographic or property specific reasons. 

Properties 

The following table summarizes the Company s number of operating properties and rentable square feet of real estate.  In January 2016, the Company classified one property as a redevelopment, which is excluded as of September 30, 2016. 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include all the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited; however, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for these interim periods have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016 or for any other period. 

Financial Instruments 

As disclosed in Note 4, the Company s derivatives are recorded at fair value using Level 2 inputs.   

7 

Table of Contents  

The Company estimates that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, loans receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued compensation, tenant security deposits approximate their fair values based on their short-term maturity and the bank note and term loans payable approximate their fair values as they bear interest at variable interest rates. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  .  This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.  This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The implementation of this update is not expected to cause any significant changes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. ASU 2015-02 was adopted on January 1, 2016.  The implementation of this update did not cause any material changes to the consolidated financial statements for any period. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , ( ASU 2016-02).  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting. The guidance also eliminates today s real estate-specific provisions for all entities. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  This new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the condensed consolidated financial statements.   

Reclassification 

Certain amounts from the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. The reclassification was related primarily to conform to ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.  This new standard was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and requires retrospective application.  Approximately $2.4 million of debt issuance costs were reclassified from other assets to contra term loans on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015. There was no change to net income for any period presented as a result of this reclassification.

2.  Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities 

Investment in Sponsored REITs: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held a common stock interest in seven and nine Sponsored REITs, respectively.  The Company holds a non-controlling preferred stock investment in two of these Sponsored REITs, FSP 303 East Wacker Drive Corp. ( East Wacker ) and FSP Grand Boulevard Corp. ( Grand Boulevard ), from which it continues to derive economic benefits and risks. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, a property owned by a Sponsored REIT was sold and, thereafter, liquidating distributions to its preferred shareholders were declared and issued.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two properties owned by two Sponsored REITs, FSP 385 Interlocken Development Corp. ( 385 Interlocken ) and FSP Lakeside Crossing II LLC ( Lakeside II ), were sold and, thereafter, liquidating distributions to their preferred shareholders were declared and issued.  The Company had previously made a secured construction loan to 385 Interlocken, which loan in the outstanding principal amount of $37,541,000 was repaid in its entirety from the proceeds of the sale.    

Equity in losses of investment in non-consolidated REITs: 

The following table includes equity in losses of investments in non-consolidated REITs 

Equity in losses of investments in non-consolidated REITs is derived from the Company s share of income or loss in the operations of those entities.  The Company exercises influence over, but does not control these entities, and investments are accounted for using the equity method. 

Equity in losses of East Wacker is derived from the Company s preferred stock investment in the entity.  In December 2007, the Company purchased 965.75 preferred shares or 43.7% of the outstanding preferred shares of East Wacker for $82,813,000 (which represented $96,575,000 at the offering price net of commissions of $7,726,000, loan fees of $5,553,000 and acquisition fees of $483,000 that were excluded). 

Equity in losses of Grand Boulevard is derived from the Company s preferred stock investment in the entity.  In May 2009, the Company purchased 175.5 preferred shares or 27.0% of the outstanding preferred shares of Grand Boulevard for $15,049,000 (which represented $17,550,000 at the offering price net of commissions of $1,404,000, loan fees of $1,009,000 and acquisition fees of $88,000 that were excluded). 

The Company recorded distributions of $691,000 and $81,000 from non-consolidated REITs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Management fees and interest income from loans: 

Asset management fees range from 1% to 5% of collected rents and the applicable contracts are cancelable with 30 days notice.  Asset management fee income from non-consolidated entities amounted to approximately $474,000 and $523,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

From time to time the Company may make secured loans ( Sponsored REIT Loans ) to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other

purposes. The Company reviews Sponsored REIT loans for impairment each reporting period. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts recorded on the balance sheet. The Company applies normal loan review and underwriting procedures (as may be implemented or modified from time to time) in making that judgment. None of the Sponsored REIT loans have been impaired.    

The Company anticipates that each Sponsored REIT Loan will be repaid at maturity or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or some other capital event.  Each Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately one to three years.  Except for two mortgage loans which bear interest at a fixed rate, advances under each Sponsored REIT Loan bear interest at a rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR rate plus an agreed upon amount of basis points and also require a 50 basis point draw fee. 

The following is a summary of the Sponsored REIT Loans outstanding as of September 30, 2016: 

(1) 

The interest rate is 30-day LIBOR rate plus the additional rate indicated, otherwise a fixed rate.     

(2) 

The draw fee is a percentage of each new advance, and is paid at the time of each new draw.     

(5) 

This mortgage loan includes an annual extension fee of $108,900 paid by the borrower.       

The Company recognized interest income and fees from the Sponsored REIT Loans of approximately $3,634,000 and $3,833,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Non-consolidated REITs: 

The balance sheet data below for 2016 and 2015 includes the 7 and 9 Sponsored REITs the Company held an interest in as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The operating data below for 2016 and 2015 include the operations of the 9 and 10 Sponsored REITs in which the Company held an interest in during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

3.  Bank Note Payable and Term Note Payable 

BMO Term Loan 

On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the  BMO First Amendment ) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 (among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank f Montreal, as administrative agent ( as amended by the BMO First Amendment, the  BMO Credit Agreement ). The BMO Credit Agreement provides for a single, unsecured term loan borrowing in the amount of $220,000,000 (the  BMO Term Loan ) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The BMO Term Loan matures on August 26, 2020. The BMO Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows up to $50,000,000 of additional loans, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. 

The BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (165 basis points over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (65 basis points over the base rate at September 30, 2016).   

Although the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate by entering into an interest rate swap agreement.  On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum for seven years, until the August 26, 2020 maturity date.  Accordingly, based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the effective interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 3.97% per annum.   

The BMO Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type.  The BMO Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum unsecured interest coverage and a maximum ratio of certain investments to total assets. The Company was in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BMO Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to refinance or

retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BMO Credit Agreement.   

BAML Credit Facility 

On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the  BAML First Amendment ) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (as amended by the BAML First Amendment, the  BAML Credit Facility ) that continued an existing unsecured revolving line of credit (the  BAML Revolver ) and extended the maturity of a term loan (the  BAML Term Loan ).   

BAML Revolver Highlights 

The BAML Revolver is for borrowings, at the Company s election, of up to $500,000,000.  Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit, the combined sum of which may not exceed $500,000,000   outstanding at any time.     

Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the initial maturity date of October 29, 2018.  The Company has the right to extend the initial maturity date of the BAML Revolver by an additional 12 months, or until October 29, 2019, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.     

The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $350,000,000 of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.     

As of September 30, 2016, there were borrowings of $278,000,000 outstanding under the BAML Revolver.  The BAML Revolver bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (1.25% over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (0.25% over the base rate at September 30, 2016). The BAML Credit Facility also obligates the Company to pay an annual facility fee in an amount that is also based on the Company s credit rating (0.25% at September 30, 2016). The facility fee is assessed against the total amount of the BAML Revolver, or $500,000,000.  

Based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 1.77% per annum. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 1.54% per annum and there were borrowings of $290,000,000 outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 1.70% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 1.44% per annum. 

BAML Term Loan Highlights 

The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $350,000,000 of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.       

The BAML Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (1.45% over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (0.45% over the base rate at September 30, 2016).

Table of Contents  

Although the interest rate on the BAML Credit Facility is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan by entering into an interest rate swap agreement. On September 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 0.75% per annum until September 27, 2017.  On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 1.12% per anum for the period beginning on September 27, 2017 and ending on September 27, 2021.  Accordingly, based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the effective interest rate on the BAML Term Loan was 2.20% per annum. 

BAML Credit Facility General Information

The BAML Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum unsecured interest coverage and a maximum ratio of certain investments to total assets. The Company was in compliance with the BAML Credit Facility financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BAML Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to refinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BAML Credit Facility. 

4.  Financial Instruments: Derivatives and Hedging 

On July 22, 2016, the Company fixed the interest rate for the period beginning on September 27, 2017 and ending on September 27, 2021 on the BAML Term Loan with an interest rate swap agreement (the  2017 Interest Rate Swap ), on August 26, 2013, the Company fixed the interest rate until August 26, 2020 on the BMO Term Loan with an interest rate swap agreement (the  BMO Interest Rate Swap ), and on September 27, 2012, the Company fixed the interest rate on the BAML Term Loan until September 27, 2017 with an interest rate swap agreement (the  BAML Interest Rate Swap ). The variable rates that were fixed under the BMO Interest Rate Swap, the BAML Interest Rate Swap and the 2017 Interest Rate Swap are described in Note 3. 

The BMO Interest Rate Swap, the BAML Interest Rate Swap and the 2017 Interest Rate Swap qualify as cash flow hedges and have been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.  If a derivative qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings, which may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders  equity prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. 

The following table summarizes the notional and fair value of our derivative financial instruments at September 30, 2016. The notional value is an indication of the extent of our involvement in these instruments at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 

On September 30, 2016, the BMO Interest Rate Swap was reported as a liability at its fair value of approximately $11.6. million, the BAML Interest Rate Swap was reported as a liability at its fair value of approximately $0.3 million and the 2017 Interest Rate Swap was reported as a liability at its fair value of approximately $0.8 million.  These are included in other

liabilities: derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  Offsetting adjustments are reported as unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income of $5.1 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $4.0 million was reclassified out of other comprehensive income and into interest expense. 

Over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings as an increase or reduction to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings.  The Company estimates that approximately $3.2 million of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. 

The Company is hedging the exposure to variability in anticipated future interest payments on existing debt. 

The fair value of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using the net discounted cash flows of the expected cash flows of the derivative based on the market based interest rate curve and are adjusted to reflect credit or nonperformance risk.  The risk is estimated by the Company using credit spreads and risk premiums that are observable in the market. These financial instruments were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and were classified as an asset or liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company s derivatives are recorded at fair value in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated Balance Sheet and the effective portion of the derivatives  fair value is recorded to other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statements of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion of the derivatives  fair value is recognized directly into earnings as other in the condensed consolidated statements of income.    

The interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the BAML Term Loan and BMO Term Loan, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swaps whereas the BAML Term Loan and BMO Term Loan are subject to a zero percent floor. As a result there is a mismatch and the ineffective portion of the derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded ($0.6) million and $0.4 million, respectively, of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings, which is included in other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income.   

In the event that LIBOR is negative, the Company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between LIBOR and zero, which will be included in interest expense in on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.   

5.  Net Income Per Share 

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of Company shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares.  There were no potential dilutive shares outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

6.  Stockholders  Equity 

On August 16, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 7,043,750 shares of its common stock (including 918,750 shares issued as a result of the full exercise of an overallotment option by the underwriter) at a price to the public of $12.35 per share. The proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriter discounts and offering costs, totaled approximately $82.9 million.   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 107,231,155 shares of common stock outstanding.  The Company declared and paid dividends as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

7.  Income Taxes 

General 

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). As a REIT, the Company generally is entitled to a tax deduction for distributions paid to its shareholders, thereby effectively subjecting the distributed net income of the Company to taxation at the shareholder level only.  The Company must comply with a variety of restrictions to maintain its status as a REIT.  These restrictions include the type of income it can earn, the type of assets it can hold, the number of shareholders it can have and the concentration of their ownership, and the amount of the Company s taxable income that must be distributed annually. 

One such restriction is that the Company generally cannot own more than 10% of the voting power or value of the securities of any one issuer unless the issuer is itself a REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ).  In the case of TRSs, the Company s ownership of securities in all TRSs generally cannot exceed 25% of the value of all of the Company s assets and, when considered together with other non-real estate assets, cannot exceed 25% of the value of all of the Company s assets.  FSP Investments LLC and FSP Protective TRS Corp. are the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries operating as taxable corporations under the Code. 

Income taxes are recorded based on the future tax effects of the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the Company s assets and liabilities.  In estimating future tax consequences, potential future events are considered except for potential changes in income tax law or in rates. 

The Company adopted an accounting pronouncement related to uncertainty in income taxes effective January 1, 2007, which did not result in recording a liability, nor was any accrued interest and penalties recognized with the adoption.  Accrued interest and penalties will be recorded as income tax expense, if the Company records a liability in the future.  The Company s effective tax rate was not affected by the adoption.  The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.  The statute of limitations for the Company s income tax returns is generally three years and as such, the Company s returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2013 and thereafter.

The Company is subject to a business tax known as the Revised Texas Franchise Tax.  Some of the Company s leases allow reimbursement by tenants for these amounts because the Revised Texas Franchise Tax replaces a portion of the property tax for school districts.  Because the tax base on the Revised Texas Franchise Tax is derived from an income based measure, it is considered an income tax.  The Company recorded a provision for the Revised Texas Franchise Tax of $261,000 and $416,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Net operating losses 

Section 382 of the Code restricts a corporation s ability to use net operating losses ( NOLs ) to offset future taxable income following certain  ownership changes.  Such ownership changes occurred with past mergers and accordingly a portion of the NOLs incurred by the Sponsored REITs available for use by the Company in any particular future taxable year will be limited. To the extent that the Company does not utilize the full amount of the annual NOLs limit, the unused amount may be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. NOLs expire 20 years after the year in which they arise, and the last of the Company s NOLs will expire in 2027. A valuation allowance is provided for the full amount of the NOLs as the realization of any tax benefits from such NOLs is not assured.  The gross amount of NOLs available to the Company was $13,041,000 as of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Income Tax Expense 

The income tax expense reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income relates primarily to a franchise tax on our Texas properties.  FSP Protective TRS Corp. provides taxable services to tenants at some of the Company s properties and the tax expenses associated with these activities are reported as Other Taxes in the table below: 

Taxes on income are a current tax expense.  No deferred income taxes were provided as there were no material temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the TRSs. 

8.  Dispositions of properties 

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reached a decision to classify its office property located in Federal Way, Washington, as an asset held for sale.  In evaluating the Federal Way, Washington property, management considered various subjective factors, including the time, cost and likelihood of successfully leasing the property, the effect of the property s results on its unencumbered asset value, which is part of the leverage ratio used to compare to a maximum leverage covenant in the BMO Term Loan and the BAML Credit Facility, future capital costs to upgrade and reposition the multi-tenant property and to lease up the building, recent leasing and economic activity in the local area, and offers to purchase the property.  The Company concluded that selling the property was the more prudent decision and outweighed the potential future benefit of continuing to hold the property.   The property is expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $0.5 million and $5.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net of applicable income taxes and was classified as an asset held for sale at September 30, 2016.  The Company estimated the fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell using the offers to purchase the property made by third parties (Level 3 inputs, as there is no active market).  

The Company sold an office property located in Maryland Heights, Missouri on April 5, 2016, at a $4.2 million gain.  The Company sold an office property located in Plano, Texas on February 23, 2015 at a $1.5 million gain, an office property located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota on March 31, 2015 at a $9.0 million gain, an office property located in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 13, 2015 at a $0.9 million gain and an office property located in San Jose, California on December 9, 2015 at a $12.3 million gain.

The disposal or planned disposal of the properties does not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.  Accordingly, the properties remain classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.   

9.  Subsequent Events   

On October 7, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash distribution of $0.19 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016 to stockholders of record on October 21, 2016.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the condensed consolidated financial statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations.  The following discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may also contain forward-looking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management, which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements.  Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Investors are cautioned that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, economic conditions in the United States, disruptions in the debt markets, economic conditions in the markets in which we own properties, risks of a lessening of demand for the types of real estate owned by us, uncertainties relating to fiscal policy, changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical events, and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs, additional staffing, insurance increases and real estate tax valuation reassessments.  See Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  below.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  We may not update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations that occur after such date, other than as required by law. 

Overview   

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused on commercial real estate investments in office markets throughout the United States. Our principal revenue sources from our real estate operations include rental income from real estate leasing, interest income from secured loans made on office properties, property dispositions and fee income from asset/property management and development.  Our current strategy is to invest in select urban infill and central business district properties, with primary emphasis on our top five markets of Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis.  We believe that our top five markets have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents.  We will also monitor other markets for opportunistic investments.   We seek value-oriented investments with an eye towards long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income. 

As of September 30, 2016, approximately 7.1 million square feet, or approximately 72.9% of our total owned portfolio, was located in our top five markets.  From time to time we may dispose of our smaller, suburban office assets and replace them with larger urban infill and central business district office assets located primarily in our top five markets.  As we execute this strategy, short term operating results could be adversely impacted.  However, we believe that the transformed portfolio has the potential to provide higher profit and asset value growth over a longer period of time.  

The main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the United States.  These market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level.  We have no influence on broader economic/market conditions.  We look to acquire and/or develop quality properties in established, growth-oriented locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.  The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Table of Contents  

Critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.  We believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations.  No changes to our critical accounting policies have occurred since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  .  This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.  This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The implementation of this update is not expected to cause any significant changes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. ASU 2015-02 was adopted on January 1, 2016.  The implementation of this update did not cause any material changes to the consolidated financial statements for any period.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , ( ASU 2016-02).  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting. The guidance also eliminates today s real estate-specific provisions for all entities. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  This new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2018, and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the condensed consolidated financial statements.    

Trends and Uncertainties 

Economic Conditions 

The economy in the United States is continuing to experience a period of slow economic growth, with continued declining unemployment rates, which directly affects the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset.  The broad economic market conditions in the United States are affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, inflation and employment levels, energy prices, the pace of economic growth and/or recessionary concerns, uncertainty about government fiscal and tax policy, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, the regulatory environment, the availability of credit and interest rates.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank has indicated that it anticipates raising interest rates further in 2016.  Any increase in interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs to us.  However, we could also benefit from   

19 

Table of Contents  

any further improved economic fundamentals and increasing levels of employment.  We believe that the economy is in a cyclically-slower but prolonged broad-based upswing.  However, future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values, occupancy levels and property income. 

Real Estate Operations 

Leasing 

Our real estate portfolio was approximately 89.5% leased as of September 30, 2016, a decrease from 91.6% as of December 31, 2015.  The 2.1% decrease in leased space was a result of lease expirations and terminations during 2016 that were not leased at September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, we had 1,016,000 square feet of vacancy in our portfolio compared to 800,000 square feet of vacancy at December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we leased approximately 869,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 658,000 square feet were with existing tenants, at a weighted average term of 6.8 years.  On average, tenant improvements for such leases were $19.27 per square foot, lease commissions were $10.35 per square foot and rent concessions were approximately four months of free rent.  Average GAAP base rents under such leases were $27.94 per square foot, or 8.2% higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In January 2016, our property at 801 Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with approximately 170,000 square feet of space, became vacant and we are redeveloping the property.  After extensive costing analysis with our potential development partners and outside professionals, we have decided to redevelop the existing building ourselves, rather than raze it and build a new, mixed use tower with outside development partners.  Interior demolition and construction work commenced during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  We estimate the total redevelopment cost to be between $15 and $20 million, including leasing costs.  We anticipate that the redevelopment will be complete at the end of first quarter 2017.  Upon completion, we expect the redevelopment to result in approximately 120,000 net rental square feet and for the property to attain rents of approximately $15 to $18 weighted average GAAP rent per square foot compared to previously expired rents of approximately $4.75 weighted average GAAP rent per square foot. 

As of September 30, 2016, leases for approximately 1.3% and 7.7% of the square footage in our portfolio are scheduled to expire during 2016 and 2017, respectively.  As the fourth quarter of 2016 begins, we believe that our property portfolio is well stabilized, with a balanced lease expiration schedule, and that existing vacancy is being actively marketed to numerous potential tenants.  We believe that most of our largest property markets are now experiencing generally steady or improving rental conditions.  We anticipate continued positive leasing activity within the portfolio during the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 

While we cannot generally predict when an existing vacancy in our real estate portfolio will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be, we expect to renew or sign new leases at then-current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located, which could be above or below the expiring rates.  Also, even as the economy recovers, we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy still exists.  If any of our tenants defaults on its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.  In addition, at any time, a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

Real Estate Acquisition and Investment Activity 

During 2016: 

on January 19, we received approximately $37.5 million from FSP 385 Interlocken Development Corp. as repayment in full of a Sponsored REIT Loan;      

during the nine months ended September 30, we received approximately $2.1 million from FSP Satellite Place Corp., as partial prepayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan;      

on June 6, we acquired an office property with approximately 325,800 rentable square feet for $82 million located in Minneapolis, Minnesota;      

20 

Table of Contents  

we have continued to actively explore additional potential real estate investment opportunities and anticipate further real estate investments in the future.     

During 2015: 

we funded advances on Sponsored REIT Loans for revolving lines of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.0 million;       

on April 8, we acquired an office property with approximately 442,130 rentable square feet of space for $78.0 million located in the Central Perimeter Submarket of Atlanta, Georgia: and     

on December 7, we funded a Sponsored REIT Loan consisting of a mortgage loan secured by a property of approximately $21.0 million.     

Dispositions of Properties and Asset Held for Sale 

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Federal Way, Washington, as an asset held for sale.  In evaluating the Federal Way, Washington property, management considered various subjective factors, including the time, cost and likelihood of successfully leasing the property, the effect of the property s results on its unencumbered asset value, which is part of the leverage ratio used to compare to a maximum leverage covenant in the BMO Term Loan and the BAML Credit Facility, future capital costs to upgrade and reposition the multi-tenant property and to lease up the building, recent leasing and economic activity in the local area, and offers to purchase the property.  We concluded that selling the property was the more prudent decision and outweighed the potential future benefit of continuing to hold the property.   The property is expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $0.5 million and $5.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, net of applicable income taxes and was classified as an asset held for sale at September 30, 2016.   

On April 5, 2016, we sold an office property located in Maryland Heights, Missouri at approximately a $4.2 million gain.  During 2015, we sold an office property located in Plano, Texas on February 23, 2015 at a $1.5 million gain, an office property located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota on March 31, 2015 at a $9.0 million gain, an office property located in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 13, 2015 at a $0.9 million gain and an office property located in San Jose, California on December 9, 2015 at a $12.3 million gain.   

We will continue to evaluate our portfolio, and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business.  We believe that the current property sales environment continues to improve in many markets relative to both liquidity and pricing.  We believe that both improving office property fundamentals as well as attractive financing availability will likely be required to continue improvement in the marketplace for potential property dispositions.  As an important part of our total return strategy, we intend to be active in property dispositions when we believe that market conditions warrant such activity and, as a consequence, we continuously review and evaluate our portfolio of properties for potentially advantageous dispositions.

Results of Operations 

The following table shows results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the three months ended September 30, 2015: 

Revenues 

Total revenues increased by $1.4 million to $63.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily a result of: 

This increase was partially offset by: 

The increase in total revenues was partially offset by a decrease in interest from loans of approximately $0.1 million primarily as a result of principal repayments.

Expenses 

Total expenses increased by $2.3 million to $60.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily a result of: 

An increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately $1.2 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million, both of which were attributable to the acquisition of a property we acquired on on June 6, 2016 and a property we acquired on August 10, 2016, and was partially offset by the disposition of two properties in the last twelve months.  We sold a property on each of December 9, 2015 and April 5, 2016.     

An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.3 million as a result of increases in acquisition costs and personnel related expenses.  We had 40 and 39 employees as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.          

An increase in interest expense of approximately $0.3 million to $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates and an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.       

Equity in losses of non-consolidated REITs 

Equity in losses from non-consolidated REITs decreased approximately $88,000 to a loss of $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily attributable to equity in the loss from our preferred stock investment in a Sponsored REIT, FSP 303 East Wacker Drive Corp., which we refer to as East Wacker, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Other 

Other expense was reduced by $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which is attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from our derivatives  fair value.  The ineffective portion of the derivatives  fair value are recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness.   

Gain on sale of property and provision for loss on property held for sale 

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Federal Way, Washington, as an asset held for sale.  The property is expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, net of applicable income taxes and was classified as an asset held for sale at September 30, 2016.   

Taxes on income 

Included in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, which is a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which decreased $35,000 and other income taxes, which increased $23,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Income 

Net Income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.5 million compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, for the reasons described above.

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

Revenues 

Total revenues increased by $1.3 million to $183.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily a result of: 

This increase was partially offset by: 

A decrease in interest income of approximately $0.2 million from loans as a result of loan repayments.

Expenses 

Total expenses increased by $1.5 million to $174.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily a result of: 

An increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately $1.2 million, which was attributable to the acquisition of properties on April 8, 2015 and June 6, 2016, partially offset by decreases as a result of the disposition of five properties in the last eighteen months.     

An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.3 million as a result of increases in acquisition costs and personnel related expenses.  We had 40 and 39 employees as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       

An increase in interest expense of approximately $0.6 million to $19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates and an increase to amortization of deferred financing costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.       

These increases were partially offset by: 

Equity in losses of non-consolidated REITs 

Equity in losses from non-consolidated REITs decreased approximately $0.1 million to a loss of $0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily because equity in the loss from our preferred stock investment in our East Wacker Sponsored REIT, decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Other 

Other expense of $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from our derivatives  fair value.  The ineffective portion of the derivatives  fair value are recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness.

Gain on sale of property and provision for loss on property held for sale 

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Federal Way, Washington, as an asset held for sale.  The property is expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net of applicable income taxes and was classified as an asset held for sale at September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold an office property located in Maryland Heights, Missouri on April 5, 2016, at a $4.1 million gain.  The provision for loss on the property held for sale nd the gain on sale of the property during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are presented combined as a $1.2 million loss.         

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we sold an office property located in Plano, Texas on February 23, 2015 at a $1.5 million gain, an office property located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota on March 31, 2015 at a $9.0 million gain and an office property located in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 13, 2015 at a $0.9 million gain. 

Taxes on income 

Included in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, which is a tax on revenues from Texas properties that decreased $155,000 and other taxes that increased $37,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Income 

Net Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.6 million compared to $19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, for the reasons described above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we changed the definition of FFO and NOI to exclude hedge ineffectiveness, which does not affect any prior period.  Our interest rate swaps effectively fix interest rates on our term loans, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swaps whereas the current term loans are subject to a zero percent floor. As a result there is a mismatch and the ineffective portion of the derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness. We believe that FFO and Property NOI excluding hedge ineffectiveness is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results.       

During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a  $0.6 million decrease and a $0.4 million increase in other expense, respectively, of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to the zero percent floor mismatch in the hedging relationships. 

Funds From Operations 

The Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders.  The Company defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness and acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized, plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs. 

FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company s needs. 

Other real estate companies and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT may define this term in a different manner.  We have included the NAREIT FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 

We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.

The calculations of FFO are shown in the following table: 

Net Operating Income (NOI) 

The Company provides property performance based on Net Operating Income, which we refer to as NOI.  Management believes that investors are interested in this information.  NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in both periods, which we call Same Store.  The Comparative Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude properties that are non-operating, being developed or redeveloped, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees.  NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company s liquidity or its ability to make distributions.  The calculations of NOI are shown in the following table:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash and cash equivalents were $13.4 million and $18.2 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease of $4.8 million is attributable to $65.2 million provided by operating activities and $10.9 million provided by financing activities,  less $80.9 million used by investing activities.  Management believes that existing cash, cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.  Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth, we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations.  We believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements, in addition to normal operating expenses.  Our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders, however, depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties. 

Operating Activities 

The cash provided by our operating activities of $65.2 million is primarily attributable to net income of $6.6 million excluding a gain on sale of a property of $4.1 million and provision for loss on a property held for sale of $5.3, plus the add-back of $68.6 million of non-cash expenses and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.0 million.  These increases were partially offset by a $9.2 million increase in payments of deferred leasing commissions, a $1.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $0.7 million increase in lease acquisition costs, a $0.5 million increase in tenant rent receivables and a $0.1 million decrease in tenant security deposits.   

Investing Activities 

Our cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $80.9 million is primarily attributable to the cost of two properties acquired during 2016 of approximately $119.1 million, purchases of other real estate assets and office equipment investments and office equipment of approximately $22.1 million.  These uses were partially offset by repayments received from related party mortgage receivables of $39.6 million, proceeds received from the sale of a property on April 5, 2016 of $20.0 million and distributions received from non-consolidated REITs of $0.7 million.   

Financing Activities 

Our cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $10.9 million is primarily attributable to net proceeds from an equity offering of common stock of $82.9 million, partially offset by distributions paid to stockholders of $57.1 million, net repayments on the BAML Revolver of $12.0 million and financing costs paid of $3.0 million.     

BMO Term Loan 

On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the  BMO First Amendment ) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (as amended by the BMO First Amendment, the  BMO Credit Agreement ). The BMO Credit Agreement provides for a single, unsecured term loan borrowing in the amount of $220,000,000 (the  BMO Term Loan ) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The BMO Term Loan matures on August 26, 2020. The BMO Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows up to $50,000,000 of additional loans, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. 

The BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (165 basis points over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (65 basis points over the base rate at September 30, 2016). 

Although the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate by entering into an interest rate swap agreement. On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum for seven years,

Table of Contents  

until the August 26, 2020 maturity date.  Accordingly, based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the effective interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 3.97% per annum. 

The BMO Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type.  The BMO Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum unsecured interest coverage and a maximum ratio of certain investments to total assets. The Company was in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BMO Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to refinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BMO Credit Agreement. 

BAML Credit Facility 

On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the  BAML First Amendment ) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014, among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (as amended by the BAML First Amendment, the  BAML Credit Facility ) that continued an existing unsecured revolving line of credit (the  BAML Revolver ) and extended the maturity of a term loan (the  BAML Term Loan ). 

BAML Revolver Highlights 

The BAML Revolver is for borrowings, at the Company s election, of up to $500,000,000.  Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit, the combined sum of which may not exceed $500,000,000 outstanding at any time.     

Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the initial maturity date of October 29, 2018.  The Company has the right to extend the initial maturity date of the BAML Revolver by an additional 12 months, or until October 29, 2019, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.     

The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $350,000,000 of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.     

As of September 30, 2016, there were borrowings of $278,000,000 outstanding under the BAML Revolver.  The BAML Revolver bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (1.25% over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (0.25% over the base rate at September 30, 2016). The BAML Credit Facility also obligates the Company to pay an annual facility fee in an amount that is also based on the Company s credit rating (0.25% at September 30, 2016). The facility fee is assessed against the total amount of the BAML Revolver, or $500,000,000. 

Based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 1.77% per annum.  As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 1.54% per annum.   The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately1.70% per annum.  The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 1.44% per annum.

The BAML Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company s credit rating (1.45% over LIBOR at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company s credit rating (0.45% over the base rate at September 30, 2016). The actual margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company s credit rating. 

Although the interest rate on the BAML Credit Facility is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan by entering into an interest rate swap agreement. On September 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 0.75% per annum until September 27, 2017.  On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 1.12% per anum for the period beginning on September 27, 2017 and ending on September 27, 2021.  Accordingly, based upon the Company s credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the effective interest rate on the BAML Term Loan was 2.20% per annum. 

BAML Credit Facility General Information 

The BAML Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type.  The BAML Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum unsecured interest coverage and a maximum ratio of certain investments to total assets. The Company was in compliance with the BAML Credit Facility financial covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BAML Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to refinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BAML Credit Facility. 

Equity Offering 

On August 16, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 7,043,750 shares of its common stock (including 918,750 shares issued as a result of the full exercise of an overallotment option by the underwriter) at a price to the public of $12.35 per share. The proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriter discounts and offering expenses, totaled approximately $82.9 million. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares.  From time to time, we expect to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares under our existing automatic shelf registration statements or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties, to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes. 

Contingencies 

From time to time, we may provide financing to Sponsored REITs in the form of a construction loan and/or a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage.  As of September 30, 2016, we were committed to fund up to $90.3 million to four Sponsored REITs under such arrangements for the purpose of funding construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs or for other purposes, of which $79.0 million has been drawn and is outstanding.  We anticipate that advances made   

34 

Table of Contents  

under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another other capital event. 

We may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business.  Although occasional adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Related Party Transactions 

We intend to draw on the BAML Credit Facility in the future for a variety of corporate purposes, including the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio and for Sponsored REIT Loans as described below. 

Loans to Sponsored REITs 

Sponsored REIT Loans 

From time to time we may make secured loans ( Sponsored REIT Loans ) to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other purposes.  We anticipate that each Sponsored REIT Loan will be repaid at maturity or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or some other capital event.  Each Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately two to three years.  Except for two mortgage loans which bears interest at a fixed rate, advances under each Sponsored REIT Loan bear interest at a rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR rate plus an agreed upon amount of basis points and also require a 50 basis point draw fee. 

Our Sponsored REIT Loans subject us to credit risk.  However, we believe that our position as asset manager of each of the Sponsored REITs helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the Sponsored REITs.  Before making a Sponsored REIT Loan, we consider a variety of subjective factors, including the quality of the underlying real estate, leasing, the financial condition of the applicable Sponsored REIT and local and national market conditions.  These factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors.  Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively. 

Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loans outstanding as of September 30, 2016, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loans, is incorporated herein by reference to Part I, Item 1, Note 2,  Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities, Management fees and interest income from loans , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 

Other Considerations   

We generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties.  The rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property, with the exception of one property located in Chesterfield, Missouri for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, and one property located in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

Our property located in Chesterfield, Missouri has approximately 116,000 square feet of rentable space and was approximately 43.7% and 96.2% leased as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  In January 2015, two tenants with leases for an aggregate of 99,000 square feet of rentable space vacated the property.  During 2015, we signed leases with two new tenants.  As of December 31, 2015, tenants occupied approximately 50,000 square feet of rentable space at the property and we had entered into a lease for 62,000 square feet of rentable space, but such lease had not yet commenced.  As a result of the vacancy during 2015, the rental revenue from the property did not cover operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The property generated rental income of $291,000 and had operating expenses of $296,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The property generated rental income of $547,000 and had operating expenses of $820,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Table of Contents  

Our property located in Minneapolis, Minnesota has approximately 170,000 square feet of rentable space and became vacant in January 2016.  During the first quarter of 2016, we evaluated development and redevelopment opportunities at the property.  On March 31, 2016, we commenced a redevelopment plan for the property.  As a result of the vacancy, we had no rental income and had operating expenses of $5,000 and $290,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.       

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Market Rate Risk 

We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements.  We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, if market rates on our outstanding borrowings under our BAML Revolver increased by 10% at maturity, or approximately 17 and 17 basis points, respectively, over the current variable rate, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by $0.5 million and $0.5 million annually, respectively.  Based upon our credit rating, the interest rate on our borrowings on the BAML Revolver as of September 30, 2016 was LIBOR plus 125 basis points, or 1.77% per annum.  We do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by borrowings under our BAML Revolver is material as of September 30, 2016. 

Although the interest rates on the BMO Term Loan and the BAML Credit Facility are variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rates on the BMO Term Loan and the BAML Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap agreements.  On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum until August 26, 2020 (the  BMO Interest Rate Swap ).  On September 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 0.75% per annum until September 27, 2017 (the  BAML Interest Rate Swap ).  On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks  that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 1.12% per annum for the period beginning September 27, 2017 and ending September 27, 2021 (the  2017 Interest Rate Swap ).  Accordingly, based upon our credit rating, as of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 3.97% per annum and the interest rate on the BAML Term Loan was 2.20% per annum.  The fair value of the BMO Interest Rate Swap, the BAML Interest Rate Swap and the 2017 Interest Rate Swap are affected by changes in market interest rates.  We believe that we have mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the BMO Term Loan through the BMO Interest Rate Swap until August 26, 2020.  We believe that we have mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the BAML Term Loan until September 27, 2017 through the BAML Interest Rate Swap, and from September 27, 2017 to September 27, 2021 through the 2017 Interest  Rate Swap.  The BMO Interest Rate Swap, the BAML Interest Rate Swap and the 2017 Interest Rate Swap were our only derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016. 

The table below lists our derivative instruments, which are hedging variable cash flows related to interest on our BMO Term Loan and our BAML Term Loan as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

Our BMO Term Loan and our BAML Term Loan hedging transactions used derivative instruments that involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in either or both of the contracts. We require our derivatives contracts to be with counterparties that have investment grade ratings.  The counterparty to the BMO Interest Rate Swap is Bank of Montreal, the counterparty to the BAML Interest Rate Swap is Bank of America, N.A. and the counterparties to the 2017 Interest Rate Swap are a group of banks, all of which have investment grade ratings.  As a result, we do not anticipate that either counterparty will fail to meet its obligations.  However, there can be no assurance that we will

be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies. 

The company s derivatives are recorded at fair value in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated Balance Sheet and the effective portion of the derivatives  fair value is recorded to other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statements of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion of the derivatives  fair value is recognized directly into earnings as other in the condensed consolidated statements of income.    

The interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the BAML Term Loan and BMO Term Loan, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current BAML Term Loan and BMO Term Loan are subject to a zero percent floor. As a result there is a mismatch and the ineffective portion of the derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $0.4 million and $0.6 million of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings, respectively, which is included in other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 

The BAML Revolver has a term of four years and matures on October 29, 2018.  We have the right to extend the initial maturity date of the BAML Revolver by an additional 12 months, or until October 29, 2019, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for up to $350,000,000 of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.  Upon maturity, our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates. 

We borrow from time-to-time under the BAML Revolver.  These borrowings bear interest at either (i) a rate equal to LIBOR plus 87.5 to 165 basis points depending on our credit rating at the time of the borrowing (LIBOR plus 125 basis points, or 1.77% at September 30, 2016) or (ii) a rate equal to the bank s base rate plus up to 65 basis points depending on our credit rating at the time of the borrowing (the bank s base rate plus 25 basis points, or 3.75% at September 30, 2016).  There were borrowings totaling $278 million and $290 million on the BAML Revolver as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately 1.70% and 1.54% per annum, respectively.  We have drawn on the BAML Revolver, and intend to draw on the BAML Revolver in the future for a variety of corporate purposes, including the funding of Sponsored REIT Loans and the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio.  Information about our Sponsored REIT Loans as of September 30, 2016 is incorporated herein by reference to Part I, Item 1, Note 2,  Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-consolidated Entities, Management fees and interest income from loans , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 

The following table presents as of September 30, 2016, our contractual variable rate borrowings under our BAML Revolver, which matures on October 29, 2018, under our BAML Term Loan, which matures on September 27, 2021 and under our BMO Term Loan, which matures on August 26, 2020.  Under the BAML Revolver, we have the right to extend the initial maturity date by an additional 12 months, or until October 29, 2019, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
